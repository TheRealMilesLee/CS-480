On Saturday afternoon, a man identified as a suspect in an April 7 bombing=
 blew himself up as he leapt off a bridge during a police chase, officials=
 said.Two militant groups posted Web statements claiming responsibility fo=
r the twin attacks -- the Mujahedeen of Egypt and the Abdullah Azzam Briga=
des. Neither claim's authenticity could be verified.Nine people, four of t=
hem foreigners, were wounded in the apparent revival of violence against E=
gypt's vital tourism industry.The two women who carried out the later shoo=
ting attack near the prominent historic Citadel site were identified as Ne=
gat Yassin, the bomber's sister, and Iman Ibrahim Khamis, his fiancee, bot=
h in their 20s.
