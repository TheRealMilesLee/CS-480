Morris, I was talking to Cindy Stark earlier today about the cost of doing research and how it will impact our cost centers.  She suggested that I touch base with you so you are aware we are attempting to retain our access to RDI and to Lexis-Nexis and make sure we are getting the best cost structure possible.  Kevin Hyatt was contacted by Paula Corey earlier about RDI and when I tried to get to my Lexis-Nexis this morning, I was blocked out.  I am waiting to hear from Paula on that issue to see what the cost of adding me back in will be.  Would you prefer we handle this differently?  I just want to make sure we are getting as much for our $$ as we possibly can.  We are planning to get just one license to share among our group.
 
Thank you for any input.  
Susan

We need PowerDat and GasDat.  Sign Kevin up as the user and we can share the userid.

Eric and Kevin,
 
According to Paula the estimated cost (pending) is $500 per user application and it could go higher depending on the response.  What do you think the?  1 or 2?
