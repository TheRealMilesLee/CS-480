   Word of the Day for Thursday March 7, 2002:

   malediction \mal-uh-DIK-shun\, noun:
   A curse or execration.

     There  Justice  Minister  Bola  Ige,  confronted  with  the
     general incivility of local police, placed a malediction on
     the  cads.  Said  the  Hon. Bola Ige, "I pray that God will
     make big holes in their pockets."
     --"Sic  Semper Tyrannis! Oppressors Face People's Justice,"
     American Spectator, May 1, 2001

     A  conspiracy  of  infamy so black that, when it is finally
     exposed,  its  principals shall be forever deserving of the
     maledictions of all honest men.
     --Joseph  McCarthy,  quoted  in  [1]Venona: Decoding Soviet
     Espionage in America, by Harvey Klehr and John Earl Haynes
     _________________________________________________________

   Malediction  comes from Latin maledictio, from maledicere, "to
   speak  ill,  to abuse," from Latin male, "badly" + dicere, "to
   speak, to say."
