Dannis and Mike,

Due to Financial constraints in November and December, all orders were cancelled.  Therefore to reorder, I would need for you to send me an email with your SAP Coding, Business Purpose and Manager Approval.

I then take that information and have to get IT Director approval, VP approval, CIO approval and CFO approval - This is still in force and to replace your order, please send me the email.

Thanks, Karon
