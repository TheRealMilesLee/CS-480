CIG
The terminated CIG OBA had language to cashout at the NGPL MidCon price in
the month after the OBA was terminated (10/31/01).
The 11/2001 index price was $2.173/dth * 1,443 dth = $3,135.64 due CIG
through October 31,2001.

Mojave
The old Mojave OBA does not have cashout language related to the 11/30/2001
termination date, therefore the current month pricing would be used for
cashout.
The March Bloomberg Natural Gas El Paso, Topock, AZ (Mojave) index price is
$2.30/dth * 162,111 dth = $372,855.30 due Transwestern through November 30,
2001.

Please let me know if you agree and I will prepare cashout documents.
