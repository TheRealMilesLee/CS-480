Mortgage rates are still attractive today, according to E-Loan, despite climbing from last year's lows. In fact, current rates are as low as those available for most of last year. With these low rates, you could still benefit by refinancing today. 

It's not too late to save
The Schwab Mortgage Center provided by E-Loan makes it easy to compare your rate to the current market <http://schwab.ed10.net/ud/QHF8/572F/0C6E/ID/D4IQ6M>. So you can quickly find out if refinancing now makes sense for you. 

At today's rates, many homeowners find they can still reduce their monthly payments - and put a little extra cash in their pockets. 

Why wait? Find a rate that's right for you.
