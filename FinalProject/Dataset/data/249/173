FYI - I have had numerous complains that the refrigerator in the main kitchen had a funny odor, and was told to call housekeeping. Housekeeping came by today to throw away food that was old, I monitored her and saw that she only threw away stuff that smelled bad or was already growing something on it! In order for her to air out the refrigerator she will need you to take your food home so that she is able to clean and sanitize the refrigerator.

Please see to it that you notify your group to take home all food containers.


Thank you,
Melissa Solis
