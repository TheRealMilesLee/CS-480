Testimonial from Bob H., in Colorado: I thought you may want to know the
results of my first call! This gentleman called last night telling me he had
a judgment that he hasn't attempted to collect since 1994. When I asked him
how much the judgment was for, he said $750,000.00! I almost fell off of my
chair! I just can't believe that my first call is one of this magnitude! So
far I have found it to be exciting and self rewarding to start my own
judgment recovery business from my home. I know that with persistence and
focus I can become very successful in this endeavor. I have been in the
J.O.B. (Just Over Broke) market for over 20 years and it is wonderful to
work from my residence, with the freedom to spend time with my daughter when
I choose to. No boss to tell me what I can and can't wear, say, think, or
what hours I need to work. I love to listen to the traffic reports in the
morning and night, knowing I don't have to participate any more. Thanks for
giving me the ability to do this, and mostly for your kind assistance with
me along the way.


The Buccaneers Once more the blacks formed a circle around our adventurer,
who coolly drew his tube and said to the chief: Tell your people I'm going
to walk away through those trees, and if any one dares to interfere with me
I'll paralyze him. The chief understood enough English to catch his meaning,
and repeated the message to his men
Having seen the terrible effect of the electric tube they wisely fell back
and allowed the boy to pass
