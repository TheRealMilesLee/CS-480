Below is Williams redlined version of our EOL Amendment.  They were questioning why we backdated the amendment.  This one was back dated because it did not have the language in it which addressed prior EOL Confirmations that were unsigned.  Can we add the following language that was used in other EOL Amendment versions for other companies which addressed that issue?

d. this Amendment shall apply to any EOL Transaction that has not been documented in a confirmation executed and delivered by both parties.

They mainly deleted the Financial language on the Annex.  Brent...can you call them today to discuss.  This would be a great amendment to get in place.  Their attorney's name and phone number is   Tracy Poole (918) 573-4818.

Let me know if there are any questions.  Thanks!

Kim Theriot

Kim 
        I am the contract administrator working with Cyndi in getting this completed. I have attached the Agreement with our redline changes.  We did not see the reason for having this retroactive back to January 1.
        Also Kim, we would like to have the same agreement  with Enron Gas Liquids and Enron Canada Corp. Can you handle that or can we add them as signatories to this Agreement?
        Please let me know if this version is acceptable or if we need to discuss. Thanks for your help.
