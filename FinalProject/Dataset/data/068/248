ISO Market Participants:
The California ISO is considering several modifications to the Automated
Dispatch System (ADS) to increase its usability and to provide additional
information to Scheduling Coordinators through the system.  These include:
*	providing additional real-time dispatch information through ADS;
*	modifying the query system to allow additional report generation
capability; and 
*	providing SCs with summary information of schedules, expected and
actual generation in real-time.  
To assist the ISO in assessing which new features would be beneficial, we
request your comments on the features we are proposing for development.
Additionally, the ISO would appreciate receiving ideas for additional
features not yet considered by the ISO.
We have posted on the ISO web site a white paper describing the proposed
modifications.  You can access the paper at
http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/06/12/200006121229457917.html
<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/06/12/200006121229457917.html> .
Please send your comments on the proposed design, as well as ideas for
further development, to Greg Ford at gford@caiso.com
