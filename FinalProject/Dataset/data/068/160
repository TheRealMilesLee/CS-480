No acceptance.

This is not enough info for me to accept anything.  We have a process which you will need to follow.  I suggest you talk to Sean Holmes and ultimately EWS' structuring group will have to get comfortable with all/any of the issues before I accept.  I expect better documentation than just an e-mail.

Richard what are the issues - this is the first thing I have EVER heard about this?

Rogers & Richard,

We are in the process of selling (transitioning) the Projects piece of the GSA Region 1 Deal to Enron Facility Services, with the commodity piece to remain the responsibility of EES. We would like to confirm that when EFS completes a project, the resulting reduced consumption figures will not adversely affect your commodity risk position.

Please indicate your acceptance of this transaction by responding to this email.

Regards,

Chris Wheeler
