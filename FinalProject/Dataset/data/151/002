Hello,
 I am contacting you to partner with me in respect of transfer of 
certain funds, which is being held in a floating account in my organization, 
Fountain Securities , in Madrid Spain. I am privileged to have full knowledge 
of the availability of this fund due to my function and position in the 
organization at present.

 I have to contact you because it is imperative for me have the cooperation of 
a foreigner to be able to transfer the fund out of my 
country. This fund, was deposited by Mr. George Martins, who died in 1994 
without leaving any information of any next of kin to inherit the fund. The 
account therefore has not been operated since his death.

The total amount involved is Fifteen Million American Dollars. My name 
is Douglas Morris. I would give the details of the transfer process if I 
receive your response and am convinced that you are willing and dependable to 
carry out the transaction with me in absolute confidentiality. We have to 
establish mutual trust such that it will be glaring to both parties that we 
could work with open mind. On transfer of the fund into your account, your 
share would be 25% of the total sum while the rest part would be for me and I 
intend to invest the major part of my share in your contry with your 
assistance.

I would appreciate if you could respond to me on my more private
email:douglas_morris@email.ro. Kindly state your telephone number so 
that I could call you too.
I await your response.

Sincerely.
Douglas Morris.
