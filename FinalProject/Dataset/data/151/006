Sounds good.

I called the other day to find out what URL you use for the streaming Bloomberg TV screen you have at your desk. Can you e-mail it to me?

  John,

  Thank you for the spreadsheet.  I will sit down and plug in my numbers after Thanksgiving.  Have a nice weekend.

  Talk to you soon.

    Mike - here is the spreadsheet I have used. You need to fill in the cells in yellow for starting values, the spreadsheet calculates the rest. You can also change the assumptions at the top (blue cells). Mortgage expenses are captured in line 33 but do not include taxes and insurance, just P&I. Make sure to include taxes and insurance in general annual expenses (line 47). 

    Just take a look and fill it in as well as you can and we can talk about any questions you have.
