Subject:	All tests were NOT successfully executed


All testing was completed this morning.  Through the web access, all systems tested successfully.  However, we've had numerous calls indicating that the TMS application cannot be accessed through the Start-Programs method.  

We contacted the ENW Resolution Center at 6:20 a.m. and were told that there had been a problem with the cluster last night.  They asked us to assure that everyone had logged off last night, and we did.  People reporting problems accessing the application through the start menu are advised how to access it from the web.  We have had a problem in the past where security rights are lost to the ETSTMS folder when there have been problems with the cluster.  A critical ticket has been opened, and the ENW Information Risk Management group has been paged.  We will keep you apprised of our progress.
