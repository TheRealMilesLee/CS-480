OK, for the Husker fans out there, in a time when I know you need a
boost in morale after the fiasco in Boulder Saturday...

Check this out...   

First, below is the current Bowl Championship Standings for this week...

http://espn.go.com/abcsports/bcs/rankings_full/index.html

Talk about respect for Nebraska.  Even after a 62-36 shellacking, they
only fell to #4 in the BCS standings.  Below are the possibilities for
each team in the top 6...

http://espn.go.com/ncf/s/2001/1119/1280619.html

So, you would think that would mean...   if two of the teams ahead of
you lose this weekend, you guys would be in the championship game.  By
comparison, Texas needs both Miami and Florida to lose to make it to the
game, because of strength of schedule, quality wins, etc.  

So, let's take that theory one step further...

1)  If both Miami and Florida lose you would think that would pit
Nebraska and Texas against each other in the Rose Bowl.  Wow, a Big 12
National Championship!

2)  Texas still has to beat Colorado.  If Texas loses and one of the two
top teams loses, it would seem like you guys are in as well.

But you know the computers will come up with some cockemamy calculation
that won't make any sense.

In closing, consider the following facts regarding this weekend's
games...

*	Miami could lose their last game away at dangerous Va. Tech.  A
win over the 'Canes would make the season for the Hokies (see Oklahoma
State).  Remember that Va. Tech was a top 5 team at one point this year
and they are playing at home.   Also...  Miami has lost 5 out of the
last 6 to Va. Tech!
*	Florida could lose to Tennessee -or- if they beat the 'Vols,
they could lose to what appears will be a very dangerous LSU team in the
SEC championship.
*	On the flip side - Tennessee could lose to Florida -or- if they
beat the Gators, could end up against that same LSU team.
*	Lastly, there is the Jekyl & Hide longhorns playing against the
Jekyl & Hide buffalos.

Hey...   stranger things have happened.  The possibilities are endless,
as they say at 1400 Smith (at least for now).  Of course, that may be a
dangerous correlation.

Mark
