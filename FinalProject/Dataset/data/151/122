Steve,
You will also find this of interest.  Evidently, the old material (possible PCB tainted) is moving into pipeline areas on SoCal's system previously undiscovered.  This is apparent since we are dry and non-detect for PCB's now at Needles.  The cost and attention to these matters will continue for TW.  John Shafer

Subject:	FYI, PCB mtg with SoCal

The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19 (86%).  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California.  On a similar note, while speaking to Ralph Komai, PCB person for SoCal, some interesting things are happening on their system and are presented below:

SoCal is beginning to notice accumulations of PCB pipeline liquids on portions of their system which has been considered PCB clean.  It is these portions of their pipeline for which they have been petitioning EPA to declassify.  These liquids are not new liquids introductions into the SoCal system but historic liquids that have laid in their pipeline. Because of the fact that Transwestern is not seeing liquids accumulations at the compressor stations upstream of Needles, we know that liquids are not being sent inot California.  Due to the increase of Transwestern gas into the SoCal system, it appears  the gas is sweeping old historic liquids into these new pipeline areas.    

SoCal will be meeting with PG&E within the next couple of weeks to discuss the discovery of pipeline liquids at an interconnect where SoCal provides natural gas to PG&E.The PCB concentrations are less than 5 ppm.  The location of this  interconnect is near Bakersfield, Ca.

Southwest Gas has requested that 2 filter separators be installed at 2 interconnects where they receive gas from SoCal.  As you know, Transwetern supplies gas to SoCal who then provides gas to Southwest.   The price of the 2 separators will be approx. $33,000 plus installation charges.  Ralph stated that theses charges will show up on the first or second quarter of 2002.  Of note, Southwest has asked SoCal to install each separator on the SoCal side of the interconnect which means that maintenance and operation of each separator will be SoCal's responsiblility.  these charges will be passed on to Transwestern at 86%.
