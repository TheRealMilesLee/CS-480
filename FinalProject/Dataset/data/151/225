Subject:	Letter from Tanya Plitsch

I propose to write a brief note to Mrs Plitsch to say that it was a matter is between the company and Mr Plitsch which has been settled with Mr Plitsch's participation. Mr Plitsch was given every opportunity to consult his lawyers and put his case but he declined. We take a very serious view of this abuse of our company's letterhead and chop, but would now consider matter closed. 

Please let me know if you think it ought to come directly from senior management (which I imagine would be too busy to attend to this). If not, I'll sign and send the letter tomorrow  (Singapore time) and copy to Mark Frevert with blind copy to yourselves. 

Thanks and regards
Matt

Mark, Alan,

This lady has written to most of the senior executives in the company trying to recover some of the money which we believe her husband misappropriated from Enron in Hong Kong. Matt Lee obtained orders freezing the husband's bank accounts and he immediately repaid us.

We have written at least twice explaining we are not prepared to pay any of this back. I'll ask Matt to do so again one last time.



					Mark
