Angela,

Please accept this as written documentation of the lower than normal flows to the Oneok extraction plant.

On September 10, 2001, at 23:10 PLT, Unit #29 dropped a valve in it's #12 power cylinder causing it to be declared not available. As a result we were unable to maintain the normal flow rates to Oneok. This situation existed until September 12, 2001 at 15:35 PLT, when the unit was returned to service.

If you have further questions or need more information please cantact me or Casey Winter at (620)562-4325.
