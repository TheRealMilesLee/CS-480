 FROM THE DESK OF BARRISTER. MIKE UGO (ESQ).
Email; mike_ugo995@yahoo.co.uk

Dear,
I am Mike Ugo Esq., a Senior Advocate of
Nigeria . I am the legal Representative to Mr. Harold
Lebron, a national of your country, who used to work
with Shell Development Company in Nigeria. Here in
after shall be referred to as my client.
On the 21st of April 2001, my client, his wife and
their only daughter were involved in a fire outbreak
in there residence. All of the family members
unfortunately lost there lives. Since then I have made
several enquiries to your embassy here to locate any
of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved
unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful
attempts, I decided to track his closest relations
over the Internet, hence I contacted you.
I have contacted you to assist in returning the fund
valued at 16,000,000.00 USD left behind by
my client before it gets confiscated or declared
unserviceable by the Vault bank where
this huge amount were Lodged. The said bank director
has issued me a notice to provide the relatives or
families of the deceased or have the account
confiscated within the next fourteen official working
days. For the fact that I have been unsuccessful in
locating the relatives for over 2 years now, I seek
the consent to present you as the family member to the
deceased, so that the proceeds of this account can be
paid to you.
Secondly he has a consignment tagged 'family
valuables' he shipped or lifted by as cargo to Europe
early the same year he died, according to the
information he passed to me, it is of a important to
him.
Therefore, if you are interested, endeavor to reach me
immediately on my other email as thus:
mike_ugo995@yahoo.co.uk  to enable me inform you the
modalities on how to carry out this project. I have
all necessary information and legal documents needed
to back you up for claim. All I require from you is
your honest cooperation to enable us see this
transaction through. I guarantee that this will be
executed under legitimate arrangement that will
protect you from any breach of the law.
Please get in touch with me as soon as possible to
enable us conclude in this matter.  Please get back to me through this my email address;    mike_ugo995@yahoo.co.uk
