Hi All-

Was thinking of doing a gift certificate to Mark's (a really great restaurant in Montrose) for Bob for Bosses day so he and Carolyn can have a night out.  If we each kick in $15, that will give us $120--am thinking that we could do a $100 GC, then I'll pick up a NYRangers shirt when I'm home this weekend with the other $20, or we could just do a $125 GC, whatever you guys want.  I've got a card for everyone to sign as well.  Any other suggestions are of course welcome--but either way, plese get me your $$ by the end of the day today since I'll run over there this afternoon and get the GC if we all agree on that.

Thanks,
Suzanne
