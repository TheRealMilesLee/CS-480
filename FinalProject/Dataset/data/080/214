All - 

Thank you for your participation in the phone screen process.  

As all the screens should be completed by tomorrow evening, please let me know if you are having any difficulties I might assist you with. 

Please e-mail Karen or me with feedback as to whether or not you think the candidates you screened should be brought in for an interview.  

Thanks,

Guys,

You have been selected to complete the telephone screening of external candidates for second and final round.  Each  candidate will be screened by two traders to ensure agreement on quality of candidates.   (these resumes have already been selected from c. 200 resumes by some of the ENA Traders).  

As in the previous Trading Track recruiting event, you will be given a few days to complete this.  The candidates will be expecting your call, there is no set interview time therefore allowing you flexibility to call in the evening from home if necessary.   Resumes, telephone numbers etc will reach your desk tomorrow morning.   All phone screens to be completed by Tuesday pm: 16th October.

Any questions please call myself or Adrianne Engler.

Thanks,

 Karen.
