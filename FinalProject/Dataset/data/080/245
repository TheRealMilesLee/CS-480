Hi Monika,

VSP does not provide you with an insurance card but your doctor will verify your benefits after you give him/her your name and date of birth and your social security number.  To find a provider you can call 1-800-877-7195 or go to the web site at www.vsp.com.  Please let me know if you need additional information.

Thanks,
Ivonne

Hello Ivonne,

I do not have an insurance card for the vision health plan. Can you tell me what I need to do to before I go to a doctor? Also should I find my own doctor or is there a list of names provided. Can you clarify this to me or tell me who do I need to contact for this?

thanks,
Monika Causholli
