Bob,
like others, our firm has issued a policy, restricting overseas travel to
the essential minimum, with certain countries being banned entirely.
Currently the US is not on this list, but I have to say, the list is subject
to change at short notice....Generally speaking, Terry´s comments sound like
a good idea. 

regards
Henning Bruttel
