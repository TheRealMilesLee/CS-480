Paige,

Kenny said you would be the contact to clarify on settlement date.  We have
seen some settlement language in the contracts stating that settlement is
done quarterly.

As of now, we added it into our form and are capturing the term if it is
stated.  Is there anything else you know that we should be capturing
regarding the settlement date?

Thanks,

Annie
