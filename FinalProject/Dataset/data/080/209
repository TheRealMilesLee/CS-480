Wow!  Does Enron Market the cool flying name thing I got when I opened your email?
You guys are amazing. Thanks very much for being such a fun group and for the compliment.
It is called Robert Parker's Wine Cellar Software, or similar, and available at wineenthusiast.com or, they also have a phone/catalog ordering option with the number on the site.  It is excellent.
Cheers!
Andrea
