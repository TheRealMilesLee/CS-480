Zachary,  

I have reviewed the terms of the various documents you provided to us relating to our proposed use of Barclay's on-line FX trading site.  Attached are redlined versions of each of these documents incorporating my comments.  Please give me a call if you have any questions or would like to discuss any of our requested changes.  

Anne
