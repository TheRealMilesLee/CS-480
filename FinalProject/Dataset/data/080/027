Louise:

In our meeting this week, I forgot to mention that we need to move the accounting responsibility for Onondaga from the gas group over to Chris Sherman and Billy Fleenor. Billy wanted me to check with you before they move it. If you're ok with this, please send me a return e-mail.

Thanks and regards,
