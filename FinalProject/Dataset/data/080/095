RE: TRANSFER OF ($18,000.000.00 USD EIGHTEEN MILLION
US DOLLARS)
 
ATTEN!
 
I want to transfer to overseas ($18,000.000.00 USD)Eighteen Million 
United States Dollars) from a Prime Bank here in South Africa, I want 
to ask you to quietly look for a reliable and honest person who will be 
capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up 
a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can 
serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me. I 
am Mr.Adams AfaM, during the course of our auditing I discovered a 
floating fund in an account opened in  our  bank in 1990 and since 1993 
nobody has operated on this account,after going through some old files 
and records I discovered that the owner of the account died without an 
[heir] hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out 
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. 

The owner of this account is Mr. William U. Smith, a foreigner, and an 
industrialist. He died since 1993 and no person knows about this 
account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other 
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that Mr. William 
U. Smith until his death was the manager of EagleEye [pty]. SA.
 
We will start the first transfer with Nine (9) million [$9,000.000] 
upon successful transaction without any disappointment from your side, 
we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining  amount to your 
account. I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a 
foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person 
here. We will sign a binding agreement, to bind us together in this 
transaction as soon as you indicate your interest. So please reply 
urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take.
 
The management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who 
has correct information of this account, which I will give to you, upon 
your positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable. 
With my influence and the position in the bank, we can transfer this 
money to any foreigner's reliable account which you can provide with 
assurance that this money will be intact pending my physical arrival in 
your country for sharing. I will destroy all documents of transaction 
immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place. I will 
use my influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of 
this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant 
ministries and foreign exchange departments.
 
Please, reply urgently giving me the following information:
 
(a) Your expected Compensation in percentage of capital/Income derived 
from Total Invested capital.
 
(b) Annual percentage tax on capital income in your country.
 
(c) Inflation rate in your country.
 
I look forward to your earliest reply as soon as possible to enable me 
to know the next step to take for immediate transfer into your 
account.And moreso don't forget to forward your phone number to me so 
that i can call you and detail you immediately.

    
Regards,

Mr.Adams Afam
