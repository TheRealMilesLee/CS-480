Bob,

I was going to write you to propose an alternative meeting venue, but my
firm has issued a stricter prohibition on all overseas travel and US
domestic travel (which stranded my colleagues who are already abroad on
business trips=they have to stay there until further notice). This is in
response to the anthrax incidents and the FBI's terrorism alert.

But, apart from myself, it may be worthwhile considering changing the venue
of the board meeting of November and January to countries that are not
actively participating in the retaliation.
Among the cities in which board members reside, places like Amsterdam,
Madrid, Paris and Milan may be safer. Perhaps we could consider Singapore
and Switzerland, too.

You are right that agendas for these two meetings are very full and
telephone conferences are not adequate. We should meet in person somewhere.
We could split them into several consecutive days' telephone conferences but
you have to get up early and we (including Azam and Steve) would have to
stay up late.

Terry
