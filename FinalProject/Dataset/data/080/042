Dear Sir.

This letter is anchored on a strong desire to establish a
business relationship with you. 

I am senator Florence Ita Giwa, from oil reach Bakassi
Senatorial District of Cross River State of Nigeria. I have
held several political positions and offices through
elections won and appointments. 

I am currently a senator in the Federal Republic of Nigeria
and a house Committee Chairperson on Budget and National
Planning. I am currently living in Abuja, the federal
capital territory..

I obtained your contact particulars from the Internet while
searching for an honest person I can confide with to carry
out a business investment in your country.

I am working towards owning a business investment
in your country in order to safeguard my wealth from the
fragile economy of my country Nigeria. I considered your
country a safer place for investment.

 My singular purpose for seeking for your partnership and 

assistance to transfer and invest my money in your country 

was because of my country law that prohibits every
politician 

and civil servant in Nigeria from owning and/or operating
foreign bank account and/or business investment.

The restriction was one of the established laws by the
Federal government of Nigeria to checkmate and stop the
rampant looting and misappropriations of public/government
treasury and illegal transferring of funds abroad from
Nigeria.

I would be eternally grateful if you can have the courage
to 

assist me to transfer my money through your account to your


country to enable me carry out the proposed investment. 

You will be handsomely rewarded as the investment will be

beneficial to both of us.

 You will be entitled to a certain percentage of the total
profit 

after tax of the invest.  

You will  be compensated with certain amount of money for 

providing  account for the transfer of my money to your 

country.

Take notice that this money I wish to transfer to your
country 

under this circumstance is from a genuine source.

 It has no criminal origin in its source and there
won&#8217;t be any 

illegality that would be attached to the transfer of the
money to your country through your account. This
transaction will be totally risk free provided you would
not expose me to anybody as the original source of the
money and the investment that will be done in your country.

The whole affair should be treated in absolute secrecy and 

confidential. I would not want any kind of exposure because
of 

my political position. 

If you are not capable to keep to this rule do not bother
to 

contact me even when you are interested in my proposal.

Take note that I will be responsible for the entire
expenses to 

facilitate the transfer of my money to your account.
You will not be obliged to any financial commitment to 

transfer this money to your account unless otherwise
specify 

by the remitting bank.

In our subsequent correspondence I will disclose the amount
of 

money I wish to transfer through your account and my
proposed investment in your country for your consideration.

When sending your response, if positive and sincere, kindly


include your private phone and fax numbers for
communications as I am not very good in computer and can
not be making use of my secretary in sending information
like this. I prefer communication by phone and fax to
emails. Meanwhile my preferred email address for your
response is: florence.giwa@caramail.com for your urgent
reply.

While thanking you in anticipation of your cooperation I
look forward for a mutual and prosperous business
relationship.

Kind regards.

Senator, Florence Ita Giwa.
