Dear Shelley:
Sounds like a good start on your list.  Feel free to add more as you think of 
them - you only have 15 names, and I am comfortable adding more.  
One question - is Kidsave International the organization you worked through?  
 Where are they located? 
We can talk more this weekend.  I'll see you Sunday!
Thanks,
Barbara
