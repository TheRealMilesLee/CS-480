Dear Architectural Digest Subscriber,

You have been selected to be part of a new interactive online reader
panel. As an Architectural Digest reader panel member, your opinions
will be instrumental to give us insight into our readers' likes and
dislikes, priorities and passions for home design and other products
and services.

To get things started, we need to learn a little more about you.
Simply click on 
http://click.condenast.email-publisher.com/maaafWeaaQZBOa3nTdqb/ 
or copy/paste the URL in order to visit us and fill out a brief
questionnaire. Upon completion, your email address becomes a unique
pin code that will accompany all future correspondence. That's it.
Nothing to remember, nothing to write down.

Then, from time to time we will be contacting you for your thoughts
and ideas on various products and services in our magazine. As a token
of our appreciation, we will be giving away Architectural Digest
calendars to the first 100 respondents.

We greatly appreciate your support.

Amy R. Churgin
Vice President and Publisher
