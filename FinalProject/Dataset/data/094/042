Sally - if you need additional data let me know.  As Torrey notes it looks as though the recent media reports have had no impact on the financial trading activity.  Thanks, Leslie

Hi Leslie,
 
As per our conversation, I have attached the graphs and trend data for the "top ten" counterparties. These graphs and data represent the EOL deal counts for each counterparty, by business day, since 9/24 and are based on Activity Reports run from the EOL database.
 
The trends are great, as all of the major financial counterparties are either doing business as usual, or actually increasing their activity with us slightly.
 
I will be in the office by 7AM tomorrow, so please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
 
Thanks,

Torrey Moorer
