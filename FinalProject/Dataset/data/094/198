bearish still but a matter of timing.  current rally a function of reshaping the curve with incremental stg still available to ecourage economic withdraws come december.  think recent increase in bullish fundamental situation is more a result of price (1.80 in bid week) than anything else.  Think that with this bidweek being, as we stand now, above resid and above the coal stack, fundamentals worsen considerably to the point where price must go down.  Still very bearish first half '02.
