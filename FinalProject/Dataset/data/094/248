Kim,
 
My name is Molly Vaughan and I work along side your Forrester Account Manager David Kobierowski to cover the relationship between Forrester and Enron. I was hoping for an opportunity to have a 10-15 minute conversation with you to find out more about your specific role and business challenges that you may be facing.  Based on that conversation, I will be in a better position to direct you to some of the research we have that addresses those specific topics.  Let me know when a good time for me to call would be.
 
Link to Forrester's homepage  -->  http://www.forrester.com/Home/0,3257,1,FF.html
 
I look forward to working with you,
 
Best regards,
 
Molly Vaughan
