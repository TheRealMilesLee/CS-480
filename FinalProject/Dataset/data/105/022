Bart-here is the information you requested.  One note, the work that Andy
Schiffrin has been doing on the Interconnection Agreement has been quite
significant, and represents the bulk of the fees.

To date, we have billed $44,722.21, which remain outstanding.  Copies of
these invoices are being sent separately.

In the months of September and to date in October, unbilled fees are
approximately $11,000.

As to future work, which would include negotiating and finalizing the
Interconnection Agreement and negotiating the sale agreement, I estimate
$30,000.

Let me know if there is anything else you need or if you have any questions.

Regards

John L. Keffer
