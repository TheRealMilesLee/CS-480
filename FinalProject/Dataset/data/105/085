Mark,

Thanks for the quick response.  Yes, working in Europe has been a good
experience and certainly intellectually stimulating on many levels.
However, I'm probably not going to consult in 2002.  Not exactly my "cup of
tea."  It can be less than fulfilling coming in and out of projects and
never having the opportunity to actually start and finish an opportunity.
With that said, I am grateful for the experience and have definitely varied
my skill set as hopefully reflected in my resume.

I would imagine life at Enron has been challenging with the constant change
and bad press as of late.  I'm hopeful the worst is behind Enron and
smoother waters lie ahead.

Anyway, anything you can do for me in terms of getting my resume into the
right hands would be much appreciated.

Mark

Mark,

I hope you have enjoyed your time working in Europe as much as I did.  I
have recently made a switch and I left the broadband group and joined
the Transwestern Pipeline Marketing team.

I'll talk to you later,

Mark

Mark & Scott,

As there has been significant changes at Enron over the last few months,
I
wanted to revisit employment opportunities at Enron.  With change comes
opportunity and I hope both of you have been able to adequately
capitalize.

My resume has been updated to reflect the work I have completed this
year.
As for my immediate schedule, I will be engaged in a consultancy
assignment
in Europe until November 9, 2001.  Thereafter, my schedule appears to be
open.  I am hopeful we will be able to talk again soon.
