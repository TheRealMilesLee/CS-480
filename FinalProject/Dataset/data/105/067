I just wanted to give you an up date on the review with Heather. My primary focus with her was taking on to much responsibility and not focusing enough on the end results of her project such as Renewables. She just needs to spend more time ensuring that the numbers being reported are correct and accurate the first time, not after it goes into production. There had also been a complaint from Fran that Heather is not involved enough with the daily routines and may be taking the group for granted when it comes to the day to day work. Heather agreed with that but the problem that she faces is that Nick, Fran and Sam use that inter messaging system to communicate instead of verbally and as a result Heather is left out. I was thinking of telling everyone that there should be no use of the messaging system for business related issues within our group and also implementing the assigning of responsibilities to people for a couple of weeks then rotating it around. That way nobody can say somebody else is not helping enough. All in all it went well otherwise. She is was very receptive to my concerns and readily admitted to areas of improvement.

Couple of other things that I got from the meetings that might help the group. The first is an informational meeting with settlements and maybe accounting to understand what they do with the reports that we send each month and secondly, another meeting (hopefully better) regarding VaR and how the reports that we produce are used.
