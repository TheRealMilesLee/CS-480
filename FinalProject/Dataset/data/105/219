<< PASS THIS ON TO ANYONE YOU HAVE AN E-MAIL ADDRESS FOR. 
If you receive an email titled: 
"It Takes Guts to Say Jesus" 
DO NOT OPEN IT. It will erase everything on your hard drive. 
This information was announced yesterday morning from 
IBM; AOL states that this is a very dangerous virus, much worse than 
"Melissa," and that there is NO Remedy for it at this time. 
Some very sick individual has 
suceeded in using the reformat 
function from Norton Utilities 
causing it to completely erase all documents on the hard 
drive. It has been designed to work with Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. 
It destroys Macintosh and IBM compatible computers. 

This is a new, very malicious virus and not many people know about it.Pass 
this warning along to EVERYONE in your address book and please share it with all your online friends ASAP so that this threat maybe stopped. Please 
practice cautionary measures and tell anyone that may have 
access to your computer. Forward this warning to everyone that you know 
that might access the Internet.
