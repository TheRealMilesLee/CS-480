Subject: [Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Derrick Alexander

Hi Folks,

Getting lots of "what happened to Derrick Alexander?" emails.

As you may have heard, the announcers for the game last night reported that
Alexander injured his ribs during pre game warm-ups.   Even the announcers
were not aware of it until after kickoff.   So don't beat yourself up if you
started him.   Nothing you could have done.   It's the same as if he were
hurt on the first play of the game.   Not much information right now as to
how serious the injury is but we'll keep you posted.   My guess is that
Larry Parker's 76 yard / 2 TD performance will have a very positive effect
on Alexander's recovery this week...

More as we hear it.

Joe
