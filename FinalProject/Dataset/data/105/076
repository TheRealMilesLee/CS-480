The Envision System will be down beginning Friday, October 26th at 5:00pm and will remain unavailable for use until Sunday, October 28th, 2001 at 8:00 am 
This is being done to comply with the scheduled building power outage performed by TrizecHahn Office Properties. 
The Three Allen Center Building, where the Envision equipment is located, has scheduled their annual building electrical shutdown on October 27, 2001. 
The shutdown is required to perform preventive maintenance on the main switchgear and any necessary repairs to electrical panels, bus ducts, equipment, etc. 
Access to the building will not be allowed during this power outage.
