The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bu|l market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oil Be|t"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Mil|ions per week.
Breaking NEws!!!
Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease opportunity in South Texas Providing opportunity 
for 22-We|l Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large Recoverab|e Reserves
South Texas in a large existing field that was discovered and dri|led by major oi| companies 
in the 197Os.The fie|d is established with substantial recoverab|e reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi|lion barrels of oil and about 2 bi|lion cubic ft. of gas in the two pay zones.
Symbo| - EOGI
Price - .12
Sell Target - .33 = Diamond P|ay
The value of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bul|
market in a generation.
2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.
3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-millions, EOGI is sel|ing for |ess than 1/4 the
value of its assets.
4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadruple returns.
Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly close attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This smal| company
with a comparab|y sma|l market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y with
the daily jump in energy prices.
But al| that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y exp|osive
effect on
the share price.
What wil| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in
the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or decline
slight|y, you wi|l still make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or
so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings wil|
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be
staggering.
Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares wil| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are well established and are going into massive production.
Ear|y investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additional news in this
area will real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bul|etin.
