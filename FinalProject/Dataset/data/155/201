I agree with George and think that we need to get these guys paid, if possible.

Guys - we have a $50 mm claim riding on this - it would appear that we have nothing but upside - if we lose we won't pay - if we win it's cash to us.  Brobeck is owed $2 mm - and we obviously need to pay the experts as well.  

Mark - I need some guidance on this - please advise.  Thanks,

George

We are continuing trial today. Our experts( Seth and Kip) are refusing to
work because they have not been paid.  This obiously will create problems if
we want to pursue our claim ( as we should do).  Thank you for your help in
making all possible efforts that payments.
