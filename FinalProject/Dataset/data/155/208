The tears rolled down my face the night Channel 11 broke through with the announcement that Enron was going to merge with Dynegy. My heart was breaking, seeing the hurt in Ken Lay's eyes and to see our company tumbling down as if it was the New York Trade Center this was my first thought and question how could a few cruel and selfish individuals bring something so wonderful down after so many years of hard work? The E means something to me. I'm so proud to be apart of this great company that you and Enron employees built. There are so many roomers of blame, but I can't for a second believe you had anything to do with this I know your a man of your word and speak from your heart and I'm so sorry you couldn't enjoy your retirement and had to come back to this mess. I just wanted you to know that I'm behind your decisions and have the utmost respect for you also. Hopefully some day the individuals that put this great company down will be held accountable and be made put the money they stole back to the company. Take care of yourself and your health we need you.
Sincerely, Velvet
