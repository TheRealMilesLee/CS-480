>The Direct Marketing Educational Foundation has an annual conference 
>bringing together MBA students from top programs and leading Direct 
>Marketing professionals.  This year, the program will be held Feb. 1-3 in 
>New York.  The program is intended for MBA students who have serious 
>career interests in direct marketing but who have not yet had a 
>significant amount of experience in the field.  More information is 
>provided in the attached document.  In the past, we have sent 2 and 
>sometimes 3 students to the program.

>This e-mail is being sent to second year Haas full-time MBA students and 
>evening program students.  I would prefer that the latter applicants be at 
>least in the second year of the program.  If you are interested in 
>attending and can commit to the dates, please send me a one-page resume 
>and a one-paragraph statement of how you would benefit from the 
>program.  The due date for getting this information to me is Monday, Dec. 
>3.  Please send it to my NYU e-mail address (I'm on leave here this
