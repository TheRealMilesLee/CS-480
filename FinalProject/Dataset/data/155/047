Steve, I just wanted you to know how sorry I am about the tragic events.  This has to have been so unbelievably difficult to understand for you and others who have made Enron such a powerhouse in terms of government affairs and the development of the intellectual underpinnings of our industry.  The entire industry is in debt to Enron for its leadership.  Call when the dust settles.  Lynne 202-628-8200
