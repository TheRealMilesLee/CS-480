ln an application to change your Original Bank Account, as published in our December 2004 article duly signed by him, he had purported that you brokered the Contract Payment to One Mr. Watson Michael of Watson Consultant Co. Uk to which you gave approval for Credit to this following below: 

STANDARD CHARTERED BANK.

SORT CODE: 06100258,
ABA #: 043900399.
A/C NAME: Watson Consultant Co. 

You are kindly requested to confirm if you brokered this Payment to Mr. Watson Michael or not. 

The Senate Committee suspected the application because, the duo of Barrister Shobola Alabi and Mr Watson Michael were unable to produce the evidence of requisite required documents inspite of the affidavit of claim. 

Kindly confirm the authenticity or otherwise of this application of request to change beneficiary Name/Account by Barrister Shobola Alabi. 
Note: As a matter of exigency, you are therefore required to call the Chairman Dr. Haruna Dada on receipt of this fax for an oral interview as concerns the subject matter. Your prompt response will be greatly appreciated. 

HARUNA DADA.
