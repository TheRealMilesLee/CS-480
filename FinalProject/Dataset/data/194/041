Attached are the EOL Firm Gas GTC, EOL Firm Gas GTC with Collateral Support, and a redline of the two.  For those of you who reviewed the last version and provided comments, thank you.  Please take a fresh read as material changes were made to Force Majeure.  Any further comments, please advise.

   

Carol, will you please completely "fresh read" both of them as a check for me.  Thank you.
