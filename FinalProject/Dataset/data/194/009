Eric,
 
Thanks for the news on our friends.  It sounds like everyone's getting along pretty well, all things considered.  I saw Enron on NBC Nightly News last night.  Tom Brokaw had a long special on the Congressional inquiry, and they had some footage of people leaving the building.  I also saw a shot of the trading floor on CNN yesterday from last year.  I saw Dick Jenkins, but couldn't see if there was anyone else I knew.  It's amusing to see how the media reports so many half-truths and misleading information.  
 
I got a call from Hector the other day but haven't had a chance to talk to him.  He recently got a job with the Clinton group in NYC, so he's pretty excited about that.  That's great that your brother's wedding is coming up.  Tell him congratulations for me.  Are you the best man?
 
Hope the bidding turns out well.  Happy surfing in the meantime!
 
Brian
