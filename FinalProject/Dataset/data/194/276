This is an Editorial written by an American citizen, published in
a Tampa
Newspaper. He did quite a job.


 IMMIGRANTS, NOT AMERICANS, MUST ADAPT I am tired of this nation
worrying
 about whether we are offending some individual or their culture.
Since
 the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, we have experienced a surge in
patriotism
 by the majority of Americans. However, the dust from the attacks
had barely
 settled when the "politically correct" crowd began complaining
about the
 possibility that our patriotism was offending others. I am not
against
 immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking
a
 better life by coming to America. Our population is almost
entirely comprised of
 descendants of immigrants. However, there are a few things that
those who
 have recently come to our country, and apparently some born here,
need to
 understand. This idea of America being a multicultural community
has
 served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity.
As Americans,
 we have our own culture, our own society, our own language and
our own
 lifestyle. This culture has been developed over centuries of
struggles,
 trials, and victories by millions of men and women who have
sought
 freedom.
 We speak ENGLISH, not Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese,
Russian, or any
 other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our
society,
 learn the language! "In God We Trust" is our national motto. This
is not some
 Christian, right wing, political slogan. We adopted this motto
because
 Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this
nation,
 and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to
display it on
 the walls of our schools. If God offends you, then I suggest you
consider
 another part of the world as your new home, because God is part
of our
 culture. If Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't like Uncle
Sam,
 then you should seriously consider a move to another part of this
planet. We
 are happy with our culture and have no desire to change, and we
really don't
 care how you did things where you came from. This is OUR COUNTRY,
our
 land, and our lifestyle. Our First Amendment gives every citizen
the right to
 express his opinion and we will allow you every opportunity to do
so.
 But, once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about
our flag, our
 pledge, our national motto, or our way of life, I highly
encourage you to
 take advantage of one other great American freedom, THE RIGHT TO
LEAVE!

Please pass this along if you agree.
