Greg said that the cash was not initially swept back up to ENA or Enron Corp. but he doesn't know where it went.  He is going to follow up on this point in the morning with someone else in his group.

Susan,

Did Greg say that the cash is still in ERMT or was it "swept" back up into ENA or Enron Corp.?

I just confirmed with Greg Whiting in Accounting that RMT made $ 250 MM contribution to ERMT.  (RMT obtained such funds through a capital contribution from ENA, which in turn received a $250 MM contribution from Enron Corp.)

Best regards,
Susan

Stuart,

Would you please send me your fax number so I can fax you the November 30th Trial Balance for RMT?

Thanks,
Susan
