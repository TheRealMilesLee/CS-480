Genesis Capital Corporation of Nevada is traded OTCBB: 
GNCP

Stock Outstanding
Public Float  3,000,000

Background:
One of the fastest growing segments of the housing market
is the housing needs of people over the age of fifty-five.
While this is already a large portion of the population,
over the next few years, all baby boomers will, hopefully,
reach age fifty five. This age group is the most affluent
segment of the population and providing for their special
housing needs presents a significant profit opportunity.  

Both retirees and older adults who are still working favor
condominium development because they no longer wish to
maintain the exterior of their home or their grounds and
because of the greater feeling of security offered by a
condominium development. The type of housing preferred
in active adult communities is either attached or
semi-attached ranch houses. Senior homes, whether one or
two story have their master bedroom on the first floor.  

The active adult communities developed in Connecticut
have all sold very quickly. These communities range in
price from the mid one hundred thousands to townhouses
selling for over half a million dollars. Recently,
development of retirement communities has started in
Long Island in New York with some being priced in the
six and seven hundred thousand dollar range.  

The difficulty faced by developers is that sites for
active adult communities are hard to find since there
are very few sites zoned for condominium development. 
Furthermore any cluster development is very difficult
unless the town water and sewer are available to the
site. 


Towns are anxious to have senior developments for the
following reasons:
1. Senior development generates taxes but do not use
town resources such as schools, police, etc
2. Senior developments allow older residents to stay
in the community

Consequently towns will usually grant zoning changes for
senior housing developments.

From a developer's point of view, senior housing is a
profitable, lower risk product for the following reasons:
1. Senior are usually cash buyers and are relatively
unaffected by changing interest rates.  
2. Seniors will pay more per square foot of housing than
other homebuyers; consequently, the profit margins are
generally larger.
3. Given the difficulty to find good sites, most approved
sites face little or no competition and sell very quickly. 

Despite the desirability and potential profitability of
active adult communities, the majority of towns in the
Northeast do not have any such communities due to the
difficulty of finding appropriate sites.  

Business Plan:  
To develop active adult communities consisting of
condominium developments which are restricted to residents
fifty-five years of age and over. The initial development
projects will occur in the northeast portion of the United
States. Thus far 5 towns in Connecticut have been chosen
for development of 300 to 400 condominium units. The
estimated sales price for each unit is between $175,000
and $250,000.  

Thru it's subsidiary Senior Lifestyle Communities Inc.,
GNCP owns or controls 5 sites:
East Windsor, Hebron, Watertown, New Milford, and Granby
The company business plan is to build out the condominium
units on the existing sites, and buy additional sites in
Connecticut and New York. Additionally the company plans
to acquire and merge with a Regional Construction company
so as to control costs of construction and accelerate the
time to finish the projects as well as participate in
revenues and profitability from other construction.     

Timing:
The land for each development is initially optioned 
for due diligence period during which site approval
is obtained, which includes zoning, land use, wetlands,
water and sewer approvals for the subject site. After
approvals are granted by the municipality then the
land purchase is consummated with the seller and the
land is purchased from the seller. Normal process would
then include an Acquisition and Development loan from
a local Bank for payment of the seller and payment
for development of the site including roads, water and
sewer to the property. Condominium units will mostly 
be presold to the condominium users and units will be
built with construction financing from a local Bank.  
Construction will be done by contracting out building
to a local bonded builder.  

It is anticipated that the permitting for development
of all sites will be achieved by the spring of 2002 and
5 sites could be under construction by summer of 2002
