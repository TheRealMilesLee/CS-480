Teb,

Regarding the end date, we are being required to put some sort of end date into our system.  We can always go back in to extend should the assignment go beyond that date.  Would you like me to extend it for 3 or 6 months, or through the end of 2002?

I'll wait to hear back from Debbie on the coding.  

Thanks for the update!
Liz

Hi Teb,

I am trying to verify if Jeanette Doll is still on assignment. Listed below are the Co #s and CC #s that Jeanette has been charging her time to. Could you validate if these cost center numbers are still active or inactive?. Is the Company Name and Department the same?   Also, please let me know if there are any cost center numbers that need to be added or deleted.

Transwestern	GPG-TW Rates	0060	111004	

Lastly, is there a tentative end date for this assignment?

Thanks!
