Hey Eric....sorry for the delay - I sent your brother an e-mail right after
I got this one saying that unfortunately I wasn't going to be able to make
it b/c I just started a new job and unfortunately will only be able to ask
off for the wedding weekend (long enough sentence for you).  Thanks for the
invite and I will definitely make up for the loss at the wedding.  Let me
know if there is anything else I can do - by the way - where are they
registered????  Do you know?
Let me know. Thanks.
Jeff

> The time has finally come for us to mourn the loss of another one of our
fallen brethren.  Yes Jason Bass, my brother, will be getting married Feb.
2.  So, with that in mind it is time to set up the festivities for the
bachelor party.
>
> The party will be Saturday, Jan. 19.  I was thinking about taking the
gambling/drinking cruise out of Freeport (about 30 mins south of Houston)
called The Texas Treasure (www.txtreasure.com).  The cost should run about
$50 a person for the cruise - drinks and "gourmet" dinner included or
$35/person for drinks and buffet dinner.  Let me know which one you would
prefer.  I personally prefer the better dinner.  Gambling expenses are not
included in the above calculations.
>
> The cruise sails from 7PM - 1AM.
>
> Let me know if you can make it and, if so, what choice of dinner you would
like ASAP so I can make arrangements.
