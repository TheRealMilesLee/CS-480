I appreciate you moving so quickly on this. However, before we do anything, I need to see what you are proposing and visit with rod.
Thanks.

Kevin,

Donna and I are working on the floor plan.  We have you slotted to move with us (although we don't know exactly where yet), but we were not sure if we needed to make space for anyone else that works for you.  An assistant?  Davis Thames?

Please advise.

Thanks,
Kim.
