That deal should have already been moved. It was on Stacey Richardson's Master Cumulative list as having been submitted with the "Auto-termination" project she was working on. If it is still showing in the "Live" books, it should also be moved to the "Bankruptcy" side.

Thank you!!

can you tell me why EH6453.2 is not on the list?  We are moving EH6453.5, in the comments it says it is an unwind of leg 2.  Counterparty is Boston Gas.  Thanks.
