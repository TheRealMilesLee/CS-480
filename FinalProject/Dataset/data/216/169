Pleasure to have spoken with you last night concerning your interest in
arranging for 7-10,000 sf of office space.  Will be pleased to represent
your organization in this effort.  I will have the Pre-Lease Planning
questionnaire delivered to you this morning.  Please let me know what time
works for you on Monday.   Look forward to working on your behalf. M
