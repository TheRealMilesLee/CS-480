Dear Sir=2C

First I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction and I
pray that my contacting you will be given genuine approval considering the fact
that we don't know each other before=2E I wish to use this opportunity to
introduce myself to you=2E I am Antony Ovo=2C I am writing to inform you of
my desire to invest in any profitable business venture=2C and to buy a house
or campground in your country=2E

I am the first son of Chief Joseph Ovo who was the former Para month
ruler of saradungu village of Sierra-Leone =2Emy father was attacked by the
R U F rebels on his way to Lucia a northern part of Sierra-Leone and my
father sustained injuries and he died three days=2E

Before he died he revealed to me about the two boxes containing Gold Coins
valued at $15 million US dollars=2E Which he deposited with a security company
in Ghana for safe keeping=2E My father did not disclose the content of the
boxes to the security company=2E To avoid the officials from raising eye brows=2E

Presently I and my mother are here in Ghana to notify the security company
of the claims=2C and we are staying in the refugee camp=2E

Therefore I want you to lecture me on how best we can invest this money in
your country=2C because my father told me that it is dangerous to invest in Africa
to avoid suspicions=2C and due to market instabilities coupled with economic and
political situation facing Africa for your assistance myself and my mother
have agreed to offer you 20% of the total amount of the money=2E

We have all the vital documents covering the deposit and the ownership which
I can send to you upon getting a positive response from you indicating your
willingness to assist us=2E
=2E
Note=2C I have never disclosed this transaction to anybody apart from you=2E So
please=2C so please treat with utmost confidentiality and for a more easy effective
communication I would want you to furnish me with your direct telephone and fax numbers=2E


Yours sincerely

Antony Ovo
