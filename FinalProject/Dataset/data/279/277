I have made enquiries and think that there are two options - seek help from a landowner in Sydney, Australia who is known to my employer, or apply to the government for transport across the ocean. I think this is the best option. I hope the government will care for us better than a stranger on the other side of the world. I will make our application today. We have been successful! We will have assisted passage to Sydney one month from today. We sail from Birkenhead, which I am told is in the north of the country, across the river from Liverpool. I have many things to prepare before we leave, and I need to plan how we will travel to the ship.
