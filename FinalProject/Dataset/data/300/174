  <tr>
    <td width="50%">Dermisonics, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: DMSI) is a - 
    presently - little known company that has made some incredible breakthrough 
    discoveries in drug delivery. Most drugs have to be ingested orally or 
    injected. But, if you take a pill, the drug could be destroyed by stomach 
    acids and not be effective, or as often happens, the drug could produce 
    toxins in the body and affect the liver. However, when a drug is absorbed 
    through the skin in a transdermal patch the stomach and liver are not 
    affected and the patient gets the full dose, without any unforeseen side 
    effects.
    <p align="center"><b><font size="5" color="#02416A">So why don't more 
    drugs come in patch form???</font></b></p>
    <p>The last twenty years have seen incredible, miraculous discoveries in 
    drug therapies by pharmaceutical companies that now rake in BILLIONS of 
    dollars - every year. Most of these drugs are derived from protein - peptide 
    molecules. But, these molecules are just too big to make it through the skin 
    -- unassisted that is. </p>
    <div align="center">
      <h2><font color="#02416A">So why not figure out a way to get drugs through 
      the skin with a device?</font></h2>
    </div>
    <p>Well, Dermisonics now has and it's a huge breakthrough discovery. The 
    Company figured out something no one had thought of before - hook up a 
    regular transdermal patch to a miniature ultrasonic device that opens the 
    pores of the skin and pushes the drug through the layers into the tissue 
    where it acts just the way an injection would. </p>
    <p>And it works. The Company took insulin and tested the patch (called the 
    U-Strip) on real live healthy humans and proved in a Human Pilot Trial that 
    they can deliver insulin. </p>
    <div align="center">
      <img src="http://www.bull-and-bear.tv/email_newsletter/test_volunteer2.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="200"><br>
&nbsp;</div>
    <p>Of course, Dermisonics filed patents to make sure their idea was 
    protected and the US Patent Office has just told the Company that they are 
    allowing the first of their patents - a patent which covers ALL the major 
    technology invented by Dermisonics. </p>

    <p>Not only are there millions of TYPE I (Juvenile Onset) diabetics out 
    there suffering with daily insulin injections, there are over 150 million 
    TYPE II Diabetics (a global PANDEMIC caused by junk food and the couch 
    potato lifestyle) WHO WON'T TAKE INSULIN because they don't want to inject 
    it. These Type II diabetics take all sorts of other pills to try to control 
    their blood sugar. Some end up disabled, blind or amputees because of the 
    ravages of the disease. </p>
    <p>However, imagine how easy it would be just to stick on a patch with 
    insulin connected to a miniature device the size of a credit card and dial

        talk about my pick of the month: </font> <br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <div align="center">
          <h3><font color="#FF0000">Dermisonics Inc., DMSI</font></h3>
        </div>
        <p><font color="#000000">The American Diabetes Association estimates 
        that there were 145 million diabetics worldwide last year. The Center 
        for Disease Control reports that diabetes In the US has grown by 61% 
        since 1991 and that there are 7 million undiagnosed cases. </font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">The annual market for diabetes therapies in the 
        US alone exceeds 6 BILLION dollars. </font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">Now what would happen if Dermisonics only 
        captured a TINY ¼ of 1% of the domestic US market of 17 million 
        patients—let’s just say 42, 500 users of the system?</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000">Well, first it would realize</font> <font color="#FF0000">
        $53 million in sales
        </font><font color="#000000">of the ultrasonic transducer – that’s like 
        selling the razor. Then follow the razor blades. The patient uses a new 
        patch every single day that costs $2.50 per day translating into</font> <font color="#FF0000">
        $38 million of recurring revenue every single year</font><font color="#000000"> 
        – even better it's all covered by insurance and cheaper than the 
        competition – Minimed’s $4,000 a unit invasive insulin pump. </font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">Want to talk about real life numbers. Well, on 
        May 30, 2001, Minimed was bought out by Medtronic for $3.7 BILLION on 
        revenue of $256 million – </font> <font color="#FF0000">14 TIMES 
        REVENUE!</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000">Plus Dermisonics' technology is easier to use 
        than Mimimed’s Pump, has none of the problems associated with having to 
        open ports in the patient’s stomach and is much less bulky and 
        inconvenient. Yet there are over 300,000 pump users worldwide today.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000">Based on Dermisonics' estimate of 42,500 users, 
        a fraction of a fraction of the potential world market, Dermisonics 
        would have recurring annual revenue of $38 million not to mention the 
        fact that the transducer has to be replaced every 2 years. So, that 
        means</font>
        <font color="#FF0000">at least $100 million a year in sales.</font></span></p>

        <p><font color="#000000"><span style="font-weight: 400">Forget about 
        valuations of 14 times sales, if Dermisonics trades at just 4 times 
        sales, that means the stock goes from around $1.00 where it is today to 
        more than $10.00 per share. And that’s with <b>ONLY ONE QUARTER OF ONE 
        PERCENT OF ONLY THE US MARKET AND FOR ONLY ONE PRODUCT LINE!</b></span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000"><u>Now you know</u> why DMSI could easily go to 
        $10 a share!</font></p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="5" color="#02416A">DERMISONICS 
ALREADY HAS IDENTIFIED AT LEAST 175 DRUGS THAT COULD BE DELIVERED USING IT'S OWN 
PATENTED U-STRIP TECHNOLOGY</font></b></p>
<p>Many of these are coming of patent and are blockbuster sellers. Do you think 
drug companies like Pfizer, Schering, Eli-Lilly, Sanofi-Aventis or GSK might be 
looking for a partner to help them extend patent life on drugs and protect 
billions in revenue in the worlds MOST PROFITABLE industry? <br>
<br>
This really has to be one of the best buys of the year, if not the decade, 
because in addition to all the above, there is yet an: </p>
<p align="center"><br>
<br>
<b><font size="6" color="#02416A">EVEN BIGGER OPPORTUNITY OUTSIDE THE MEDICAL 
MARKET</font></b></p>
<p>A lot of people have seen the Sonicare ultrasonic toothbrush that has sold in 
the millions. What about an ultrasonic &quot;wand&quot; a handheld device to make all 
those billions of dollars of face creams and skin nutrients work much better? 
Think of the impact. Suddenly, that wrinkle cream really works because it 
doesn't just stay on the outer layer of the skin clogging up pores, but really 
penetrates. Dermisonics is working on this also, as well as designing its next 
round of human tests for the U-Strip. <br>
<br>
<b><font size="5" color="#FF0000">Just go to the </font></b><font size="5"><b>
<font color="#FF0000">Dermisonics website: </font>

for more exciting info.</font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>No wonder</b> that noted highly-conservative German research 
analyst Dr. Georg Hochwimmer of General Research GmbH rates Dermisonics a 
&quot;Speculative BUY with tremendous upside potential for investors prepared to take 
risks.&quot; <br>
<br>
AND THOSE GAINS ARE JUST FOR &quot;NORMAL&quot; COMPANIES SO <br>
<br>
<b><font size="6" color="#FF0000">BUY DERMISONICS (DMSI) NOW</font></b><br>
<br>
And <u>now</u> is the time to add this hot medical device stock to your 
portfolio.<br>
<br>
<u>Reason</u>: The Company is in the early stages of R&amp;D, so you and I are 
getting in on the ground floor - or close to it. Plus the stock is at its lowest 
ever - a low risk entry point. <br>
<br>
Right now, Dermisonics researchers know that they can deliver a host of drugs 
transdermally and solve a multitude of problems for big pharmaceutical 
companies. <br>
<br>
Once they move ahead with the next set of pilot trials or form an alliance with 
a big company the share price could easily skyrocket. Ten fold? Twenty fold? 
Possibly even more, because the potential here is nothing short of HUGE. <br>
<br>
<font size="4">My recommendation:</font><font size="4" color="#FF0000"> <b>Buy 
Dermisonics</b></font><font color="#FF0000"> <b><font size="4">today at 
the market price.</font></b></font> Since this is a highly speculative trade, 
though, please do limit your position here to a small percentage of your overall 
portfolio. <br>

                    FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: Except for historical
                    information contained herein, the statements on this website

                    pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private
                    Securities Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements
                    involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may
                    cause a company's actual results in the future periods to
                    differ materially from forecasted results. These risks and
                    uncertainties include, among other things, product price
                    volatility, product demand, market competition and risk
                    inherent in the companies operations. You can identify these
                    statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to
