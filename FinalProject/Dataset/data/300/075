goals more attainable.''

and mental guidance to area youth through a wide range

TV analyst, and current Head Men's Basketball Coach at
New Mexico State University, and Kellen Winslow, a
member of the NFL Hall of Fame, the initial focus of
publicly held Intelligent Sports, Inc. is to introduce
a new generation of youth to athletics through the
development of organized youth sports programs and
facilities throughout the country.
