That date is perfect.  Ian will be joining us.  Marc will be also
(possibly).  When do you think you'll have more specifics on timing and the
exact people we will be meeting with (can you send along their titles also).

Thanks so much!!

Hope you guys have a great weekend with your family.  Wish me luck in Santa
Barbara.

Just to warn you, my mom is inviting Linda and Keith for Christmas.
