We are certainly two different companies.  At first blush, the stable cash flow from the utility business is certainly a good thing.  A foothold in PJM may also be beneficial.  Combined market cap would be about $25 million--debt-to-cap still high, offset by more stable cash flows.  EXC's ROA and ROE appears much stronger.  More later....

Thanks
