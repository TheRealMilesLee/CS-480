              Maria Bartiromo reporting:

              I'm also watching Enron.  Enron continues to trade down.
              There are so many rumors going around that--about that
              company right now, which I will not pass on to add to the
              confusion.  But it has been a tough situation for Enron.
              The stock this week down fifty percent.  And there's talk
              we could see another executive resignation.  (Graphic:
              Enron Corp (ENE) one year stock chart)  Already we have
              heard about the CFO being replaced and, of course, Jeff
              Skilling, the former CEO, leaving earlier in the year,
              which really went from bad to worse with regard to the
              situation of Enron shares.
