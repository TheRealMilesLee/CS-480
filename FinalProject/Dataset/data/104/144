Hi Kevin,
This is great!  Yes I will follow-up with Dave regarding the article. I do
recall the discussion. He is out of the office today, but I will check with
him on Monday.  Thanks!

including "Changing gas quality specs and their impact to turbines" and
"Pressure Reliability".  He is preparing his initial draft which should
be available in the next two weeks.

Please forward to him a conference invitation at your earliest
convenience.  Contact info is as follows:

Mr. Colin Wilkes

Also, when you, me and Dave met at the P.O. DoubleTree, Dave mentioned
an article he saw dealing with LNG gas specs and their impact to gen
units.  He was going to try and get me a copy of the article and check
into whether or not the author would want to present at the conference
(at least that's my recollection).  Can you follow up with Dave to see
if he's had any success?

thanks
kh
