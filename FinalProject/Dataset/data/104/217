Theresa:
I found the offset for the 10/00 Crestone sale.  The deal was reversed under Enron Midstream and rebooked as Crestone.  I will net the two invoices for a zero balance.  You do not need to look any further.  Sorry if I caused you some work.

Megan,
I'm not sure why this is showing up.....I think it must have something to do with the name change from Enron Midstream to Crestone....

Let me pull out my Oct 00 file and see what invoice # we finalized then because I'm pretty sure they paid us.

I'll try and get to this later today.

Thanks,
Theresa
