I've been asked to pull together a "road-map" of the list of due dilligence items that need to be vetted on full requirements deals for Origination's off-site meeting next week.  I have drafted an initial list, attached below, but would appreciate any feedback you can offer on additional items or detail.  Thanks

- Jim
