Dear Church Family,

It's time to fall back! Daylight Savings Time will go into effect Sunday, 
October 28th at 2 A.M.  Remember to turn your clock back 1 hour before 
going to bed Saturday night and enjoy an extra hour of sleep. 

We look forward to seeing each of you in Worship and Bible Study this weekend.
