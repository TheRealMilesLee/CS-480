Sara and Marie,

Yesterday we moved positions from several futures brokers to Fimat Derivatives Canada.  We had an account there previously, A/C # K2300.

They are requesting account documentation forms be signed today because our prior account with them was under HSBC and they want to get it directly in the name of Enron North America.

They are e-mailing account forms to me today and I will forward to both of you as soon as I receive.

Gary and Jeff Shankman requested that we move positions to FIMAT.

Sheila
