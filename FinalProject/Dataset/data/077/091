Here is a message I received from Buddy this morning. I copied it and
deleted all the addresses at top, it was so long. It was sent to him by his
daughter-in-law who works for a law firm in Houston. 

[Sinclair, Nancy] I received this email - thought it was worth passing on 
just in case. 


FYI - I was very skeptical of this e-mail so I called the telephone number 
and it really was Laura Katsis at work.  She said that she did 
write and  send the e-mail in reaction to what her girlfriend told her. 
This could still be a hoax, but I am taking it a little more seriously 
knowing that Laura is a real person who admits writing the e-mail and who
stands behind what she wrote. 
  
Hi All - 
  
I think you all know that I don't send out hoaxes and don't do the 
reactionary thing and send out anything that crosses my path. 
This one, however, is a friend of a friend and I've given it enough 
credibility in  my mind that I'm writing it up and sending it out to all of 
you.    My friend's friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a 
month ago.  She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up.  She was
understandably upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied.  On
9/10, she received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he wished he
could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it had to be like that.
The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get on any commercial
airlines on 9/11 and to not to go any malls on Halloween.  As soon as
everything happened on the 11th, she called the FBI and has since turned
over the letter. 


This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on. This came 
from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last 
night.  I may be wrong, and I hope I am.  However, with one of his warnings
being correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the
second and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same
information that I did.
