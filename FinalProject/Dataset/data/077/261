Subject: Comments On Technical Conference, RP00-336



Attached is a draft of Richardson Energy's comments on the technical conference in El Paso's Docket No. RP00-336. The comments must be filed on Monday  October 15, 2001.

 As discussed at the conference, Richardson's comments focus on opposition to El Paso's proposal to split its 6 existing pooling points into 20 points. From past discussions, we hope and anticipate that your company or client will be taking a similar position. In that regard, we are circulating these draft comments to facilitate the presentation of common positions by similarly situated parties. We hope this draft will be of help to you in preparing your comments.

Thank you.
