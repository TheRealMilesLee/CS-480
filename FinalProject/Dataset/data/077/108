     With all the fear going around, I feel I should warn you of a
possible "scare-tactic" I have heard of that might occur on April 1 of next
year.....

     I have a friend who has a friend who dates his cousin who has a
contact at a company where a guy has a friend who knows someone who trades
natural gas basis.

     Apparently, this person went to Sullivan's in Houston the other
night and overheard a story that shivered my timbers.   He said that he
heard some well dressed guys talking in hushed tones about natural gas
prices.  He overheard that there was a rumor going around at one of the
guy's offices that a gas trader there has a friend who heard this story
from
a scheduler who knows a power trader who dates a lease crude buyer who has
a
cousin who works in accounting at a publicly traded company that does
business with a pinto bean grower in South Texas.

     Apparently, on April 1st, some strangers will be going around with
their index finger pointed out of a closed fist.  They may look like they
are pointing the finger.  They may approach you for assistance with their
finger.

     DO NOT PULL THEIR FINGER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

     This may or may not be real but I am sending it out to those I care
about.

Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
