Attached is the regulatory briefing presented today to Stan Horton, Peggy Fowler, Mark Metts, Jim Piro, Mary Turina, Steve Hawke and a group of other folks (who were here for the PGE/Enron budget discussions).  Note that Mark Dodson participated in the regulatory briefing (but not the budget meeting) at Peggy's invitation.  Jessica Uhl participated by phone.  Mike Morgan joined me at the table.  

    

FYI.  All the timelines were presented as "proposed, draft" and "very aggressive."  We also noted that the proposed October 19 meeting with FERC staff and the October 16 meetings with the Oregon parties would be key meetings.  

One change in the briefing since the meeting:  Mark Metts, Kristina Mordaunt, and Mark Dodson should be included as part of the "SEC Team."
