Kevin,

A consultant (Energy Consulting Group) in Ga. representing an "A-rated EMC" is looking for 75MW, 7x24, Jan-Feb'02, firm LD energy, "on" (not "into") the Ga-ITS (that is from any generation source on the ITS, or thru the interface and on the ITS).

From what I know about the Energy Consulting Group, they represent 8 of the larger EMC's in Ga.  We are going to meet with these guys in 2 weeks to see what deals they have available.  It looks like it may be a good opportunity for more short positions on the Ga-ITS.
