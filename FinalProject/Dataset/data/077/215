In a surprise procedural development, FERC has announced that it will accept written comments by both parties and non-parties to the ALJ's recommendations issued last month.  These comments are due by 10/31.  This is somewhat unusual because the case has been fully litigated and briefed and we had expected the full Commission to vote on this matter next week.  Some people think FERC is simply buying itself more time because it is preoccupied with other matters (although I'm not sure why they wouldn't simply just sit on the case for a few more weeks if that was the case).  A few parties have been in touch with Sen. Cantwell's office - they do not believe her office has been lobbying FERC - although they also report that Cantwell's staff is working on a letter to FERC to express her general dissatisfaction with the ALJ decision.  Another big concern in Cantwell's office is minimizing the refund liability of PNW parties in the CA case.  

In light of these developments, perhaps we should contact Cantwell's office to discuss the case and its implications for the PNW.  Also, it appears that Sen. Murray is not so upset about the ALJ decision and views the whole affair much differently than Cantwell - maybe we should touch base with her as well.  From what I understand, the City of Seattle (the main driver for the refund proponents) was prepared to pack it in - they may see this as a second chance, and we should make sure our view gets heard.
