Michael - as I said in my voice mail message - Lisa has mentioned two separate issues identified in the bullet below - in CA there is a Zero Emissions Vehicle Program designed to increase the use of ZEVs and there is also a Mobile Emission Reduction Credit (MERC) Program geared towards allowing mobile emissions reductions to be used as offsets for stationary source emissions.  Do you need info on both or one or the other?  Thanks
