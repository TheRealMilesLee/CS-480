Vince,
 
We are searching CERA, DOE, and EIA websites for information on US investment in gas infrastructure for Terry Thorn.  Do you know of any good sources or reports.
 
Thanks,
 
Maureen
 
P.S. Today I'm working on the GMM at home.  My calf and Achilles tendon were very stiff and felt like they had a charlie horse.  I hope to be in tomorrow.

I have broken both ankles twice in sports accidents but the worst was when I tore ligaments. It required a cast and took forever to recover. I will bet I have arthritis some day in one of the ankles. Ironically, most of the soft tissue damage, which takes so long to heal, is not caused by the accident per se but by the swelling afterwards which damages the tissue. That's why immediate ice is so important. Sorry about the medical lecture, but I have been there and when I read your note memories returned. The trick now is to get good circulation in the area of eth injury to remove the fluids et al. Ouch! Hope it's a quick recovery.
 
Thanks for keeping me on the list. I enjoy and use your reports. Have you ever seen anything that tracks US investment in gas infrastructure? When you're more mobile, let's have lunch. Thanks again

Terry,
 
Today is my first day back.  I severely spained my ankle and tore several tendons and ligaments.  I feel bad that I was unable to respond to your last request, I will have you added to our distribution list with pleasure.  Please keep in touch.
 
Maureen
