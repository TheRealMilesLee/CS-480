Here rests a happy man, that is to say, a man of high birth and position,
which was very lucky for him, otherwise he would have been scarcely worth
notice. It is beautiful to observe how wisely nature orders these things. He
walked about in a coat embroidered all over,and in the drawing-rooms of
society looked just like one of those rich pearl-embroidered bell-pulls,
which are only made for show; and behind them always hangs a good thick cord
for use. This man also had a stout, useful substitute behind him, who did
duty for him, and performed all his dirty work. And there are still, even
now, these serviceable cords behind other embroidered bell-ropes. It is all
so wisely arranged, that a man may well be in a good humor.
"To-morrow evening, to meet a few friends:  no formal party." 
In the early days, after his return from Moscow, whenever Levin shuddered
and grew red, remembering the disgrace of his rejection, he would say to
himself: `This was just how I used to shudder and blush, thinking everything
utterly lost, when I was flunked in physics and did not get promoted; and
this is also how I thought myself utterly ruined after I had mismanaged that
affair of my sister's with which I had been entrusted. And yet, now that the
years have passed, I recall it and wonder that it could distress me so much.
It will be the same thing with this trouble as well. Time will go by, and I
shall not mind this either.' 
she would as lieve be tossed out as not."
