FROM:MR.CHEUNG PUI
Hang Seng Bank Ltd
Sai Wan Ho Branch 
171 Shaukiwan Road
Hong Kong.
e-mail address : cheung_pui1@hotmail.ro



Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Cheung
Pui,director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank
Ltd,Sai
Wan Ho Branch.I have a business proposal for you.

Before the U.S and Iraqi war,our client Major Fadi
Basem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business
man made a
numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a
value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand
United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity
several notice was sent to him, even during the war
early this year. Again after the war another
notification was sent and still no response came from
him. We later find out that the Major and his family
had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit
their home.

After further investigation it was also discovered
that Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin
in his official papers including the paper work of his
bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time
he was at my office that no one except me knew of his
deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four million Five
Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying
in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim
it. What bothers me most is that according to the 
laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the
funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong
Government if nobody applies to claim the
funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is
that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the
next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that you will be
able to receive his funds. 

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned
out so that we shall come out successful. I have
contacted an
attorney that will prepare the necessary documents
that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi
Basem,all that is required from you at this stage is
for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address
so that the attorney can commence his job. After you
have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also
fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the
necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor
for the transfer of the funds to an account that will
be provided by you.

There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we
are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney
will prepare all the necessary documents. Please
endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters
concerning this issue.Once the funds have been
transferred to your nominated bank account we shall
share in the ratio of 70% for me,25%for you,and 5% for
any expenses incurred during the course of the
operation. Should you be interested please send me
your full names and current residential address and I
will prefer you to reach me on the email address:
cheung_pui1@hotmail.ro

Once i get your response to co-operate,i shall provide
you with more details of this operation.

Your earliest response to this letter will be
appreciated.

Kind Regards,

Mr.Cheung Pui
