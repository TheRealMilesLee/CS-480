procedures before the deadline date of 29th July, 2005, as such funds

soon as claims process is completed. Be advised that most payments have been approved, and authorisation will only be based on your response within the next 72 working hours from now.

General Note:You are to keep all winning details away from the general 
public to avoid fraudulent claim from a third party, any breach of 
confidentiality by direct/indirect exposure of winning 
details/information will lead to an irreversible disqualification.We hope to speedily process all winnings, and remitt funds to you within 7 business days after the finalisation of claims with attached agent/foreign service 
director. 

In order to avoid unnecessary delays and complications, please include 
phone number, date of birth, reference/batch number for verification, 
in every correspondence regarding your claims processing. Furthermore, should there be any change in your address, do inform your claims agent as soon as possible.
