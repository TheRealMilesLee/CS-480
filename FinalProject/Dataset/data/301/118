"Society has long been hostile to intellectuals, suspecting them of everything from moral weakness and dangerous scepticism to communist conspiracy and venereal disease, but never has it been quite so explicit in pursuing the opposite prejudice, the moral elevation of simple-mindedness.  We North Americans find ourselves, on the brink of the third millenium, living in a high-tech society in which, paradoxically, stupidity is our brightest badge of goodness.  -- Mark Kingwell, Dreams of Millennium",
"If it was easy, the hardware people would take care of it.", "My homework was not stolen by a one-armed man.  -- Bart Simpson, writing 500 times on the board",
"She uses tired cliches like coasters... a place to rest her mind before picking it up and using it again.  -- Janet Schwind",
"If dreaming you are a muffler causes you to wake up exhausted, does dreaming that you are a wheel rim cause you to awaken still tired?",
"If you were a doggie on a chain, don't bite the mailman.  -- Dave Matthews",
"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inhibit the earth.", "Meader's Law:  Whatever happens to you, it will previously have happened to everyone you know, only more so.",
"Don't worry about avoiding temptation.  As you grow older, it starts avoiding you.  -- The Old Farmer's Almanac",
"Who is rich?  One who is happy with what he has...  -- Talmud",
