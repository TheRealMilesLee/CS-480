Attn: Sir

I am Barrister Paul Adams a Solicitor. I am the Personal Attorney to  Mr. 
Andy ,Who is a national of your country.Forgive me any embarrassement this 
mail might cause you,It's all for our own good. On the 21st of  April 2002, 
my client, his wife and their only son were involved in  a car accident 
along Accra / Kumasi express road. Unfortunately they  all lost their lives 
in the event of the accident, since then i have  made several enquiries to 
locate any of my clients extended  relatives and this has also proved 
unsuccessful.

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his  relatives 
over the Internet and our chamber of commerce, to locate  any member of his 
family but of no avail, hence I contacted you. I  contacted you to assist in 
repatriating the money and property left  behind before they get confiscated 
or declared unserviceable by the  bank where my client lodge these huge 
deposits.
Particularly, the bank where the deceased had an account valued at  US$10.4 
(ten million four hundred thousand united states Dollars).   Consequently, 
the bank issued me a notice to provide the next of kin  or have the account 
confiscated within a short time.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over  some 
years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of  kin of the 
deceased since you share the same surname so that the  proceeds of the 
account valued at U.S$10.4 million can be paid to  you for both of us to 
share the funds; 65% to me and 30% to you,  while 5% should be for expenses 
or tax as your government may  require. I have all necessary legal documents 
that can be used to  backup the claim. All I require is your honest 
cooperation to enable  us see this deal through.

I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate  arrangement that 
will protect you from any breach of the law. Please  get in touch with me 
through my e-mail to enable us discuss further.

Thanks for your kind co-operation.
Barr. Paul Adams

NOTE: THIS IS A DEAL BETWEEN TWO OF US AND ALSO NOTE THAT YOU ARE NOT 
RELATED TO HIM.
