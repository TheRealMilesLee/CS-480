Dear Vince,

As per our conversation I am attaching my resume and the job description below.  Please feel free to critique and give me some feedback on my resume, I will appreciate it immensely.  Once again I want to thank you for all the help and assistance you have given me over the last two years.  I am convinced that I couldn't have asked for or gotten a better boss than you.  It has truly been a pleasure and an honor to work for you.  Thank you for the opportunity!
