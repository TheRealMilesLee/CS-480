good day everyone

Even the best things are not equal to their fame.
The aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance.
Durability is part of what makes a great athlete.

http://offuttsd.com/s2UOU4fDw2uwRpvavpL4yEG2x/BBAbMAsAJwcLTA0y.htm

The foundations of a person are not in matter but in spirit
A sex symbol becomes a thing. I hate being a thing.
Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence.One man’s meat is another’s poison.
Oh, tenderly the haughty day Fills his blue urn with fire

Oant sjen
