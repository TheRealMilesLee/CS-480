The shooting east of you was actually southeast, mostly south of me and off
our property.  I hunted at the southeast corner of our property, 2 miles
from the front gate.  We got 1 mallard and 3 woodducks, but did not see a
big number of ducks.  The water dropped 1.5 feet from the day before and had
mostly receded completely off our property.  The mallards and woodies had
followed the water south -- that's what all the shooting was.  They really
got into them down there.  We are competely dry in the woods now.
