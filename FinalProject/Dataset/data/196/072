I plan to attend, but would like to ask Hector McLoughlin and Laura Kinningham to attend if that is ok.  My role as Net Works HR support is winding down and Hector and Laura will have the direct interface with you and your direct reports.

Robert has talked to me about possibly working in another HR role for awhile and I should know more about that today or tomorrow.
