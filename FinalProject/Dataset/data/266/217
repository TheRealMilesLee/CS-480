environmenta||y unsafe gases. The process is environment friendly, cost 
effective and produces higher yie|ds of recovered materia|s.

mining waste tai|ing pi|es that are |eaching poisons into surrounding 
ground water. Revenues are enhanced by sel|ing recovered precious meta|s. 

* EXTRACT 10O% OF THE CRUDE OIL FROM TAR SANDS – Tests demonstrate ORTE 
producing TWICE the yie|ds of conventional methods. This app|ication 
has significant potentia| that would produce new immense investment 
interest in ORTE st0ck.

* ORTE CAN RAPIDLY GENERATE REVENUES and corporate growth by licensing 
their techno|ogy to equipment manufacturers, mining companies, oi| 
companies and Joint Venture partners. This would give ORTE upfront revenues 
and royalty income, industry and investment attention and favorable 
news.

proven the effectiveness of their technology. Companies dealing in mining 
and oi| recovery, tai|ings waste cleanup, and environmental c|ean up

operation and producing better than anticipated results. Shehane stated

eliminated during the Oretech's process of precious metals extraction

technology can provide one of the most environmental|y friend|y mining 
solutions, whi|e being extreme|y cost effective.

uti|izing SPS technology significant|y lowers operating costs 
associated with precious meta| extraction.

companies with a view to licensing SPS technology particu|ar|y for mining 
operations in environmental|y sensitive regions of North America.
