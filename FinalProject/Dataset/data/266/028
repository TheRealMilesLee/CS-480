Dear All:
Sheila and I spent a weekend on the Frio River in August last summer and 
really enjoyed it. The place we stayed was run down. We have upgraded this 
year. The place we have chosen has 100 plus acres and four new and neat 
cabins. 140 a night for three night minumum. we have rented one of the four 
cabins for the weekend August 8 (thursday) to 11 (sunday). The other 3 
cabins are available.

Go check out their web site at www.friobluffcabins.com

Anyone interested? Might be alot of fun if we booked up the place to cool 
off in August.
FYI lots of fun tubing and shooting whitewings with your finger gun while 
anticipating opening dove season around the corner.

e.
