From=3ATakura Makoni
I am Takura=2C Simba Makoni's son=3B I'm a student at the University of Cape Town 
in South Africa where my two brothers and I were schooling=3B In line with the 
prevailing festive seasons=2C I feel it is not out of order to wish you and 
yours a happy festive season and God's blessings and abundance in this 
year=2E
My younger brother was was pushed in front of an oncoming train that crushed 
the life out of his young body=2E
We know he was murdered because my other brother and I have also had attempts 
made on our lives twice now and we have told our father about it=2E
Kindly allow me digress a little bit=2C I am not telling you all of this to 
scare you please=2C I made my mind over and decided to write to you after 
having given much thought to our situation=3B My Father Dr=2E Simba 
Makoni=2C was the former Minister of Finance and Economic Development in 
Zimbabwe under the Government of Mugabe=2C his so called policies were not too 
popular with the other zombie-like cronies of our so-called president who 
openly questioned his loyalty to Mugabe=2E That was when the problems all 
started=2C he got death threats from people we did not know but suspected to be 
party loyalists=2C his car was burnt on one occasion when we were on a visit in 
Zimbabwe last year=2E The police did not even bother trying to investigate the 
matter=3B Mugabe finally removed him for openly and honestly declaring to the 
world that Zimbabwe faced a major and crippling food crisis at the height of 
the state-sponsored illegal land invasions=2E
My younger brother varnished from our flat in Cape Town one afternoon and his 
body was found drugged and battered and all through his life he never smoked 
a stick of cigarette=2C not even a stimulant=2E It was obvious that die-hard 
supporters of Mugabe murdered him to spite or break my father's spirit=2C for 
my father loved him the most like we did=2E
This brings me back to why I write you=3B I write to solicit for your help=2E My 
father was a successful businessman before he was called to serve in Mugabe's 
cabinet and he had business interests all over Africa=2C over here in South 
Africa our family has US$14=2E7 Million held in trust on our behalf by a Holden 
Agency=2C this was made possible by our father years ago with the help of his 
advisor who runs a finance company based here in South Africa=2E 
According to my father=2C the deposit was not made in his name but in the name 
of a company that was registered by him and leaving room for another partner 
with 82% controlling shares in the business=3B then the business was registered 
both in South Africa and in Zimbabwe=2C so that no one can claim that he was 
the owner of the money=2E My father cannot travel down to South Africa as he is 
being watched by agents of the state back home=2C he consulted with his advisor 
who is in South Africa and came up with this idea to help claim the funds and 
ferry my brother and I out of South Africa to a place of relative safety like 
the United States or England where we can continue with either schooling or 
working=2E
If you decide to assist us=2C you will be required to discuss with us on 
Tel=2FFax=3A+27 73-599-3635=3B we has been authorized by our father to 
open discussions with you if you signify your interest in assisting us=2E 
I can also be contacted on makoniaa=40yahoo=2Eco=2Euk
Currently=2C my brother and I are living in South Africa and after deliberating 
with our father=2C he sees no need for us to return to Zimbabwe=2E
Please note that by your offering to assist us we will on your contacting us 
by phone or Fax=2C discuss a suitable compensation for you and also I would 
like to mention too that this transaction must be conducted within a legal 
framework as we have our father's good name to protect and another major 
thing I demand from you is an honest answer if you have handled any 
transaction of this kind of magnitude before and assurance from you that our 
family has your complete trust and assurance that the funds will be safe once 
transferred to your account=2E
We thought that the recent elections in Zimbabwe would maybe oust Mugabe and 
give us new hope to go back=2C but the outcome of it has left us with a 
stronger resolve NEVER to go back to Zimbabwe again=2E
So you see that we are really in dire need of assistance to begin our lives 
anywhere away from Zimbabwe=2E

Please assist us=2E

Yours Sincerely=2C


Takura Makoni=2E
