Prior to 7/99  this was ENA not HPL, but there may be some issues on it as well for 3/99 to 6/99.  The deal ticket we used was 62717.  I will have to look further into the ENA activity because I know we still have some invoices that were paid under one company and we still have drafts under the other.

This ticket starts with 7/99 production.  How were all of the other months paid?

Daren, 

I am trying to get some payments out to Williams for old months 11/2000 and 1/2001 but global counterparty said this deal should have Black Marlin Pipeline Company Inc. instead of Black Marlin Pipeline Company effective 3/99.  The Black Marlin Pipeline Company was for an internal record (when it was an Enron entity).
