Davette,

We need to credit Barry Tycholiz (P # 564185) with 40 hrs extra vacation time.  His offer letter said that he would receive an additional 40 hrs vacation.  He has not yet been credited with the extra hrs.  He should be receiving a total of 160 hrs vacation.  Please let me know when this has been completed.

Thanks,
Ben
