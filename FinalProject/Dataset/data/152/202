Nope.  Loretta is straddling the fence.  Duque and Bilas are opposed. Brown
hasn't a real clue.  Davis isn't sure.  Sempra doesn't care because the MOU
is more important.  SoCalGas can't lobby.  Might just get voted out....

> Commissioner Wood's alternate rejects the Comprehensive Settlement

system,
> and approves the Interim Settlement proposal, which would make minor
> changes to SoCalGas' windowing procedures, establish hector Road as an
> alternate receipt point, and establish pools for gas trading, among
other

> rejecting the unbundling of core interstate transportation from rates
and
> eliminating completely the core's contribution to ITCS (interstate
> transportation cost surcharges), which cost the core approximately
$7-10
> Million per year.

> I'll forward a copy of the alternate to you as soon as it is
available.
