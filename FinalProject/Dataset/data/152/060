Alan, you bet, on the west-wide cap we just need to keep a close watch on FERC issuances.

On the CA case, depositions are happening this week and early next week.  Notwithstanding, I will schedule a call as soon as practicable.  There is a window of opportunity today, except for 1-3 pm eastern time.  Could Tim and perhaps Jeff Richter be available?  We have a question for Jeff related to our accounting for block forward transactions.

Ray,

Tim reiterated in a call today that he would like to get briefed on the litigation and also would like any intelligence on when FERC's going to revise the WSCC-wide cap.

Regarding the latter, I assume we keep the radar up for an order from the FERC.  I expect it any day now.

Regarding the former, can you set up a meeting either late this week or early next?

Alan

Ray --

Let' s hold a call in early Dec (I don't need to be on the call) where we go through the FERC case for Belden.  Give me a call to discuss.

Jim
