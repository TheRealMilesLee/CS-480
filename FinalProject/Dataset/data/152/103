Yes, I will be calling Martin and Kevin today.
I think it's best to keep it as close to the vest as possible.  I don't want
to upset anyone
and certainly all are being considered.  The next time anyone asks anything,
please
feel free to suggest to them that they call me directly.

Thanks a lot.

Audrey,

Martin, Jason, and Kevin were asking the status on the Sempra deal.  Are
you going to call them and discuss what is going on?  I am not sure what
to say.
