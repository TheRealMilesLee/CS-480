I need to check on their 3rd party debt.  I'll get back to you later today.

However, since the entity is set up as a division of Atmos Energy Corp, do we legally have a master contract with Atmos Energy Corp as well??  Greeley's exposure rolls up under Atmos Energy at the end of the day and they transact under both names.  Also, have we verified that Greeley Gas Company, a division of Atmos Energy Corp is actually a valid legal entity??

Let me know, please.

Thanks--Veronica
