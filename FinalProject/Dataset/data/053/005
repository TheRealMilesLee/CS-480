This is the language that I referred to in my email.  I have sent this to Brad and Greg as well.  I have been working with Brad to refine the language in a way that gives them the least amount of heartburn.

Let me know what you think.

Lisa

Linda  - Here is the draft changes to the Bingaman electricity bill for your discussion with Louise.  They draw from Ken Raisler's comments and Lisa's review.  Houston would prefer to have the language deleted, which John reports is highley unlikely.  John also reports that the changes should be simple and clean - we think these meet that criterea.
