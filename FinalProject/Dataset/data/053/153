Dear Amazon.com Customer,

What's an Amazoniversary? Two years ago this month, you placed your
very first order (using this e-mail address) with Amazon.com. To
extend our thanks--and show you how much growing we've done--we're
inviting you back with $10 off your next order of $50 or more.

http://www.amazon.com/sept-amazoniversary/

So celebrate any way you like: with a bestselling book, a new 
DVD release, or a CD player--it's up to you. But be sure to take
advantage of this exclusive $10 savings before it expires on
September 30.  (See details below.)

We look forward to all your Amazoniversaries to come!

David Risher
Senior VP and Amazon Customer of 5 Years (and Counting)
