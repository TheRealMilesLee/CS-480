Hello, My name is Hakeem Ogunbunmi, I work in Volume Management. Gloria Barkowsky and I are currently working on a project to properly identify Enron's responsibility regarding how fuel should be treated on Agency contracts. i.e. is Enron responsible for the fuel or not?  Using various sources, we have been able to identify most of these. The items highlighted in red on the attachment are those  that we still need some help on.

If you folks will be kind enough to take a look at these and let us know what information you have, we will greatly appreciate it.
 
Thanks
