Dear friend
Assalam U Alaikum,

I am amina Usman from Libya.I am married to Late Mallam Aminu USMAN of bl=
essed
memory who is an oil explorer in Libya and Kuwait for twelve years before=

he died in the year 2000.We were married for twelve years without a child=
.He
died after abrief illnes
s that lasted for only four days.Before his death we were both devoted Mu=
slims.Since
his death I too have been battling with both Cancer and fibroid problems.=

When my late Husband was alive he deposited the sum of $9.5million (Nine
Million, Five Hundred
thousand U.S Dollars) with a Finance Company in oversea. Recently,my doct=
or
told me that I have only six months to live due to cancer problem. Though=

what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness.Having known my condition I
decided to donate this fund toei
ther a Muslem organization or devoted Muslim individual that will utilize=

this money the way I am going to instructs herein.

I want this Muslim organization or individual to use this money in all si=
ncerity
to fund mosques, orphanages, widows, and also propagating the word of ALL=
AH
and to ensure that the society upholdsthe views and belief of the Holy Qu=
ran.
The Holy Quran emph
asizes so much on ALLAH'S benevolence and this has encourage me to take
the bold step.I took this decision because I don't have any child that wi=
ll
inherit this money and my husband relatives are new Christian's converts
and I don't want a situation wher
e this money will be used in an Unholy manner.Hence the reasons for this
bold ecision. I know that after death I will be with ALLAH the most benef=
icent
and themost merciful.

I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my
health, because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me alway=
s.
I don't want them to know about this development. With ALLAH all things
are possible.

As soon as I receive your reply on Email:(aminausman@zwallet.com) I shall=

give you the country in oversea where the money was deposited. I will als=
o
issue a letter of authority to the Finance Company authorizing them that
the said fund Have being willed
to you and a copy of such authorization will be
forwarded to you. I want you and the Muslim community where you reside to=

always pray for me.

My happiness is that I lived a true devoted Muslims worthy of emulation.
Whoever that wants to serve ALLAH must serve him in truth and in fairness=
.

Please always be prayerful all through your life.Any delay in your reply
will give room in sourcing for a Muslim organization or a devoted Muslim
for this same purpose. Until I hear from you, my dreams will rest squarel=
y
on your shoulders.May theAlmighty
ALLAH continue to guide and protect you.

amina Usman,
