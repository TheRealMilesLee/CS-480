Greetings from:

Dear Friend, 
 
Since January 1st, I've received a surprising number of e-mails 
and phone calls from customers and subscribers who want my 
advice about starting an Internet business. 
 
It seems quite a few of you made a New Year's resolution to 
start (or grow) an Internet business in 2005 ;-) !!! 
 
So if that's you, I suggest you read this e-mail. 
 
Because while I'm an experienced online marketer now (2004 was 
my most successful year to date, Wahoo!), I think you should 
learn from the guy who taught ME how to be successful online... 
 
And the guy I'm referring to is Corey Rudl... 
 
Corey has made over $40 Million (yes! that's $40,000,000) in 
online sales -- and his web sites get over 1.8 million 
visitors every month! 
 
But I have to say, what I respect MOST about this guy is that 
he can teach ANYONE how to generate wealth using the Internet... 
 
I don't care who you are, or what your background is! 
 
I've seen Corey teach complete "newbies" with no budget how to 
make $100,000-$500,000 per year, working just a few hours per 
week on their web sites... 
 
And I've seen him teach experienced business people how to 
snowball their existing Internet income into literally 
MILLIONS of dollars! 
 
So if you are thinking about starting an Internet business this 
year, I highly recommend you check out his #1 best-selling 
Internet marketing course. It's at: 
 http://secure.linkshield.com/?c=401&l=13

It's literally the "bible" of Internet marketing, and it 
includes everything you need to be wildly successful online, 
from A-Z. 
 
Plus, to kick off the New Year, Corey's giving away $957 worth 
of free traffic, software, eBooks, and more -- all for starting 
your business and increasing your online sales. 
 
Like I said, this is who I recommend because I've used Corey's 
information and secrets with a lot of success and I know you're 
going to get a ton of value out of his stuff too.
 
Hope you enjoy it! 
 
Hal M Harding
 
P.S. Just so you know, Corey's only giving away this $957 
bonus package for the next 3 days, so if you wait, you'll miss 
out! It even includes over $85 worth of FREE pay-per-click 
traffic for your web site... so at least check it out for that! 
Again, it's at http://secure.linkshield.com/?c=401&l=13
 
Until next time:
Here's my hand to your success,
 
Hal M Harding
