TJ,

Let me let you in on a little secret my man -- you ain't gettin' no break
from the Luke man when 2 pops out, nor are you getting a break from Luke
and/or Daniel Jr. when no 3 is born. There are no breaks to be had in the
parenting arena for about 20 years.

Point 2 -- It pains me so to make this statement, but Stamas might actually
be able to beat me in basketball now since I have no cartilage in my left
knee. The Dr. says that my running days are over (which was obviously a
serious blow to my lifestyle), but more importantly, he said that my
organized hoop days are history too. This is not to say that I can't
contribute the next time that we conduct a demonstration of our skills while
hung over at the Charlotte "Y", but it ain't looking good for me ever
swatting Stamas' ugly jumper into that pretty boy face of his ever again.
Then again, I'm crippled, not dead. Certainly elevation is not required to
stuff him so ... maybe I will.

Go Sooners!

Sweets
