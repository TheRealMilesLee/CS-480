Can you tell me if he was on the term list and did he receive the $4,500?  If so, I assume you plan to take this amount out of an upcoming paycheck.  thanks
Please copy Stacey White with the access reinstatement confirmation.  thanks

Israel Estrada should be on a list to retain, but his badge and IT access was cut off last Friday.  He apparently still did not have access today, but is out of the office.

Can you please verify you have him on a retain list, make sure he did not get a term packet and $4,500 and also get his access reinstated.  thanks
