Another person to keep a eye on.
White male 6 ft  165 lbs. light brown hair, not a bad looking person.
He came into my building while i was inside working and gave me the story
that he was looking for work. He had to walk through a closed gated to
get inside.
i raised a shovel and informed him that he was trespassing.
this was Sunday. i just saw him again at 1pm walking north on Taft.
In my opinion this guy is up to no good. Keep your eyes open.
