Cindy,
The silver lining for your former employees is several companies are
interested in Houston relocations or expansions because of your highly
qualified workforce.  Could we get a matrix of the job titles and
quantities of former employees that were recently terminated?  I tried
logging onto the careerservices.enron.com site, but couldn't get access
to resumes.

We have a relocation prospect visiting Houston from NY on Thursday
evening.  They want to talk to a large employer.  I thought this might
be an opportunity for you to present both sides of the equation.  You
are still a significant Houston employer AND you have a significant
number of highly qualified former employees who would be excellent
employees for this organization.  I know this is short notice, but I
just found out.

On another note, on Thursday I spoke with an executive recruiter who had
spoken with 60 former Enron employees that day, and all were already
re-employed.  Thought you could use a bit of good news.

Thanks Cindy!
