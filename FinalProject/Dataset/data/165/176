A large group of Taliban soldiers are moving down a road when they hear a
voice call from behind a sand dune.

"One Texas soldier is better than ten Taliban."

The Taliban commander quickly sends 10 of his best soldiers over the dune
whereupon a gun battle breaks out and continues for a few minutes, then
silence.

The voice then calls out "One Texan is better than one hundred Taliban."

Furious, the Taliban commander sends his next best 100 troops over the dune
and instantly a huge gunfight commences. After 10 minutes of battle, again
silence.

The Texan voice calls out again "One Texan is better than one thousand
Taliban."

The enraged Taliban Commander musters one thousand fighters and sends them
across the dune. Cannon, rocket and machine gun fire ring out as a huge
battle is fought. Then silence. Eventually one wounded Taliban fighter
crawls back over the dune and with his dying words tells his commander,
"Don't send any more men, its a trap. There's two of them."
