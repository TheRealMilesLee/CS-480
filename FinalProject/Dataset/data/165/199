ENA is the agent on Eastern New Mexico's oba contract 25190.  The balance as of 11/30/01 is $47,610.18 due TW.

The contract does not have an associated nomination in December.  We are delivering approximately 500 mmbtus/day to
POI 13199 - the Eastern New Mexico Roosevelt point.  

Amy - please make contact(if you haven't yet) with Eastern New Mexico to see if they are going to be purchasing gas during December.  Also, make them aware that they are ultimately responsible for their oba balance.  ENA is still identified as the agent on this contract but .......?

In order to prevent this imbalance from growing, Eastern New Mexico needs to have someone schedule gas to their point.
