starts at 5 pm.  we'll have folks to our house around 2 pm.  can you guys hang out on your own before then?  i hadn't realized the game was going to be in the evening.  altho, we'd love to get together with you the night before, if you decided not to fly in until the morning of the 3rd, i would understand that.
