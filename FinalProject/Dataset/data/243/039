Ahh hah,  I may be able to run up there and view this thing-----any idea on a starting price???
Joe, you have proved your proficiency with scanning in pics of late,  how 'bout sending over that trailer pic.
E, do you have a receiver ball for a draw-tite? ...just in case.  Does anyone have spare room in their attic to store this trailer??

chad, joe has more info on this. But, as i understand it, Kim had info 
regarding police siezed goods which happen to include this here trailer, 
which has been described as 6x10 and in pretty good condition. apparently 
someone is going to have access to a picture of it sometime today.

then there will be this auction thing tomarrow described below. Perhaps it 
is an opportunity to get us a fire sale deal on a trailer for our cart. e.
