Sara,

We are beginning the process of contacting each of the 31 "Live" and "Performing" counterparts.  Prior to contacting them, Louis and I would like your perspective on any points that need to be discussed (or areas to avoid).  

Hopefully, we could get together today if it works with your schedule.

Mike Bridges
