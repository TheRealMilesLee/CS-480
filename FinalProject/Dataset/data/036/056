<p dir="ltr"><b>Dear eBay Member, </b><br>
<br>
Due to recent account takeovers and unauthorized listings, eBay is introducing a 
new account verification method. From time to time, randomly selected accounts 
(seller and/or buyer) are subjected to an advanced verification process based on 
our merchant accounts/bank relations and customers credit card. eBay may also 
request in an email message scanned/faxed copies of one or more photo ID's. Your 
account confirmation may go wrong if your credit card/bank account is expired, 
or if you have changed your credit card number, billing address etc. without 
notifying us about the change. Subject of this verification process are also the 
accounts that have unpaid dues to eBay. <br>
Your account is not suspended, but if in 48 hours after you receive this message 
your account is not confirmed we reserve the right to suspend your eBay 
registration. If you received this notice and you are not the authorized account 
holder, please be aware that it is in violation of eBay policy to represent 
oneself as another eBay user. Such action may also be in violation of local, 
national, and/or international law. eBay is committed to assist law enforcement 
with any inquires related to attempts to misappropriate personal information 
with the intent to commit fraud or theft. Information will be provided at the 
request of law enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators are prosecuted 
to the full extent of the law. <br>
<br>
Note: If this is the second time you receive this notice, it might be because 
you have made a mistake when you entered your details or that the account was 
not updated at all. <br>
