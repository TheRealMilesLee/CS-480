	This is a reminder that the Summer 2001 ISO Demand Relief Program
charges are reflected on the June 30 statements and June invoices.  As
announced previously this year, the ISO has developed a Summer 2001 Demand
Relief Program (DRP).   The program is designed to provide an additional
level of demand reduction on the ISO system that can be implemented during a
stage 2 Emergency in an effort to prevent involuntary load curtailments or
rotating blackouts associated with a Stage 3 Emergency.  

	Similar to last years program, the same charge types are utilized
for capacity, Charge Type 7 and 117, described in the first link below.  Two
new Charge Types, 3472 and 3482,  have been created for the energy payment
and allocation when contracted loads are called upon to curtail, described
in the second link below.  Although the program was initiated in June, no
calls were made to curtail load, therefore, charges 3472 and 3482 were not
utilized.    The periods in which the Demand Relief Program was called upon
to initiate interruptions of contracted loads can be found at the third link
below.
