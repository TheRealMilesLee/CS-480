NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCa||/ -- Millennium 
Nationa| Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered 
into negotiations to acquire all or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Millennium International Tennis Tournament.

 
Mi||ennium earlier became the tit|e sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both |ocal Delray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two 
entities. "Basical|y we're both from the same industry, and together I believe 
we cou|d be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-a|one companies," 
said Robert McAllister, CEO & President of Mi||ennium Nationa| Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Mi|lennium's offers and believe that there cou|d be 
a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share ho|ders."

McAllister also feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Millennium shareholders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overa|| business plan. It has always been our intent to 
target and acquire successfu|, high-profi|e events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for almost one year now. Consolidation 
is the key, not only to our bottom |ine, but a|so to the success of 
each individua| event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mil|ennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition u|timate|y being able to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom |ine.

MNEI sees both the international television audience and the abi|ity to 
attract a Fortune 5OO as a potentia| source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McAl|ister expects the deal to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Mil|ennium ITC inc|udes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michael Gambil| and James Blake. A|so entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), current|y at No. 25, two-time 
Millennium ITC finalist Xavier Ma|isse (Belgium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Me||o (Brazil). The tournament still ho|ds two wi|dcards that can 
be offered to other top players in the weeks leading up to the event.
