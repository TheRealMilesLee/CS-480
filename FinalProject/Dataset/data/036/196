The ISO is experiencing increasing loading on the Pittsburg-Tassaraja 230kV
line and requires additional decremental energy bids on the north side of
the path and incremental energy bids on the south side of the path.  To the
extent that Scheduling Coordinators do not respond with sufficient energy
bids to mitigate the anticipated congestion, the ISO may invoke the other
steps of the Intra-Zonal Congestion Management Procedure.  Sent by Market
Operations.

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change.  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current,
accurate information available in preparing this notice, system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice.
