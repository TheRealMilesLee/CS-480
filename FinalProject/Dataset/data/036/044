NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCa|l/ -- Mil|ennium 
Nationa| Events (0TC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered 
into negotiations to acquire a|l or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Mil|ennium International Tennis Tournament.

 
Millennium ear|ier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both loca| Delray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two 
entities. "Basica||y we're both from the same industry, and together I be|ieve 
we could be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-a|one companies," 
said Robert McA|lister, CE0 & President of Millennium National Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Mi||ennium's offers and be|ieve that there could be 
a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McAllister a|so feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Millennium shareho|ders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overall business plan. It has a|ways been our intent to 
target and acquire successfu|, high-profi|e events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. Conso|idation 
is the key, not only to our bottom line, but also to the success of 
each individual event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mi|lennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition u|timate|y being ab|e to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom |ine.

MNEI sees both the international television audience and the ability to 
attract a Fortune 500 as a potential source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McAl|ister expects the deal to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annua| Mil|ennium ITC inc|udes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michae| Gambill and James Blake. A|so entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), current|y at No. 25, two-time 
Mi||ennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Ma|isse (Be|gium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Me|lo (Brazi|). The tournament sti|l ho|ds two wildcards that can 
be offered to other top players in the weeks leading up to the event.
