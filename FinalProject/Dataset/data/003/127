Dear Mark and Tana,
After reviewing the password applications available on the Clickpaper and EnronOnline websites it appears that several countries have access to EOL but not to Clickpaper (please see attached).    Since due dilligence has already been completed for the EOL countries and soon Clickpaper will migrate to the EnronOnline trading platform, it seems it might not be too difficult to add mirroring Clickpaper password applications.  Is that the case?  We have business interests in several of the countries accessible solely via EOL.
Best regards,
Marla Thompson
