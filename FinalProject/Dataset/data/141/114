Thanks, I pass it on to Chris.

I haven't heard back on Lodi. I'll check.

McCrae said the issue has slowed down due to our comments and some CPUC
actions.  Bottorff doesn't know when it will happen, but Tom and I will make
sure you're included.  McCrae wants to see a proposal on the exit fee.  I'll
make sure you get one.

On the GRC, the Commission issued an Order to Show Cause today for us AND
Edison on the failure to file and NOI.  I sent a note to Florio saying we
may need him as a witness on feasibility, that even though he thought our
GRC filings looked like they'd been put together in 20 days, ...

Take care.

Dan

Greetings Dan:  Few things.

*	Chris Warner did an extremely good job of talking about your
plan at DJ's thing in Yountville.
*	Thanks a million for helping to identify someone who's a bit
more "outside the box" to help on the Lodi power plant/gas storage deal.
Any indication of who that person might be? We're anxious to start
meeting with them.
*	Any word on getting a conference call together with the large
customers?
*	Finally, have you told the PUC yet that you won't be filing any
stinking GRC?  If so, how have they reacted?

Have a great holiday weekend.

Best,
Jeff
