How will hundreds of Houston's young singles celebrate Christmas this holiday 
season? The SingleLife Christmas Party on Thursday, December 13th from

downtown Houston is filled with tinsel and cheer for this annual semi-formal 
event. Hors de oeuvres, music, merry people and incredible door prizes- 
promise to make this party a smash hit.  
Tickets are now available for only $25 until Dec.1st; $35 until Dec.13th
