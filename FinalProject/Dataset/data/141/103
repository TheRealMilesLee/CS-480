Minor changes included....

There was no recognizable change in the number of counterparties.  While we do not identify our counterparties, no one significant has dropped off.  Our transaction volume remains within the normal range, given normal daily and counterparty variability.  The 30-day rolling average for EnronOnline is more than 5,500 transactions with a notional value of more than $2.7 billion.  

While trading volumes in our core natural gas and power business have held steady, as reported in the 10Q, there has been some decrease in wholesale trading volumes in a few of our non-core businesses.  Additionally, due to the unusual events of the last few weeks, we have seen some decrease in the number of long-term transactions.  However, long-term deals are often completed off-line and do not appear in EnronOnline numbers).
