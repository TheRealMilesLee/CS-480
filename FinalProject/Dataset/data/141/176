Hello,

My name is Mr. Han, Chief Credit Officer (CCO), of an international 
finance company in shanghai, China.
What I have may be of interest to you. It is a business proposal that 
will be beneficial to  both of us.
I have been working in this bank for the past 17 years till I rose to 
my present position of Chief Accounts Officer.
I will give you my contact details on your reply to this letter.
My aim of contacting you is to solicit your cooperation and assistance 
in executing this business deal in respect of one of the accounts 
under my management valued $8,000,000.00, which has remained dormant 
for the past 15 years.
This account was owned by late Mrs. Belinda Dan and following 
investigation, we confirmed that she died in may 1991 in a car crash 
and left no children, relations or next of kin.
From past experiences and my personal relationship with the late Mrs. 
Dan, I know that no one will ever come forward to claim the funds. I 
am therefore seeking your assistance to claim the fund.
I, in conjunction with a colleague (the Chief Operating Officer) in 
the bank now seek your permission to allow an attorney prepare a 
backdated WILL in your name, so that the funds would be released to 
you as the new owner (on behalf of you, me and my colleague). 
We are writing you because, as public servants, we cannot operate a 
foreign account.
Consequently, I will present you as the owner of the funds so you will 
be able to claim the fund with the help of an attorney. This is 
simple. I will like you to provide immediately your:
1.Full names in 1990
2.Contact address in 1990
3.Phone/Fax numbers
With the above info, an Attorney will prepare the necessary legal 
documents to back up the  transfer of the fund to you as the new 
beneficiary. It will then be released to you, for us to split. The 
Attorney will do all the paperwork and this will guarantee everything.
Send your response to:  penglee@echina.com
Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and 
further explanation that will help you understand.
Note also that we shall require your assistance to invest our share in 
your country. (Buying of properties like houses, hotels etc).
Please treat as confidential and urgent.
Regards.
Han.
