Subject: 


Dave and I wanted to inform you and IEP of the recent merger between
Edson + Modisette and another highly reputable Sacramento
consulting/advocacy firm, Public Policy Advocates.  

As you well know, Edson + Modisette has experienced some major changes
this year, with the retirement of Karen Edson and the departure of one
of our long-time consultants, Cece Martin.  These changes also created a
new opportunity for us to partner with others that can improve our
capabilities.

The merger has given Dave and I and our clients the ability to draw upon
additional people, many with valuable skills, and additional resources.
Public Policy Advocates is a long-standing firm in Sacramento, founded
and headed by Fred Taugher, who among other things was the Director of
the Assembly Rules Committee for many years and come this January
celebrates 40 years of experience in public policy.  Fred gives us a new
dimension of political access and strength we have never had before.
There are also three other advocates in the firm that IEP could call
upon if needed:  Amy Zajac and Steve Cruz who each have ten years of
experience in the Capitol, and Jennifer Wada who cut her teeth in public
policy arena during this year's energy crisis.  There will also be
additional support staff, and other resources that we can draw upon.

What hasn't changed is my concentration on energy issues both in the
Legislative and regulatory arenas.  

Public Policy Advocates has a long client list which, if you are
interested, you can see on the Secretary of State's web site at

http://cal-access.ss.ca.gov/lobbyist/detail_firm.asp?ID=1147315&SESSION=
2001

Although our old phone numbers and addresses will work until the end of
the year, our new contact information is the following:

Public Policy Advocates
Dave Modisette - Vice President
Julee Malinowski-Ball, Senior Associate
1015 K Street
Sacramento CA 95814
916-441-0702
FAX-441-3549
dave@ppallc.com
julee@ppallc.com

In short, I believe the merger of Edson + Modisette and PPA will have
significant benefits, in terms of influence, and access, and
availability of additional resources.  

As IEP contemplates its agenda for the second half of the legislative
session, I greatly hope you include our new team in your plans. 

Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me.
