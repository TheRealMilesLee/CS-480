   Word of the Day for Monday February 25, 2002:

   tyro \TY-roh\, noun:
   A beginner in learning; a novice.

     It's  difficult  to  imagine  a  tyro  publishing a book on
     medical procedures or economic theory.
     --Philip  Zaleski,  "God Help the Spiritual Writer," [1]New
     York Times, January 10, 1999

     He  was  a  sensitive,  fine soul alert to the pleasures of
     being  green,  a  tyro,  an amateur, unwilling to close his
     mind before it had been tempted.
     --Paul West, Sporting With Amaryllis

     And,   though   we  were  mere  tyros,  beginners,  utterly
     insignificant,  he  was  invariably as kind and considerate
     and  thoughtful,  and as lavish in the gift of his time, as
     though he had nothing else to do.
     --Leonard  Warren,  Joseph  Leidy:  The  Last  Man Who Knew
     Everything
     _________________________________________________________

   Tyro  is  from Latin tiro, "a young soldier, a recruit," hence
   "a beginner, a learner."
