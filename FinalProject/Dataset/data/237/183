Jane -

You'll have a more traditional "thank you" note coming shortly, but I wanted
to drop you a line to say how much Kim and I enjoyed the cuisine, the
company, the conversation and the cordials (if we'd have smoked cigars, it
would have been 5-for-5).  Richard and Judy were delightful, and you and
Barry the consummate hosts.  Your home is even lovelier than before.

Thanks for including us and we look forward to our next outing with the
Hills!

Take care,
John
