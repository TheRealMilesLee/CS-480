Gerald,
 
Eric, in structuring, has this question on the wording of the Kennedy Amendment.  I told him you "the master of wording" was ok with it.  What do you think?

Paul,
The language regarding the volumes still has the phrase " up to" implying the customer may own some put rights. Can we remove that language and just say 10,000 MMBtu/d, etc?
