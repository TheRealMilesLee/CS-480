I am finalizing the documentation for Jeff's signature now.  The resolution (Jeff does not sign) will have to follow.

Please provide me with the contact information so that I can forward the documents to CSFB (phone, fax and courier delivery address).

Marie

Sara,

Jeff Kinneman has suggested that perhaps legal could scan the executed document and edit the signature pages as opposed to recreate it since CSFB cannot provide the word document we requested.

However we decide to pursue this is still a priority as we are now shut off from trading.

Please advise as to what time frame we can expect the document to be completed.

Thanks,

Tom
