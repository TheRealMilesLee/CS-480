Dear Monika,

When you download the utipulp' s statistics, you always get the historical
statistics. In order to look at the historical you have just to let appear
the masked
lines.
Best regards

Maryline

Thank you for letting me know.
Also, do you have historical data for Utipulp: Consumption, inventory
and days of supply?

Can you please help me find these?

thanks again,
Monika Causholli

Dear Monika,

We usually send every month Utipulp statistics figures by email, but our
association decided during the last meeting not to diffused them by
email in
the future, only to put on our website : www.utipulp.org. That 's mean
that
you will not receive email anymore but you can download directly the
current
statistics on the website near the 15th of each month.

Best regards,

Mrs BAERTSOEN
