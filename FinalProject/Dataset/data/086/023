Thanks for the very kind thoughts. We enjoyed having you with us for a
few weeks and learned much from you as well. You're a very talented
individual and were there more people like you, the Italian market
would, I'm sure, work better than is likely to be the case. I consider
myself fortunate to have gotten to spend time with you and am confident
our paths will cross again soon....Rick

Dear Rick,
 I understand that this is a very sad time for You (and for us) all and
I
imagine that there can't be only work to talk about; however I want to
thank
You all for the attentions You paid to me; I had a big chance to
understand
(of course broadly) your business as a trader; what I learned will help
me
greatly in managing the task of I'm facing in my position here at the
Acquirente Unico.
I really appreciate your hospitality; I knew Enron was the best company
in
energy trading, but now I'm impressed in finding out that the Enron
people
are not only skilled and cleaver but so kind and friendly too. I want
You to
know that Vinio (he is a very good guy, and I'm so happy I met him),
Alfredo
(words are not needed about Alfredo), Ginger especially (You're very
lucky
having an assistant as Ginger, but what about the luck of them all in
having
a boss like You are?) and, needless to say, everybody made me understand
why
Enron is one of the best company to work for.

I'm looking forward to see You in Italy

Best regards

Federico
