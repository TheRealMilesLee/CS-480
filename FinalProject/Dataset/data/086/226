We have asked Jerry  Halverson for an alternate, if Stan is unavailable.  Vicky Bailey will  speak about DOE expectations and concerns.  Glynn Blanton will address  expectations and concerns from a state perspective.

 Deliverables:
Persons viewing this Special  Program will have a better understanding of the following:
Can the industry effectively secure the massive  infrastructure within the United States?   If we cannot, what methodology do we utilize to determine and address  our greatest risks?
What is the REAL threat to the gas  infrastructure?  Do we understand  what companies are trying to protect against?
How to effectively evaluate your current system  security.
Proactive steps in creating alliances with homeland  security, law enforcement and trade associations
Our 'new normal' will not be like the last…but what is  the proper level of awareness we should have?  Should we look to foreign companies as  our 'new normal' what may already be their standard operating  procedures?
We may need to sacrifice "convenience" for the benefit  of better security, but what does that mean?  
To increase security we will need to share less system  information as widely…what information should we begin to hold more  closely?

 The broadcast will be aired in three segments.  Each segment will follow the  model:
 Preparedness, Prevention,  Protection, Response & Recovery
