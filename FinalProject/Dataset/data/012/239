Gerald, we recently placed a $50,000 bond for HPL for Franchise Tax Certification for you.  

I understand from our broker, John L. Wortham that our surety, St. Paul/Seaboard Fire & Marine was informed that Marsh USA will be handling the HPL bonds effective 06-01-01 (please see attached email).

I am attaching a list of outstanding bonds that HPL has in place.   Should these bonds be canceled? Or if these bonds are still required, you may wish to consider placing with your new agent of record, Marsh USA.  They can either be replaced all at once or just prior to expiration. 

Please note while most of the bonds were placed with St. Paul/Seaboard Fire & Marine there are a couple that were placed with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company.   

Please let me know how you wish to handle the outstanding bonds.. Thanks.  

If you have questions, please give me a call 713 853-5687.

Mary, we have received information from Roger Bumgarner at St. Paul/Seaboard that Marsh USA has been appointed agent of record effective June 1, 2001 on the HPL bonds he writes.

As you know, there are three bonds with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and two through Insurance Company of North America.  I presume we will  be receiving notice that Marsh has been appointed on them, also.   However, we have not yet received information to that effect.
