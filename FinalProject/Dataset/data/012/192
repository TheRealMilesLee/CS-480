Attn:
Dear,

I am BARRISTER Fred Williams, personal Attorney to the late FORREST STEPHEN DeMARTINO  of&nbsp; , California, A national of your country, My late client&nbsp; was involved in an {AIR CRASH} that occurred on Jan Thursday 9th 2003  With an air craft  {US Airways Express Flight 5481 } which crashed Wednesday at Charlotte/Douglas International Airport, killing all 21 aboard passengers were involved as you  can confirm from the website below:
{http://www.thestate.com/mld/state/4904572.htm }

I got your contact through the help of my sister-in-law that works with 
the American Chambers of Commerce and Tourism, due I did not disclose 
to her my humble intention for an honest foreigner like you, Having 
noted the confidence reposed on your person by the sponsor of the 
recommendation, My late client was as well a one time secret Agent in 
transferring of money overseas for the late head of state of Nigeria {GENERAL 
SANI ABACHA }. 
Before his death On  Jan Thursday 9th 2003  , My client Deposited the 
total sum of US$20,000,000.00 { TWENTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS } In 
{IMPERIAL BANKING CORPRATION} hoping of transferring the fund to his country as soon 
as he comes back from conference.

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his name 
over the Internet, to locate any member of his family. I have contacted 
you to assist in repatriating the money and properties left behind by 
my client before he get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the 
Bank where this huge deposit were lodged. Particularly, the {U.B.N} Where the decease had an account valued at about US$20m, Has issued 
me a notice to provide the {NEXT OF KIN} or have the account 
confiscated within the next 10 official working days. 

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives, I seek your 
consent to present you as the {NEXT OF KIN} of the decease since you 
are a foreigner to suite the purpose of the transaction. We have agree to share the money as follows,. 60% to me and 30% to you, While 10% has been set aside for any incidental expenses that may come up during this transaction by both parties, including the phone bills, etc.


Please, get  in  touch  with me by my private email address   to enable us  to  claim  the  fund  immediately  { f_will1@excite.com}
