Kim:

This is a gas generator with whom we are working.  We have an EEI.  Ed Sacks has been the credit point person.  They have a cogen plant, Yuba City Cogen, that is looking at a five year energy sale to PG&E and want to back it with a 5 year gas purchase.  Can you give him a call to discuss?  (Paul - Kim's number in Houston is 713/853-0685.

Chris,

Thanks for the discussion today. As we discussed, Our Yuba City project is
exploring and very interested in a long term (3 to 5 year) gas supply deal
with Enron.  We would like to speak with someone in your Houston office about
this.

Also, we would like to further understand the path to access of Enron Online.
 I'll call soon to discuss.

Sincerely,
Paul Cummins
