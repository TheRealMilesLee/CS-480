Susan,
 
Thank you for your  time on the phone today and for requesting more information on our new  study.  I have attached the brochure to this email for you to review.   This should help to give you a better idea of the detail involved. This study is  expected to give some new insight into the gas transmission industry.  Our  gas consulting team has been hard at work on this project for the last 6 months,  so there has been an abundance of work put into this  analysis.
 
The price of the  study is $9,000. However, Enron does qualify  for a 30% discount, which would drop your price to $6,300. If you decide you need this study, and if you  can give me an OK this month, I will include  a free copy of our North American Natural Gas System wall map (reg.  $495).
 
Please review the  attachment, and if you have any further questions, or if you do want to accept  the offer, please feel free to contact me at (720) 548-5496.
 
Sincerely,
Chuck Van Note
