Thanks for your note.  I will miss your sense of humor - you always put a smile on my face!   Hang in there with the California situation, and hope to see you soon.

Well, it was too brief, and I didn't get to work with you nearly as much as I'd hoped. But when I did, it was very enjoyable.  All the best.  These are strange and unsettling days, but it seems that the best among us always land on their feet, so I'm sure that's where you'll end up.  Take care and hope to cross paths again soon.

Best,
Jeff
