Kay,

I think it was around 3p.m. on Saturday.  His name is Charles (Charlie).
His middle name is something like Coudair (sp?).  Tammy has been working
on making lists and folders of all of her outstanding matters, so
hopefully we are ready to make the transition.

Sherry

I called her office and they told me.  What time Friday?  What's his
name?

Do you have a handle on what she was working on?  I wouldn't want to
bother her about anything.

Thanks Kay.  I've call off the dogs.   I guess you know that Tammy had
her baby on Friday - 5lbs. 14oz!
