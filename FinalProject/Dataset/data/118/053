Lisa,

I have worked through all of the issues and questions that Mariner had on our Keep Whole language. They are ready to see our official confirmation.  Please prepare the confirmation with the attached documents. Gerald Nemec had prepared the language in these documents specifically for this counterparty.

Judy
