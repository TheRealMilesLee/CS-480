Hello Lindy Lou,

It was such a wonderful surprize to get the nice Halloween card and the adorable picture of Sam. It made my day! Did Sam have fun trick or treating? What did Missy, Anthony and Andrew do for Halloween? How is their school year going? How is the BIG Tone?
Adam and Claire had fun-Adam was Harry Potter and Claire was a lion too!Things are really good for me. I cut my hours down to 32 hours a week and it has made all the difference in the world in terms of feeling like I can cope with this job. It has been taking a toll on me-lots of young patients our age dying and stuff. Anyway, things are Great! Marty man is doing good. I worked out with Jody Jurgens last week and it was her 1 year anniversary of being married. She's married to a very nice guy. My mom just got back from 18 days in Ireland-her 3rd time. She had a good time. Teresa and her clan were in Omaha for the game this saturday-what a blowout and Brian and his girlfriend (of 2 years) came over. We love her too. We told Brian if they break up were keeping her. Anyway I digress. I was just so touched to get that card from you and thought with all that is going on in the country right now, I've really reviewed in my life the things that really matter to me, what's really im!
portant. I just want you to know I think of you often. I have pictures of you and Tony (holdint the baby shoes) and now 2 pics of Sam up in the kitchen and living room. Even though you are not living here you and your family are loved and cared for and thought about by me often!I didn't mean to get mushy but was just thinking of you and wanted you to know. Write back and let me know the answers to my questions! PS-Amy had a baby?????That is great!L.Y.L.A.S.Holly
