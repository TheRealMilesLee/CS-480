FROM ACCOUNTANT PAUL MABUZA
JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA
TEL: 27-83-4160-572

                                     
                          PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL
 
ATTN: DIRECTOR/CEO

 I am PAUL MABUZA (FCAA), the chief accountant of African Development bank (ADB). There is an account open in thisbank in 1999 and since 2001 nobody has operated on this account again. 

After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it would be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. Smith B. Andreas, a foreigner, and a miner at Kruger Gold Company, a Geologist by profession and he died since 2000.No other person knows this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and the money involved is Thirty Six Million United States Dollars (US$ 36 Million). I want us to first transfer US$ 16 Million from this money into your safe overseas account before the rest. 

I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local bank here, but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in United States Dollars and the former owner Mr. Smith B. Andreas is a foreigner too. I know that this message will come to you as surprise as we don;t know ourselves before. but be sure that it is real and a genuine business. I only got your contact information from my secretary who operates computer; with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business, considering my position as a public servant. You are the only person that I have contacted in this business; so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take immediately.Send also your private telephone and fax numbers . I will fly to your country for withdrawal and sharing and other investment.

 Meanwhile, I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner with foreign account and foreign beneficiary. I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you as soon as you indicate your sincerity to co-operate with me, and capability to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust according to my instruction and advice for our mutual benefit because this opportunity may never come again in my life.

 I need a truthful and God fearing person in this business because I don;t want to make a mistake so I need your strong assurance and trust. With my position in the office I don;t want anything that will jeopardize my job so I advice that we should make secrecy and confidentiality our primary working condition, bearing in mind that I am a public servant.  I will also use my position and influence to effect legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance forms of the ministries and foreign exchange department. At the conclusion of this business, you will be giving 35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred the process of the transfer. I look forward to your earliest reply.

Yours sincerely,

 PAUL MABUZA.
