After interviewing the short list of candidates, the Managing Directors of ETS met today to narrow the list to the final two.  They are;
	Everett Plante
	Brad Holmes

Mark, you will be contacted by HR to schedule an interview with each of these individuals.  Stan Horton will also be asked to interview them.  A final decision can be made at the conclusion of those discussions.

Expediting this decision will assist me in taking on my new responsibilities.

If there is any information I can provide you on the responsibilities of the current EGS position or on either of the candidates please let me know.

Thank you.
