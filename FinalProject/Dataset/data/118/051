I know this could be much more thorough, but I just wanted to shoot it out 
to you asap.  If you need any more detail on the previous job duties that I 
had, just let me know and I can revise and buff it up for you.  Thanks 
again, so much, for being willing to even consider me.  (I'd make a great 
parking attendant!) :) - Christina
