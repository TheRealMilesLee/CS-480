Reagan:

I wanted to confirm that you have received Mayor Hays' letter of 11/2
detailing the process we intend to follow in concluding the RFP process.  If
you have not received Mayor Hays' letter or have any questions, please give
me a call.

Additionally, I want to confirm some information with you.

1. In your proposal you stated that you would utilized firm contracts inside
Entergy as sources for supplying NLR & Benton.  Can you identify the sources
you would initially point to for submission of the Network Transmission
Service request.

2. Confirm our understanding that your price includes Schedules 3 - 6 costs.

3.  Please identify each major party associated with Enron's proposal and
describe the role of each including contracting party, parent company of
contracting party if different, owner of resources if different and any
other parties that would have a role in the proposed transaction.

4. As you know Benton does not have a SCADA system. We are unsure about
bringing their metering points into our SCADA system.  Do you have a per
metering point price estimate to acquire the metering information directly
from Benton.

I know this is short notice but if you could respond by close of business
11/6 it would be appreciated.

Joe Gertsch
