Hi Jeff:

1) I must have missed a beat...I heard the quarter's news, but assumed
things will work out.
2) mpa@a-klaw.com
3) Is this an oral presentation?  Hearing?  Of course I'll be there, but
where did I miss the notice?

Greetings Ms Kahl:

Few things:

1)	No, I'm not looking for employment in the face of Enron's
current financial "challenges."
2)	Could you forward Michael's email address to me?
3)	Are you aware of what Edison's going to be proposing at the PUC
on Nov. 7th w.r.t. how it 	intends to recoup its "undercollection"
under its settlement with the PUC.  In short, all  	DA customers,
irrespective of whether they were taking from Edison at the time that
Edison 	accrued the "undercollection," would be "responsible" for
paying.  Which means DA customers 	would pay twice for power--once
to their ESP and now, again, to Edison.  Is this something 	that
your clients care about?  We care quite a bit.

One of the big issues is whether there ought to be hearings on all of
this, or whether Karl Wood ought to just be able to push rates around
based on briefs only.  We feel pretty strongly that hearings are
required.  One of our big concerns is that this will be the tip of the
iceberg, i.e., Edison will continue on after this in an attempt to force
all kinds of costs on customers.  You have a view on whether hearings
are required?  More importantly do your clients have an interest in all
of this, and will you be there on the 7th?

Inquiring minds want to know.

Hope you're well.  Please don't travel over any bridges.

Best,
Jeff
