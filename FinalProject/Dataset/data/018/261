Stephanie,

See attached:
	-I checked the spelling and changed the words miss-spelled
	-In para (2) deleted reference to "in ____." Per discussion with William Fleenor if the agreement is not specific to the Longview 	plant, we should have no accounting issues.
	-Added in para 16 that "ENA may disclose to it's affiliates and to"

Please let me know and will forward to Dominic. He is out today and will actually see this on Monday but want it there this week for them.

Thanks

Jeff
