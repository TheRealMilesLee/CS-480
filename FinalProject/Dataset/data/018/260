Don't Save Passwords
Internet Explorer and some web based applications give you the ability to save your password, so you don't have to type it in each time you access it.  Unfortunately, this time-saver can also get you in trouble when you are forced to change your password and the new password doesn't get saved.  We've had numerous calls to the Help Desk due to old passwords still being "saved".  To keep yourself from being a victim (and for good security), please do not save passwords when prompted.  Some examples are below...
    
  

Don't Update Software or Install Plug-Ins
Most of us have gone to a web site that prompted us to update our software version or shows a link to install a new plug-in so we can see all the fancy web page components.   Many vendor web sites let you download demos of their software.  We need to resist the temptation to do this, since it may not be approved software and could cause applications to malfunction.  This can further lead to difficulty in tracking down the cause of problems, since the workstation is now "non-standard". Only the Omaha IT staff should be installing software.  When in doubt, please contact the Help Desk for assistance.  Examples from web sites are below....Thanks!
