Jay,

I just checked my Sitara Reports access, and I was able to login and run a report, however there are still only Enron business units there, so nothing came up on the report.  I don't think the systems are synchronized yet.

Let me know if there's some other way to log in to access the UBSW testing contract/deals.

Thanks,
Susan
