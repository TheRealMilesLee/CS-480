Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).
