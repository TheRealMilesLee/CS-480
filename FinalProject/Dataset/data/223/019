2002 U.S. REGIONAL TRANSMISSION ORGANIZATION STUDY

Dear Energy Industry Professional:

As the wholesale energy and transmission sectors 
continue their dramatic transformation, it's critical for 
energy professionals to understand the latest changes 
and how they will impact the electric industry.  For the 
last decade, ever-changing, complex issues have 
characterized the regional transmission organization 
(RTO) landscape.  This year's events are no exception.  
As FERC persists in its effort to drive RTO formation, its 
latest rulings have pushed for a U.S. transmission 
industry that is increasingly regional in shape, scope, 
and function.

This year's RTO study expands upon acclaimed studies 
by EFI from the past three years:  "As the variety of 
species and subspecies multiplies in the fecund world of 
electricity transmission, Boston think tank EFI has 
produced a field guide to the critters.  EFI's United 
States Regional Transmission Organization Study 
provides an extensive breakdown of many of the thorny 
technical issues presently bedeviling the industry."  - 
Electricity Daily

EFI's RTO study provides comprehensive research on 
over 20 U.S. RTO and Transco initiatives.  In addition 
to detailing market characteristics, development and 
planning, governance, operating structures, 
transmission pricing, congestion management, and 
power exchanges for each initiative, this year's study 
analyzes the regional consolidation efforts now 
underway in the Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, and 
West.  For more information or to order the RTO study 
visit www.efinc.com or me at (781) 273-
5700 ext. 246.  Thank you.

Sincerely,

Ryan Chaytors
