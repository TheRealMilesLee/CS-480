     Tammie-

     Can you kindly confirm details of where, when, # of sessions if
     greater than one, for this presentation.  I understand you are the
     person Louise had designated to help us coordinate the
     presentation/training.  It will be a powerpoint presentation that we
     need your assistance ensuring can be projected as well ensuring the
     traders/business have adequate number of copies of hand out material.

     Attached is the presentation.  Hand outs that we require your
     assistance in handling is:

     - Presentation print out

     - Mercy Gil to supply you with a printed list of contact names phone
     and cell phones by end of day today

     - Wendy Bannerman Clarke to supply the Day 1 Policy (even if still a
     draft) as well as the Discipline and Sanction policy by end of day
     today.

     Tammie - If you can get all the hand outs in 1 pack that would be
     great but it is not required.

     Please speak with Debbie Brackett if you have any questions, issues,
     etc and we thank you very much in advance for your assistance.

     Looking forward to meeting you,
     Lisa Feld
     CRC Americas
