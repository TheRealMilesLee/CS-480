Kam,

Sorry that you will miss our wedding.  Last I heard there are still some
open weather positions at UBS.  They are apparently starting from the
ground up.  This means that they are looking to hire some chief weather wiz
(probably PHD type with some gas industry experience) first and then start
developing a department.   I also heard that UBS is likely not going to
start trading until early April.  Is this what you are hearing too? I am
keeping all my options open.  The job market is terrible and likely getting
worse.  You see what WMB and CPN have been doing lately?   Ouch!

See ya,

JR

Hey,

I am going to have to miss your wedding.  Unfortunately, I will be in Plano
that weekend.  I wish I could make it.

What's going on with the UBS weather position?  Has that gone anywhere or
are the other possibilities you had better?

Talk to you soon,

Kam

Hey guys,

I am being told by my better half that we need to get an accurate head
count of who will be attending our wedding.  If you would be so kind, could
you possibly let me know of your status over the next couple of days?  For
those of you who already sent us an RSVP response recently, please
disregard.

Thanks for your help!

Jeff
