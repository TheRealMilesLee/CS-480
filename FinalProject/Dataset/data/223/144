The Electronic Scheduling Collaborative is a collaboration of Stakeholders in the Wholesale Electric Power Industry joined for the purpose of developing standard Business Practices for Open Access Same-Time Information System (OASIS) Phase II and Electronic Scheduling.

At its January 2002 meeting, the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) adopted the Governance and Bylaws that require industry sector voting. The ESC will conduct business in accordance with the new Governance and Bylaws at its February 2002 meeting. Please see Section III: Members of the Bylaws.

If you plan to participate as an "Active Member" (i.e. represent a legitimate industry stakeholder) and vote, you must register and select the segment you will represent. The complete registration process and forms can be found at the following web site:

https://www.nerc.net/esc

The Governance and Bylaws are posted on the web site below:
