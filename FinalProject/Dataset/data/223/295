I am Mr. Li Le Song credit officer of the Foriegn Operations Dept. 
of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Taikoo Shing Branch.I have a obscured 
business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our 
client Colonel Sadiq Uday who was with the Iraqi forces and also 
business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, 
with a value of Nineteen millions Five Hundred Thousnd United 
state Dollars Only (USD$19,5M) in my branch. Upon maturity several 
notice was sent to him, even during the war early last year. 

Again after the war another notification was sent and still no 
response came from him. We later find out that the Colonel and his 
family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their 
home.After further investigation it was also discovered that 
Colonel Sadiq Uday did not declare any next of kin in his,official 
papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also 
confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one 
except me knew of his deposit in my Bank. So, Nineteen millions 
Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my 
bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. 

What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 4 years   the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Colonel Sadiq Uday so that you will be able to receive his funds.

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that 
we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that 
will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the 
next of kin to Colonel Sadiq Uday,all that is required from you at 
this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and 
Address so that the attorney can commence his job. 

After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also 
fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary 
approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the 
funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk 
involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized 
method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary 
documents.

Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account the sharing ratio is open for negotiation for you . Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefers you to reach me on the email address below (lilesongy2k@walla.com)and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation.

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards

Mr.Li Le Song
