Shelley,

What do you think?

Beez,

Since our telephone conversation concerning the special SPRC meeting, I have
prayed/thought about the topic and have the following opinion.

While I agree that this decision has to be made with the good of the entire
congregation in mind, I would like to say that my family and I feel our
personal needs are being met by Ernie and the example he provides.

We have witnessed Ernie handle delicate situations with compassion and
consideration.  We also appreciate Ernie's support during Alina's difficult
transition at ACEC.  We feel that while Ernie's sermons may be hard to
follow at times and that he is not the most outgoing person, we never have
questioned his sincerity or dedication for this church.

Having said this, we realize that we don't have the day to day contact with
Ernie that seems to be a component of the problem.  Furthermore, I don't
believe we can afford to have AUMC's membership adversely affected if this
church is to be the kind of church we hope it will be.  Therefore, I guess
my official position is that Ernie has my family's support, but AUMC is our
home and whatever is best for AUMC, that is the direction we should take. 

Kim
