Dear Chronicle Subscriber,

Tired of all those bills in your mailbox?  Want to make your life a little
'E-Z'er?  We at The Houston Chronicle understand, and that's why we offer
our subscribers the E-Z Pay Program.  E-Z Pay lets you choose one of two
bill-free ways to pay for your Houston Chronicle subscription -- Automatic
Credit Card Payment or Automatic Bank Draft.

And right now if you sign up for E-Z Pay, we'll send you (as our gift) two
FREE tickets to the movies, good any time at any Houston-area AMC Theatre!*

So to enjoy not only the convenience of Houston Chronicle home delivery,
but also the convenience of our E-Z Pay Program (and don't forget the FREE
movie tickets!), just log on at http://www.houstonchronicle.com/ezpay to
sign up today!

And, again, thanks for subscribing -- we do appreciate your business.

The Houston Chronicle
