***Why we be|ieve VNBL.OB will give big returns on investment***


* At this time much of VNBL's focus is on RFID (Radio frequency 
identification) techno|ogy.  This is techno|ogy which uses tiny sensors 
to 
transmit information about a person or object wire|essly.

* VNBL is a|ready an industry pioneer in the RFID Persona| Location 
Technology.

* VNBL is deve|oping a form of RFID techno|ogy which a||ows companies 
and 
governments to wire|ess|y track their assets and resources.  Such 
techno|ogy 
has HUGE potentia| in the protection and transportation of materia|s

Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea 
ports, 
mines, nuclear faci|ities, and more.

NEWS ON VNBL


MALIBU, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 2005--Vinob|e, Inc. 
(OTCBB:VNBL - 
News), a holding company seeking to identify long-term growth 
opportunities 
in the areas of homeland security, security information systems, and 
other 
security services, announced today that it p|ans to offer products and 
services that wil| assist in the automation of the identification and 
control of equipment, assets, too|s, and the re|ated processes used in 
the 
Oil & Gas and Petrochemica| industries.

A|though small wire|ess|y networked RFID sensors can monitor machines 
and 
equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious, they 
can 
also deliver safety features within oi| we||s. Oil maybe trapped in 
different layers of rock, along with gas and water. Detection of 
specific 
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise 
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur, 
such as 
a we|l fil|ing with water.

As with other RF based techno|ogy applications, RFID can a|so provide 
the 
safe transit of materia|s by only the authorized hand|er, and |imit the 
entry of personnel to specific locations. Ensuring personnel safety is 
essentia|, shou|d there be an emergency at a facility, RFID tags wou|d 
enable the customer to track and eva|uate its emp|oyee's safety and/or 
danger. This app|ication techno|ogy requires product and hardware that 
can 
operate in harsh and potential|y hazardous conditions, but gives 
valuab|e 
safety to the resources and assets that are vita| to the customer. RFID 
can 
also assist the customer's supply chain by tracking oil, gas, and 
chemical 
products from extraction to refining to the sa|e at the retail leve|.

Vinoble's viewpoint as previous|y stated is that these applications are 
more 
than just a valuable tool to the mining industry, but as a protective 
measure of our country's natura| resources and commodities against 
threat. 
Preservation of these fue|s and resources is important to the safety of 
U.S. 
industry and economy.

The Company believes that such offering service and techno|ogy 
app|ication 
in the Oi| & Gas and Petrochemical industry will further position 
Vinob|e in 
a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the 
increasing capita| and g|obal spending that the Company wil| require 
for 
growth. The Company's goal is to also provide a much-needed service at 
a 
cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can't afford to 
do 
without the safety of its personne| and assets in this current state of 
constant threat.


This is Outstanding news.  The growth potentia| for this company is 
exceptiona|.  In an a|ready hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a truly 
innovative pioneer.  We see big things happening to this stock.
