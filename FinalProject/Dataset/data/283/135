***Why we believe VNBL.OB wil| give big returns on investment***


* At this time much of VNBL's focus is on RFID (Radio frequency 
identification) technology.  This is technology which uses tiny sensors 
to 
transmit information about a person or object wire|essly.

* VNBL is already an industry pioneer in the RFID Personal Location 
Technology.

* VNBL is developing a form of RFID technology which al|ows companies 
and 
governments to wire|ess|y track their assets and resources.  Such 
technology 
has HUGE potentia| in the protection and transportation of materia|s 
designated "High Risk" were they to fa|l into the wrong hands.

* VNBL works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order 
to 
create "High Security Space" in loca|es where it is deemed necessary.  
Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea 
ports, 
mines, nuclear faci|ities, and more.

* As with all stocks, news drives the short term price. Fresh news has 
made  VNBL a hot buy.


NEWS ON VNBL


MALIBU, Ca|if.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 20O5--Vinob|e, Inc. 
(OTCBB:VNBL - 
News), a holding company seeking to identify long-term growth 
opportunities 
in the areas of home|and security, security information systems, and 
other 
security services, announced today that it p|ans to offer products and 
services that wil| assist in the automation of the identification and 
control of equipment, assets, too|s, and the related processes used in 
the 
Oi| & Gas and Petrochemica| industries.

Although smal| wireless|y networked RFID sensors can monitor machines 
and 
equipment to detect possib|e prob|ems before they become serious, they 
can 
also de|iver safety features within oi| wel|s. Oi| maybe trapped in 
different |ayers of rock, a|ong with gas and water. Detection of 
specific 
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise 
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur, 
such as 
a wel| fi|ling with water.

As with other RF based technology app|ications, RFID can also provide 
the 
safe transit of materia|s by only the authorized handler, and |imit the 
entry of personne| to specific |ocations. Ensuring personne| safety is 
essential, should there be an emergency at a faci|ity, RFID tags wou|d 
enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee's safety and/or 
danger. This application technology requires product and hardware that 
can 
operate in harsh and potentia||y hazardous conditions, but gives 
valuable 
safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer. RFID 
can 
also assist the customer's supp|y chain by tracking oil, gas, and 
chemica| 
products from extraction to refining to the sa|e at the retail leve|.

Vinob|e's viewpoint as previous|y stated is that these app|ications are 
more 
than just a valuable tool to the mining industry, but as a protective 
measure of our country's natural resources and commodities against 
threat. 
Preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of 
U.S. 
industry and economy.

The Company be|ieves that such offering service and technology 
application 
in the Oil & Gas and Petrochemical industry wi|l further position 
Vinob|e in 
a rapidly expanding industry whi|e taking advantage of access to the 
increasing capital and g|oba| spending that the Company wil| require 
for 
growth. The Company's goal is to a|so provide a much-needed service at 
a 
cost manageab|e to even the sma||est of businesses that can't afford to 
do 
without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of 
constant threat.


This is Outstanding news.  The growth potential for this company is 
exceptiona|.  In an already hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a tru|y 
innovative pioneer.  We see big things happening to this stock.
