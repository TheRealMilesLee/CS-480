Dear Sir/Madam,

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I
believe everyone will die someday.

My name is Erik Jaochim a merchant from Norway, I have been
diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical
treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live,
according to medical experts.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared
for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I
was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on
my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret
all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to
have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a se=
cond
chance to come to this world I would live my life a different
way from how I have lived it.

Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property a=
nd
assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close=

friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have de=
cided
to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the la=
st
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charit=
y
organizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and Malaysia.

Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself
anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts an=
d
distribute the money which I have there to charity organizations in Bulga=
ria
and Pakistan; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do
not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have=

left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cas=
h
deposit of four Million five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars ($4,5=
00,000.00)
that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad.

I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to
charity organizations of your choice. If you know that you are willing
to assist me in this matter, let me know, because you are going to deal
with my Attorney, you can then discuss the percentage from there. My
hands, Legs and all my entire body is very weak, so i will not always
be very strong to respond to you. Though i have a Lap top in the
Hospital which i will be using to know the position of things.I will want=

you to indicate your interest in this transaction by sending your contact=

informations via my private email which is divinecool2@netscape.net .

God be with you,
Erik Jaochim .
