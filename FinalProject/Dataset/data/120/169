Subject: 	Fire Drills and Emergency Response

Periodically we review our procedures during fire drills in the building. Historically, I understand that the Gas Controllers on duty have not moved to the stairwells during a drill. We need to change that practice. We are required by the Fire Marshall to have everyone move to the stairwells during future fire drills. The short time normally required to be away from the console until the all-clear is sounded should not impact the integrity of the pipeline systems. 

We are also reviewing our short notice emergency response procedures. We have excellent procedures for events such as hurricanes, but we are preparing for events, such as a threat that would require everyone to leave the building immediately. Our interim offsite location in these situations is the Enron hanger at Intercontinental Airport. In the near future, we will be conducting a drill of these procedures, so don't be surprised if someone from our management team comes into Gas Control and asks you to proceed to the hanger on short notice. 

Thanks in advance for your co-operation, and thank you for the great job everyone is doing.
