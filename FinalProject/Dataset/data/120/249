It was Mark wilson who is no longer here.  I am trying to get a new name from the London people. 

Assuming they approve this what is the turnaround you think?

Sara,

I just left you a voice mail about this.

We need to amend the Bear guaranty to cover the new ECT Europe Finance that we moved the Anker positions into.  By amending the guanranty I can free up $2.5mm cash.

Please tell me if this can happen.

Thanks,

Tom
