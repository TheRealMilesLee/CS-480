Ross -

Have we signed a confidentiality agreement with Cargill?  I need to know for purposes of completing the letter for you.

Also, just so that we can keep track of the status of these matters, could you please request a letter from either me or Tana and we will prepare them.  This will enable use to keep files of the agreements and know what is going on.  It will also make the timing for initialing and signing faster as I will not have to review the agreements prior to initialiing them.

Thanks.

Mark

Mark,

Attached is a channel letter from PwC for Cargill.  It is the same letter that we used with them for Koch, except for the meeting date deadline has changed.  Please review and initial so that we can execute.

Thanks
Ross

(See attached file: EOLletteragreement-Cargill-11-5-01.doc)

I spoke with a few people in our organization.  As I feared, we have
already spoke with Oracle and Siebel.  That said, we are interested in
exploring other companies that you may have stong relationships with.
One company name that came up was Novell.

Thanks for the names, I am confident that we will find something.

Mike Bridges
