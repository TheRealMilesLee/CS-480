Don, the duck hunting went great.  We bagged over 30 ducks (between 6 guys).  They were a combination of pintail, teal, buffalo head, and blue bills.  

The guides provide the dog, decoys, blinds, transportation, and they call them in for you.  They will let you call if you want, but the guides are top notch.

My uncle and I are thinking of going down this weekend or the next.  Let me know if you are interested, and we will reserve you a spot with us. 

Lyle

Lyle,

Thanks for the note.  How did the hunt go?  Did you have to bring decoys?  How did the guides do callin' in the ducks?

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thanks,

Don, it was great talking to you about hunting and shooting today.  Below is the link to Central Flyway Outfitters (CFO).  They are a top notch guide service out of Winnie, Texas (near Beaumont) that specialize in duck and goose hunting.  They have hunting packages around $150 a gun (they offer corporate discounts as well).  All you need is a license, shells, gun, and waders:  they will take care of the transportation (4 wheelers), guide, and dog.  

I am heading down there tomorrow for a hunt with my uncle.  I will let you know how we do.  If you are interested I can arrange hunt on a future Saturday or Sunday morning.  Regards, Lyle
