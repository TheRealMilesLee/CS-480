Jeff -
I appreciated your comments in the meeting about not jumping to conclusions of guilt. 

Obviously, as I am friends w/ at least three people who were affected, I'm concerned about the perception of yesterday's events. I would like to say that while I understand that red flags were raised, the procedure for dealing with what are, according to you, only suspicions seems to me not only draconian but also extremely counterproductive to the general morale of everyone who relies on the fundamentals' group's strong work.

I assume that the procedure was not concocted by you and trust that, if there are opportunities to question/change it, you will add my views to those of others who think similarly.
Thanks very much,
Russ
