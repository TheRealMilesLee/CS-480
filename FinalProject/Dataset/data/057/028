For Monday,   it is necessary that we sell the following for Frontera:

he 4 -30mw's
he 5 - 30 mw's
he 7 - 30 mw's
he 23 - 85 mw's 
he 24 - 85 mw's


Also,   we need  to buy 15 mw's for hour ending 7 to assist with Frontera's ramp.

We are not running the plant this weekend.    The Resource Plan should reflect that we are available but offline.
We need to ensure that the minimums and maximums accurately reflect what the plant is capable of.
Also,  please make sure that the OOM premiums (up & down) are input as $50 and $40 respectively.

FYI - for OOM up,  we receive a 14.1 heat rate multiplied by the Houston Ship Channel price.   For this weekend assume $2.05.   IF you can make hourly,  bal-day sales in excess of this,  check with Jerry or Ken at Frontera.

Steve Olinde is notifying Ercot that we are coming down this weekend  for economics.   We have given them this notice so that they can effectively manage their system.


I will be out of town this weekend.   I can be reached by my cell if you have an important issue.

Thanks,
JMF
