Good Day. 

It is my sincere prayers and wishes that the year has been fulfilling and 
rewarding for you and your family. Sorry to surprise you and take some of your 
time in going through this unexpected letter of plea for your understanding 
and assistance.
This message may come as a surprise as we have not met, but we are desperately 
in need of help. I got this contact out of desperation and frustration, via a 
comprehensive search on the Internet.

I am a victim of the last Sunday the 26th of December 2004 Tsunami Strike 
where I lost my whole family and virtually everything I have labored for, My 
name is Mohmodu Sammi a Saudi national and a merchant in Indonesia, Now I have 
been diagnosed with prostate, esophageal Cancer and High Blood Pressure that 
was discovered after the strike and shock from the heavy under water wave that 
claimed many lives. I have only about a few months to according to medical 
experts.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for 
anyone not even myself but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never 
generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that 
was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this, as I now know that 
there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the 
world.
Presently, I'm in my house here in London where I have been undergoing 
treatment for esophageal cancer. I have now lost my ability to talk and my 
doctor have told me that I have only a few months to live. It is my last wish 
to see that my money distributed to Victims of the Tsunami using the allocated 
Agencies like the UNICEF, UN. SAVE THE CHILDREN etc.

The last of my money, which is the huge cash deposit that I have with 
Financial Firm in London .I will want you to help me collect this deposit and 
dispatched it to charity organizations in charge of the tsunamis victims and 
let them know that it is I, Mohmodu Sammi that is making this generous 
donation.

I am writing this from my laptop computer in my hospital bed where I wait for 
my time to come. I pray that God uses you to support and assist me with good 
heart

I am not afraid of death hence I have seen plenty of them in recent times. I 
don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my soundless 
voice and inability to talk. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you 
the contact details of the holding firm in London where the funds are 
presently been held in safe custody.

I await your response.

Trustfully Yours

Mohmodu Sammi
