 	   <http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/marketing/html-mailings/purchase_circles/spacer.gif>	 	 Dear Amazon.com Customer, 

As a resident of the greater Houston area, you might like a cool sneak peek into what Houston is reading, listening to, watching, and more. Our unique-to-Houston pages <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/223001/ref=mk_cust_pcrc_48> feature the items that Houston customers are buying more of than anyone else--plus savings of up to 20% off. 

We've handpicked some titles of special local interest, too. You can explore all the things in town you've been meaning to with Fodor's CityGuide: Houston, sing along to Songs We Wish We'd Written by Texans Pat Green and Cory Morrow, and revisit that famous Houston quote from the film Apollo 13 on DVD.

Since the Texans' season is just getting started, you should still have some time to check out your town's favorite books, music, movies, and more <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/223001/ref=mk_cust_pcrc_49>--plus, get savings of up to 20% off. Keep up on what has your community clicking! 

Sincerely, 
  <http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/marketing/html-mailings/purchase_circles/sig_houston.gif>
