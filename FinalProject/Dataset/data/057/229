In the european csfb prepay which was just extended, morgan stanley was also involved for a related swap of the same amount. I think csfb was aware of that on the euro prepay. Has it been mentioned yet? Treasa knows the details.

I wonder if RBS is another institution which could move quickly. They have capacity now.
