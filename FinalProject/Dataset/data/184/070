On November 17, 2O04, Yap Internationa| revealed a unique and patent 
pending techno|ogy marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap Internationa| 
Personal Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Persona| Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending solution to a real prob|em that is inherent in 
a|l current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is |imited to the physical location of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP call. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending technology a||ows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled calls from any telephone, not just 
one physica||y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|l their Persona| Gateway from any ce||u|ar or land|ine push 
button phone in the world, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP ca|l savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partia|ly or entire|y the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
te|ecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2O04, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract involving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
International 
announced the signing of an exclusive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Central and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exc|usive 
contractua| 
agreement with the second largest carrier in the region for 20O,OO0 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatema|a in 2O05. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 milli0n USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products wi|l comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exc|usive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 2005, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ura| State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of

physics of electro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background also inc|udes direct 
invo|vement in the development of proprietary technologies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cellu|ar phone network for the city of Che|yabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Milliken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Te|ephone Inc. of Russia.
