We have had a lot of discussion on the contractual arrangements we would need to put in place in order to recommence trading as quickly as possible.  I am working on producing a fuller list for you today.  However, there is one particular contract/licence which does require special treatment - Power Marketing Licence to be granted by FERC.  In order to ensure that we start this process as quickly as possible we are looking to complete the filing documentation in advance of the bankruptcy decision on our future.
 
Our current strategy is as follows (all dates are approximate)
 
Present - January 10th, 2002        Complete filing documentation
January 11th                                Visit with FERC (One of senior executives here plus a senior executive from our buyer)
January 13th                                 File and request an expedited process
 
It would be extremelly helpful if you could identify someone for the Head of our Regulatory Group (Jim Steffes) to co-ordinate with at Citi.
 
Thanks
 
Louise
