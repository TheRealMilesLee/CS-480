Trevor - Here is a list of Excel files that I have created that you might find useful.  If you do not have access to the "CES" folder on the O: drive, please ask Scott to approve access for you.  All files are under O:/CES/....

	1.) Kristin Quinn/CES/NOx Controls Forecast
	2.) Kristin Quinn/CES/NOx Sources Allowed Table
	3.) Kristin Quinn/Emissions Project/Utility Fax Alerts - I put this table together for Adam; it lists all SCR announcements made on the McIlvaine website
	4.) Kristin Quinn/allplantsdata - spreadsheet and chart of all coal-fired power plants that fall under the NOx SIP Call
	5.) Kristin Quinn/Compliance Costs for 4 units
	6.) Kristin Quinn/fakeplantsdata - gives capital and O&M costs for power plants with varying MWs and NOx rates
	7.) NOx Costs/NOx Costs 92900
	8.) Marketing Files/Templates/Client Basecase - model used for Client's traditional compliance plan
	9.) Marketing Files/Templates/NOxTech Basecase - model for Client's system using NOxTech
	10.) NOx and SO2 Data/CUECost/CUECost3 - spreadsheet put out by the EPA for a variety of APC tecnologies; the User's Manual is on my desk

Please let me know if you have any more questions.  I hope this helps!
Kristin
