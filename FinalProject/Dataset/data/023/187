This latest version corrects errors on the ending positions.  Another version will be coming out soon to
correct the Total Market Chart.

Hey Trevor
Once again here is the latest SO2 Report revision.  This rev adds the Summary Sheet which contains the list of Top Ten Shorts and Top Ten Longs.  We will get to Top Ten Transactions next week.  It also generates the chart showing the Projected Total Market Ending Positions.  Let me know if you have any comments and/or suggestions.


 
As always, just copy the attachment to C:\Program Files\SO2Report\
