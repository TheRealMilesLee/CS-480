heh he hehe...
i'm fine, i knew this was coming, sadly, so i've a bit
of cashola stashed away, and i'm not really looking
yet, as there is NOTHING out way in the way of web
producing, so i'm working on this film and hanging out
and having fun... not freaked out at all, i always
land on my feet... slightly scared, of course, but
also a bit energized... oh well... i did find out
though that although there a zero web producing jobs
there are literally thousands of unemployed web
producers.... wow, i feel like i've finally found my
tribe... 

and how are you and can we shooooot in your fabulous
living room if we need to and i think you are cute!
