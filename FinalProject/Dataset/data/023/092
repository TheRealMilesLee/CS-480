Dear Japan Business Executive:

        We thought you might be interested in highlights of what appears in
the August issue (www.SuccessStories.com/current.htm) of our print
publication, SUCCESS STORIES: JAPAN Executive Newsletter.  Feel free to pass
this message along to any colleagues who may find it relevant or useful.  To

SPECIAL REPORT: THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF CORPORATE JAPAN
        With so much attention now focused on which Koizumi reforms are
really required to reform Japan's economy, we went directly to ask someone
who evaluates the strategy and performance of specific Japanese corporations
every day.  The Director of Corporate Ratings at Standard & Poor’s Japan
offers his views on whether Japan's managers are ready for and actively
engaging in real restructuring.  He shares what he knows about Japanese
corporates' financial sophistication, systems, accounting standards, credit
trends, and the overall current state of corporate Japan’s financial health.


 
A SPECIALIST OFFERS ADVICE: "A JAPAN ACQUISITION THAT (LUCKILY) NEVER 
CLOSED" (PART TWO)
        This second part of our specialist's two-part article about an
acquisition abandoned because of employee compensation and benefit issues
offers a rare, inside look at some of the ‘brass tacks’ issues that
companies often consider during such a process. Readers who have not
participated in such a process may find some of our contributor's notes to
his client, included in this article, rather harsh in their tone and intent.
Nevertheless, the notes demonstrate the complexity of the many issues
acquiring executives face in evaluating a potential acquisition in Japan,
and should not be construed as anything but a competent professional’s best
advice to an important client.     


JAPAN INSIGHT: GET THE SCOOP
        Certain of Japan's internet cafes offer a little-known and
inexpensive sampling and product research opportunity; Business Indicator:
Which executives are flying to Japan these days? -- It might surprise you;
St. Jude Medical seeks continued growth; Japan was just a way station to
greater responsibilities for these executives.


FROM THE EDITORS
        Information is another key to transforming Japan's economy...
