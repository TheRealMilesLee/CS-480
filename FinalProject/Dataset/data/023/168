company has a nominal cash position. The company is going to need 
financing to comp|ete some business transactions and begin revenue producing.

continue as a going concern in which case you could |ose your entire 
investment. 0ther factors include general economic and business conditions, the 
abi|ity to acquire and develop specific projects, the ability to fund 
operations and changes in consumer and business consumption habits and
