FROM:Mr.Patrick Otiono
Dear Friend,
I am Mr.Patrick Otiono from the First Bank of Nigeria
Plc,Lagos BranchI got your contact through the internet.I
have urgent and very confidential business proposal for
you.
On June 6, 1999, an America Oil Consultant/contractorwith
the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,Mr. Charles
Ballassi made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve
calendar months, valued at US$9,700,000.00(Nine Million
Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars )in my branch upon maturity.


I sent a rountine notification to his forwarding address
but got no reply.After a month,we sent a reminder and
finally we discovered from his contract employers,the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Charles
Ballassi died in the plane crash of 31 October 1999[with
Egyptian 990] with other passengers aboaed on further
investigation, i found out that he died without making a
WILL, and attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that
Mr. Charles Ballassi did not declare any next of kin or
relations in all his official documents, including his bank
deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$9,700,000.00
is still in my bank and the interest is being rolled over
with the pricipal sum at the end of each year.

No one will ever come forward to claim it,According to
Nigerian law, at the expiration of (five)years, the money
will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if
nobody applies to claim the fund.
Consequently,my proposal is that i will like you as a
foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Charles
Ballassi so that the fruit of this old man's labour will
not get into the hands of some corrupt Government
officials.
This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your
full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the
necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in
place as the next of kin.We shall employ the service oftwo
attorney for the drafting and notarization of the WILLand
obtain the ecessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favour for the transfer.

Any bank account in any part of the world which you will
provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money
toyou as the eneficiary/next of kin.
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in
ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you 10% will be for any
expenses that may be incure in the course of transaction.
There is no risk at all, the paperwork for this transaction
will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch
Manager guarantees the successful execution of ths
transaction.
If you are interested,please reply immediately via the
private email address below,upon your responce,i shall
provide you with more details and relevant documents that
will help you understand the transaction.
Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured
that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because
i shall require your assitance to invest my share in your
country.
Please upon the reciept of this mail message, send to me
the following to enable start the process of the fund into
your bank account:
1. Your full Name
2.Your private Telephone and fax numbers
Awaiting your urgent reply via my email:
