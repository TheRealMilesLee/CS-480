FYI.  You won't hear from me again until I have a constructive solution to this potentially insolveable problem.

The draft I sent you of the triangular setoff provision may still require significant revision. I have the following primary concerns which are not easily reconciled:

1. for an assignment to be effective it must take effect prior to bankruptcy or mutuality will be lost by the interposition of a bankruptcy trustee;

2. although words of present assignment are used,  under the current wording the assignment probably does not occur at least until there is a defaulting party;

3. if we should wish to characterize it as a general assignment for security purposes (perfection of which would require registration), there does appear to be any obligation  between X and XA (as opposed to Y) for which the assignment is to secure performance.

When you are available, I would like to speak to you regarding the foregoing.
Regards,
