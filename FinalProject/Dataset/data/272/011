BBC Headline - Smoking and obesity 'age people' 

Being overweight and a smoker makes a person biologically 
older than slim non-smokers of the same birth age, UK and 
US researchers have found.

Smoking accelerated the ageing of key pieces of a person's 
DNA by about 4.6 years. For obesity it was nine years. Excess 
fat is believed to disrupt the chemical proposition of the body 
in a negative way. Such stressors can damage the body. 

Don't be one of these people, it's time for a change.
