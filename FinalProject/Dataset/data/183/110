Rick,
How are you doing?

Where is Steve off too?  Did he even say goodbye?

I'm still perseverating over Enron.  I can't help myself.  Horrible 
time to be laid off -- can't talk to be people to find work because 
everyone is on vacation.

I've heard lots of rumors about severance.  Has Enron asked or is it 
planning to ask the BK court for real severance for employees already 
dumped or is its plan only to seek real severance for those who were 
kept on after Dec 3?  I finally got my expense check deposited.  That 
was welcome.  What about all our vendors? Did they get screwed too? 
All - or some -- do we pay our utility bill but not our $500 bill to 
the AReM lobbyist?  Do we pay Safeway for drinks for the fridge, but 
not our $3000 retainer to Dan Douglass?  This all seems arbitrary, 
crass and unfair.  How can Ken Lay look at himself in the mirror 
every day knowing how many employees he has harmed?  I can understand 
how the Company cannot control the stock market and the effects of 
that implosion, but I cannot understand how can the Company can 
brazenly cut so many people with only a $4500, less taxes, etc., 
check as so-called severance -- not even paying accrued vacation .  I 
and many others would feel a lot better about the Company if our 
rights and good will hadn't been trampled on.

I haven't been able to look for work much -- no one is around.  So, I 
guess I'm spending too much time thinking about this stuff.

Here comes 2002, Thank God!
