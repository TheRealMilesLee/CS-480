NNG had EDI problems this morning,  Evidently TMS ran out of disc space causing all of the files to get hung up in the HUB for the Final cycle and the ID1 cycle. The help desk was paged at 7:35 a.m. to report the problem , Toby responded, but was having trouble reaching the on call TMS. We did not get a response until 8:55 a.m. from TMS , the EDI files were in the HUB for over two hours. Mary Draemer was very helpful and made follow up calls so we could relay an estimated time frame to our customers when this problem would be resolved. Monday 12/31/2001 we also experienced printer problems , we were told that a print server was down, the Solution Center was redirecting print servers on an individual basis at our work stations. Kathy Washington could not print this morning and had tried to contact someone at the Solution Center, and did not receive a response back for quite a while, we went through the Help desk (Toby) and either he contacted Glen or Glen responded to the earlier page, We had several technical problems to work through this morning, but the most critical problem was trying to reach our support people.

New Years Morning Crew,
Kathy Washington
