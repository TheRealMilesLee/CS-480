ENW submitted our preliminary revised budget two weeks ago.  In our meeting in the Board Room, we did acknowledge that the ENW budget is very dependent upon the business plans of the business units that we support.  Since our budget meeting was the first that you conducted, we agreed that the ENW revised 2002 budget would need to be reviewed again once the business plans and associated budgets for other Enron business units were completed.  Has that process been completed such that we can now re-evaluate the 2002 budget for ENW?  

I will follow up with you or someone on your staff on January 2 so that we can complete this budget process.  

I hope that you and your family enjoyed the holidays.  --Sally
