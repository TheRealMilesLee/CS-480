Tanya:

I don't remember if I forwarded this on or not.  When we receive counterparties' paper, should we forward on to you or would you prefer we send them to Jay or someone else?

Marie

Hello Marie, per our conversation this morning, please find attached Coastal
States Trading, Inc.'s standard schedules, along with a copy of our guaranty
format.  We prefer to make proposed changes directly on the electronic
version(as opposed to hard copy).  Please red-line the schedule on the PC,
put a draft date in the upper right hand corner of the first page of both
schedules, then email the schedules back to John Shuttee for review.  John
will handle all negotiations for this ISDA.  He can be reached at
713/420-3548 or john.shuttee@elpaso.com.

Thanks for attention to this matter.

CKC
