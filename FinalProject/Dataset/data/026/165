All, 

Here is the link to the new TW Daily Unsubscribed Capacity Report in our test environment:  http://twdev.ets.enron.com/twdb/etfr_avcap_unsub_links.html

You can also navigate to the test site through the menu starting at http://twdev.ets.enron.com/, then selecting:  Informational Postings/Capacity/Unsubscribed/Unsubscribed Daily.

Please keep in mind........We realize there is a lot of left to right, right to left scrolling on this report and definitely will not be printer friendly, but in the limited timeframe we have to get this on the site this was the quickest and simplest way to do this.  With a little time we will see how we can make this report more functional for the users.

Thx,

Toby

Subject:	Unsubscribed Daily Capacity Report

UPDATE--Yesterday it was suggested that if Legal were to concur we would post capacity for a rolling 31 day period such that we would effectively be posting capacity which could be sold for one day up to 29 or 30 days so long as it was less than one full month.
Legal has agreed we can interpret the Order to allow this type of posting and Marketing has agreed with the idea as well.  Hence the IT people have reworked the Unsubscribed Daily Capacity Report to reflect a rolling 31 day period.  Toby will be sending out the link to review the example today.  The filing at FERC and the initial report will still indicate that no daily capacity is currently available.  If you have any questions feel free to give me a call at X7419.  Thanks.  gh
