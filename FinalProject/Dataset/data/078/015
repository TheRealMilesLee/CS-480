Steven,
 
I would like to thank you for the opportunity to interview with Enron and discuss the opportunities that exist at your company. You are surely very busy these days, and I appreciate you taking time out of your schedule to talk with students at Rice. I believe that my desire for long-term challenge and my ambition to help a company like Enron succeed in new markets make for a natural fit.  I wish you all the best, and hope to see you in the future!
 
Sincerely,
