This is worth considering. Let's all be careful! 


Hi All - 

I think you all know that I don't send out hoaxes and don't do the 
reactionary thing and send out just anything that crosses my path.  This one, 
however, is a friend of a friend and I've given it enough credibility in my 
mind that I'm writing it up and sending it out to all of you. 

My friend's friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a month ago. 
She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up. She was understandably 
upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied. 

On 9/10, she received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he wished 
he could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it had to be like 
that. The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get on any 
commercial airlines on 9/11 and to not to go any malls on Halloween. As 
soon as everything happened on the 11th, she called the FBI and has since 
turned over the letter. 

This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on.  This came 
from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last night. 

I may be wrong, and I hope I am. However, with one of his warnings being 
correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the second 
and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same information 
that I did.
