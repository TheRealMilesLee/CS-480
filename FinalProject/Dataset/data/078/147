This is Planning's response to your request of 10/10/2001 regarding two new gas wells hook up into TW's system.
The two wells were as follows:

SE/4 of Section 20- 23S-27E Eddy County, NM 

This well is located near Sid Richardson gathering system and approximately 4.4 miles to the suction side of the TW- Keystone Compressor Station.
The suction pressure at Keystone is 525-575 psig.
Are they interested to build up to 4.5 miles of pipe to TW? If they are what is pressure/maximum volume that this well can produce?


Center of Section 22-Block B-3 PSL Winkler County Texas

This well is located approximately .3-.5 mile to TW-Crawford 16" lateral. The Crawford lateral line pressure is 680-720 psig.
Can this well meet TW's line pressure ? what is the maximum flow rate on this well?


Please share this information with your customer and let me know about your response on this project? 

   
Mansoor

I am looking to see if TWPL is close to the two wells that are about to drilled. I work with Lori Vining at Beacon Petroleum and I am trying to find Pipelines in the area.
The areas are:
Eddy County, New Mexico - SE/4 of SECT 20  23S-27E.
Winkler County, Texas - Center of SECT 22 - B3 Public School Land
I went out to the Point catalog and looked up the counties to see what was in the area and found some information, but I was just wanting to make sure I get it right.
I would appreciate any help.
Thank you for time,
Cathy Pittman
