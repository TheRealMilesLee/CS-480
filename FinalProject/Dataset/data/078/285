Backed by popular demand.....

I am collecting money for Squaw Valley discount ski tickets.

If you are interested in purchasing these tickets, you MUST give me your 
money by Tuesday, October 23rd.  We need to purchase at least 50 tickets to 
get the deal (last year this was not a problem).

The tickets are $47 a piece. (full price is $56)
(If you have extra vouchers from last year you can give me those + $2 each, 
and I can get you tickets for this year).

Please make your checks out to me and put them in my box by Tuesday, 
October 23rd..

See you on the slopes!
