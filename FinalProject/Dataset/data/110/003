Please review asap as dynegy would like to put in place for the next settlement.  We currently settle gross with them.  On Duke, does the document address the power stuff? I thought Carol said it only addressed gas (regardless of their intent). Please give me call.  My asst will track me down or cell is 713-857-3887

Thanks

Pete,

Attached please find my comments and suggested revisions for the Master
Netting Agreement with Enron.  I have noted in paragraph 6(h) (and the same
comments applies to paragraph 6(i)) that I need further explanation of the
provision itself, and I will be happy to discuss this provision with
someone from Enron or someone in our shop.

For the most part, the agreement looks pretty good.  Most of my changes
focused on the arbitration clause.  Given the nature of this Agreement, we
should be careful to include all of the counterparty agreements (for
example, I added a reference to a GISB in place between DMT and Enron
Energy Services).  If the list of agreements becomes too extensive, then we
may want to consider simply listing all of the various Enron entities and
Dynegy entities by name within the body of the Agreement, and attaching an
exhibit that specifies the Underlying Master Agreements that are in effect
at the time this Netting Agreement is executed.

Please contact me with any questions or comments you may have.

Thanks.

Ernie
