After a year and a half without having a tournament, this is a test to see how many e-mail addresses are still working.
 
The Golf Committees' initial plan is to have a tournament on Saturday of Super Bowl weekend.
 
If you receive this e-mail - great.  Also, please send me any new neighbor e-mail addresses so they can be included on the golf list.
 
Spread the word …….
 
Thanks,
