Mary,  I have eight companies that are ranked as 3's.  Below are the dates I have tentatively marked down for CB meetings.  Since you are the only required attendee, I have not reserved meeting rooms at this point.  I think all the 17th floor rooms are pretty well booked anyway.  I was thinking we could meet in your cube to discuss these companies on the given dates.  

Company #		Date

551			11/14
1572			11/19 (this is the same day as company 20R.  we might be able to do them at the same time)
47E			11/20
890			11/26
986			11/29
1095			12/5

003 			12/13 (these are both divisions of 367)
1700			12/13  


In addition to these companies, I have the following tentative dates planned for my 4's:

Company #		Date

1573			11/26 (the same day as 890.  both are divisions of 985)

1407			11/28

1650			12/18 (these are all the same type of company, and do not have much activity at all)
1688			12/18
1690			12/18
1691			12/18
1699			12/18


Let me know your thoughts/availability for these dates.  I figure we can plan a time around when you are free on each specific day.
