Sue:

Ken is planning to do this.

The format has been changed a couple of times, and now we have a set of questions for Gary Hamel to ask Ken.  Jeff Gray will send the final set of (still-draft) questions to you.  Ken has the questions, so they could change.

Rob--are you working on a speech/panel discussion that Ken Lay is supposed to be involved in November 7-8 in New York CIty sponsored by FOrtune Magazine and hosted by Mayor Guiliani?  If Mr. Lay is still intending to participate, I need a bit more information to be able to leverage the work that we have been doing in New York.
