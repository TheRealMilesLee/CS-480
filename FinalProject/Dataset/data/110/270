As you may recall, the SAP system response time was slow during the September Quarter-end close period. The Integrated Solutions Center (ISC) has been working diligently to address the root causes of this issue and can report that significant progress has been made.  With the October month-end close fast approaching, we want to provide you with an update as to the progress made in identifying and addressing the root causes for slow system response.

Poor Performing Programs
The ISC has identified a number of poor performing programs.  Some program redesign has already occurred with continued efforts proceeding through year end.  In addition, system and data base parameters as well as indexes have been tuned. These actions have resulted in improvements that should enable Enron to realize better system response in the upcoming close.

Workload Distribution
The ISC has identified jobs, both scheduled and user submitted, that result in system "bottlenecks".  We have accelerated the purchase of system hardware to provide additional capacity and expect this upgrade to occur prior to year-end close. In addition, the ISC has implemented a plan to provide business users with more information regarding efficient methods of report execution.  Workshops are currently being conducted with key "close-users" from the various business units to provide techniques that will enable more efficient report execution during the close process. 

Improved Close Monitoring
The ISC has been working to heighten the monitoring of key close jobs in order to more effectively identify and resolve close related issues. An initiative is underway to improve the utilization of automated tools to better monitor, identify, and escalate close-related problems.  

Communication Strategy Implement
The ISC has established a plan to more effectively communicate to our customers in the event of future system performance issues.  This plan will ensure that information will be provided to users regarding system performance and resolution status in a timely manner.

Please feel free to contact me if you would like additional details regarding our efforts to improve overall system performance.
