Subject: Collection Wording in Assignment Letters



Michelle, 

Please review the following wording highligted in red.  Our goal is to be able to automatically deduct any outstanding balances (tax advances, expense advances/loans) from assignees when they terminate.  The collections are usually offset against the vacation payout & severance.  

If EMPLOYEE's assignment by COMPANY, as described in this Assignment Letter, is terminated by COMPANY or by EMPLOYEE, upon such termination, regardless of the reason therefore, all compensation and all benefits to EMPLOYEE under this Assignment Letter shall terminate; and any outstanding balances due COMPANY will be deducted from any remaining payments due EMPLOYEE.  If EMPLOYEE's employment hereunder is terminated by COMPANY, then EMPLOYEE may be eligible for severance payments as set forth and governed by the Enron Corp. Severance Pay Plan (Restated January 1, 1993).  ...

Tim, 

I added the wording to Section VIII of the letter, Item F, Terminations.  Attached is the full text for reference. 

Thanks,

Agreed. 

Mike,  Take a look at the AL template and let me know where you inserted.  We'll need to run by Michelle Cash and then roll out to London etc.

We can probably keep it non-tax specific, i.e., to include items like expense report advances or other loans. 

Should your employment with the Company cease, any outstanding balances due the Company will be deducted from any remaining payments due you.

I propose that we submit the following paragraph into the assignment letters which states that we can deduct any funds owed to Enron for tax settlements from future severance payments:  

"Please note that should your employment with the Company cease and it is determined that you owe a refund to Enron after your tax return is calculated, the Company has the authority to deduct these funds from any future severance payments."

Please feel free to make any necessary changes. 

Linda
