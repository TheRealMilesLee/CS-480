Mark I think we need to make the no response be something other than not allowing it.  Something such as:  I am not interested at this time. I do not wish to answer at this time ....  This will allow us to accept any yes and not have to worry about sending the company name if someone in the company says no.

Here is our first draft of the pop-up box language.  Please circulate among the appropriate members of your group and let Barbara or me know if you have any comments.  Language for the revised Password Application will follow.
