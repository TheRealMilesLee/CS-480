Gerald,
With Judy's departure from our group I have been asked to act as the liaison between the Upstream Desk and Legal. I understand that this is an outstanding issue.

After discussing with Nelson, he would like to include a clause stipulating that the three days is not a result of force majeure.

FYI...I have been waiting on Nelson to give me feedback. Rod from Mariner is waiting on a confirm.

Judy,  I added the language for release by Mariner that we discussed.  I put a 3 day threshold in the language.  Please review and lets discuss.
