Charles - I am preparing the November update for Jim, and was wondering if there are any new activities in the last few weeks that you would like to report to him.  I have attached your previous update, so if there have been any changes or new events please let me know. 

Thanks, Bryan

Charles - This is what I have, as of your Sept. 5th report.  Please make any changes, or additions/subtractions that you feel are necessary for the Oct.5th update.  Thanks for your help.
