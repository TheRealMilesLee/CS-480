Danny:

I read through Ron Abraham's consulting contract and wonder if we have the most current copy.  The term is for January 1,1992-December 31, 1992 and the signature page reflects 1991 dates.  I see the extension reference in the term clause but, did not see an addendum that reflected dates?  Am I on the right track, is this agreement current and in force as of today?  
There is no mention of termination of agreement other than death (that would be final), felony or refusal to perform duties. No out clause?
Hope this helps you.
