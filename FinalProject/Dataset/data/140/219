I agree that this represents our conversation of yesterday and should be submitted to the other teams.  Two small edits: Under "The Pipeline" (1)the sub heading should be "Receipt/Delivery Points" and (2) I would be more comfortable if "Toll" read "Illustrative Toll".  Bob Hill.

Hi folks,

Here is the draft proposal as discussed during our meeting yesterday.
Please review asap and provide me with your comments early this afternoon.
I will then revise accordingly and send to the greater commercial group at
the end of today.

Thx again,
Dave
