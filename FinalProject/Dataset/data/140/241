I just spoke to Elizabeth.  I told her that we would move her out of Trading Track and in to the Analyst pool.  I also told her about setting a performance plan going forward and that you would be contacting her.  She knows that she will be working as an Analyst for the west.
 
I will complete the plan and forward to you.
 
Mike
