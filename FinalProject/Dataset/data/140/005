Thanks Mitch.  I have 18 month old twins who could care less about my distractions.  They are my stress outlet now.  Happy Thanksgiving.

Thanks for the note Stan.  It is nice to know that with all of the distractions within our company lately you still recognize the things we should be thankful for.  I know you have your hands full with the current situation, but I hope you take time to enjoy the holidays with your family and friends as well.

Sincerely,
Mitch Meyer

As we approach the Thanksgiving Holiday, I want to take this opportunity to wish you and yours a safe and happy Holiday.  
With the recent events in our nation, giving thanks this year has taken on a whole new meaning.  This Thanksgiving we honor the brave, enduring heroes who gave their lives as well as those who are abroad fighting for freedom. We can be thankful for our great nation and for the world coming together. 
I recognize that here at Enron we are working through some challenging times and that everyone in the organization is working hard.  Thank you for your continued dedication.
Please take some time over the Holiday to enjoy your family and friends.   
Happy Thanksgiving.
Stan
