PROJECT ANNOUNCEMENT: THE CAEM GRID ENHANCEMENT FORUM
 
PROMPT REPLY REQUESTED.
 
A slew of new power control, management, transmission and storage
technologies are becoming available in the power marketplace to reduce
congestion, enhance performance and improve reliability.  These
technologies carry great promise for addressing some of the challenges
currently faced by regulators and market participants alike.  But there
appear to be significant institutional, regulatory and pricing barriers
to their widespread use.  In addition, the new technologies are likely
to present challenges of their own.
 
Accordingly, the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets
(CAEM—www.caem.org) is hosting a consensus-building forum designed to
(a) achieve a common understanding of the grid-enhancing potential of
the new technologies; (b) use an intensive role-reversal seminar to
identify and highlight the institutional, regulatory and market design
barriers to the successful deployment of the various new tools; and (c)
develop technology-neutral recommendations addressing these barriers.
 
The project will begin in early 2002 with final policy recommendations
to be published by Spring of 2002.  The project is expected to have a
significant impact on decisions made by regulators, financial analysts,
utility executives, the media and potential customers.
 
For a copy of the proposal, please e-mail Philip Marston, the Project
Director, at pmarston@marstonlaw.com.  This forum is time-sensitive and
the number of participants is limited.
