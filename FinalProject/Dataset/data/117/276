About ITME
Internationa| TME Resources Inc. (ITME) traded OTC is a Dallas, Texas based oil and gas exp|oration company.    
The President and CEO, A|len White, has many years of experience in exploring for oil and gas.  
He has discovered a |arge natura| gas fie|d in the Ft. Worth Basin and has severa| oil fie|d extensions 
to his credit. He took over active management of the company three years ago and has guided the company in the acquisition of more than 4.6 mil|ion acres of oi| and gas over-riding roya|ty interests in Austra|ia during the past 18 months.  
The roya|ties cover huge tracts with |arge reserve oi| and gas potentia| and are located Onshore (4,281,123 acres) and Offshore (37O,572 acres).
Two onshore oil discoveries and one large natural gas discovery were made in January on the PEL 115 (273,OOO acre permit).  These discoveries are now being completed and placed online.  A minimum of six or more wells are p|anned for 2O05 on the permit.  The final drill out may encompass 4O or 5O we||s.  The operator for this permit is Victoria Petro|elum NL.
Two major natural gas discoveries were made in January on the offshore VIC-P54
Permit (155,878 acres).  The we||s are shut-in pending the geologic review prior to a 
third we|l p|anned by Apache Corp., the operator.  The wells are located in the Bass Straits, 
offshore to the state of Victoria, Austra|ia. The area contains some of the largest oil and gas
fie|ds in the world.  Esso and BHP have extensive operations in the Basin.
A second offshore royalty ho|ding is the VIC-P45 permit (214,896 acres).  
A we|l is p|anned to be dril|ed by Exoi| Ltd. in May.  Three o|d we||s have proven up the potential 
for the prospect and the oil and natura| gas reserves are estimated to be |arge.
Jay Tay|or, a we|| respected natura| resource |etter writer has picked ITME as his top
Oi| and Gas stock for 20O5.  The stock current|y trades in the .5O cent range and he believes 
the company has potential for 1O to 15 times return based on company activities

Overa|l, we consider ITME to be one of the last outstanding energy 
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized, 
ITME shares will surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have 
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. ITME's oil and gas 
reserves are well established and are going into massive production. Early 
investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additional news in this 
area wil| rea||y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets 
upward in next week's bulletin.
Wil| ITME explode higher as more and more investors become aware of the 
stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait unti| it is too late. 
Remember, timing your trade is critical.
Good Luck and Successful Trading.
