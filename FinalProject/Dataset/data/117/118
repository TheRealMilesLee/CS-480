 From: Dr Mustapha Bello
ECO Bank,
Rue De Governeur Bayol, 
Cotonou, Benin.

Dear Sir,

RE: TRANSFER OF (USD 22 MILLION).

I am Dr Mustapha Bello, the director in charge of
Auditing and Accounting Department of Eco Bank
Benin, in West Africa, and also the account officer
of Late Mr.Hassan Balhas Ghadar, a Lebanese. Mr.Hassan
Balhas Ghadar was a Seasoned Contractor with Benin
Cement Company in Benin Republic, who unfortunately
died in the plane crash of Union Transport
Africaines(UTA) Flight Boeing 727 in Cotonou, Benin
Republic on 25th, December, 2003.


You may read more stories about the crash on
visiting these websites:

<http://english.pravda.ru/accidents/21/97/384/11653_Aircrash.html>

<http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash>


Before his death on the 25th December 2003,Mr.Ghadar
had a fixed deposit account with the bank and no other
person outside the bank knows about this account or
any thing concerning it. The account has no other
beneficiary and my investigation proved that his
supposed next of kin died along with him in the crash.
Since then I have made several enquiries to locate any
of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved
unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful
attempts, I decided to contact you. I am contacting
you to assist in transfering the money left behind
by my client to your nominated account before the
bank confiscates the fund.


Consequently, since l have been unsuccessful in
locating the relatives for over 5 weeks now. I seek
your consent, to present you as the next of kin of
the deceased so that the proceeds of this account
valued at US$22 million can be paid into your
account and thereafter you and l can share the
money.

70% to me and my colleagues and 30% to you. I will
arrange for all the necessary legal documents that can
be used to back up the claim. All I require is your
honest co-operation to enable us see this deal
through.


I guarantee that this deal will be executed under a
legitimate arrangement that will protect you and I
from any breach of the law. All documents of this
transaction shall be destroyed immediately we receive
this money leaving no trace to any place.


If this proposal is acceptable to you, kindly email
the following information to me:
a. Complete names and address.
b. Private telephone number.
c. Private fax number.
d. Private email.

Until you write,have a nice day and God bless.

Yours faithfully,
Dr Mustapha Bello
