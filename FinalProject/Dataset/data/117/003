Ray,
The $958mm that Louise refers to on her slide is the sum of Sched C 09/27 ($667M) and Sched D 09/27 ($291M)..

The last schedule, 3Q01 Rolling Schedule C, is what we show Andersen, and includes EES Wholesale Sched C, which is not included in the schedules below (they're just North America). Please let me know if you need them and I'll try and track them down. 

Please call if you need any additional information. I'm  at x30352. Thanks!
