Bill,

FYI.  Now, our Law Manager system is only as current as the information that we are given.  It is possible that there are suits or claims out there involving Foti.  If you want to do complete due diligence, I would suggest that you contact the three following litigation managers:  Andrew Edison, Richard Sanders, and Bob Williams.

Good hunting.

Britt

	Bill Rapp, an ETS attorney, has asked that we do a  Law Manager database search to determine whether David Foti shows up as a party or otherwise.  Mr. Foti is apparently being considered as a consultant by ETS.  Could you please run a search and reply by e-mail when you are finished?  Thanks.

	Britt
