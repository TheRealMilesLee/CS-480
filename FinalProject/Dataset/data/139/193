As per my voice mail message sent today, please find enclosed the new Credit Policy being proposed by SPP (to be effective December 15). I would like to go over this document with you to identify:
	-	Commercially relevant changes, if any
	-	Changes in the information flow between Enron and SPP (i.e. they require communication regarding material changes 		in financial conditions, downgrade of short term debt rating, etc.)
	-	Identify who else should be involved in this discussion (i.e. Christi suggested Bill Bradford)

I will be in the office on Tuesday and Wednesday. Or from Monday (after 11am) on.
