Ok.  I'm in.  We can invite cute boys and sit on their laps.  What time is the game?

Suz,

I say lets do it! and so does Terri.  I will make Rotel dip and other stuff too.  I think it will be fun - and maybe we can carry the party to the hood after!  Keep me posted on how your day is going.  I kind of hope you get to go today to see your fam.  

K.

Kim!  Good to hear from you.  I could use that beer right now!  My weekend
was busy (holiday shopping, etc.)  Did you do anything fun?  RE:  the party,
I would have the party at my place, but I have a one bedroom apt. (not
conducive to parties).  Tell Suzanne that it will all work out!  We need to
get this thing planned, and soon!

I am heading to Tennessee on Wednesday.  I hope it's cold there, I'm ready
for some winter weather... Dallas sounds nice, I hope you have a great time.
Have a safe and happy Thanksgiving!!!!

Terri,

What's going on and how was your weekend?  We are still working on the
TN/FLA party - Suzanne is worried about enough places for people to sit -
but I say she shouldn't worry - just have a lot of beer!  Are you going to
see PH over the holiday?  Don't know for sure what I am doing yet -
thinking about going to Dallas - gotta work out the logistics though.
Let's get together for a beer soon -

Kim
