Hey guys, 

I need to let you guys know what is going on with the desk. The winter is fast approaching and it will be cold soon, and OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE MONEY WILL PRESENT themselves. We have some very young talent on the desk, so we need to work extra hard to get ourselves prepared! The money has slowed down on the physical side, and we need to continue to work the relationships in anticipation of the winter. We need to hit the phones extra hard in the weeks to come. Please make sure you have access to all the oasis sites and become very familiar with what it takes to move power region to region. I don't want to miss a blow-out day because someone on the desk is unfamiliar with a region or hasn't done that specific transaction. I want everyone to continue to work new deals, however if it doesn't make sense, get out of it, make it work, or use that relationship to help you out when your in trouble down the road. From November 15 - February 15 of last year, we made close to 2 millions dollars. It might be slow now, but we need to minimize the mistakes, and make some money.

Let me know if you have any questions.
