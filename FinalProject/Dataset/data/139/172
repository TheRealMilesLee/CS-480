<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; Hello Rick. I didn't get a chance to tell you in person - Thank You. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; It meant alot to me and I'm sure everyone else on how you handled 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; Enron's "issues" and the Sept. 11th event. I think this showed to me 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; your true compassion and explains the loyalty that your employees have 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; for you. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; When I grow up, I want to be just like you. :-) 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; Again, Thanks and it was very much appreciated. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; Melinda
