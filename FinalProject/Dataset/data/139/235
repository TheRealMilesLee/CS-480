Julie,

Attached is ENA's proposal addressing the commercial terms to supply gas to the Rio Bravo IV power plant.  We are looking forward to discussing this in more detail during our conference call this afternoon.

Please provide your fax number and I will send/fax a signed proposal to your attention, ASAP.
