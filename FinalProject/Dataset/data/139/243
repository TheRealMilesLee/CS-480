i'm finer and finer, and still not with a jobjob but
not really wanting a jobjob, too scared of going back
to hi-tech, and falling in love with my job, and
getting laid off again, must be some kind of fear of
intimacy problem..... but i'll probably want to get
real intimate again as soon as the $$$$ runs
out....... going to seattle for thanksgiving at
kevin's, 35 people this year, yay, and lots of little
cute kids running around, and, well, i couldn't sleep
last night and tossed and turned and finally fell
asleep at 6 or so and missed my yoga class at 9....
this is my life, and it ain't have bad.... no no
no.... i hear pp got a job, yay and cool and good for
her... x0, happy thanksgiving, and good luck
whethering the merger....
