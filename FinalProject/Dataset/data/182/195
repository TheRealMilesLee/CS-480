I have a couple of questions Jerry, however I think they would  be easier to discuss over the phone.  I will  be back in the office next week so maybe we can hook up.

FYI,

Hey guys the attached report has the outages related to the Red Rock expansion. I asked Ron, if you guys could take a look at the estimated flow affect you see in the highlighted boxes. The reason is, because I moved unit 401's overhaul into March. The same time period we are doing the tie-ins for Station 1 & 3. The hope is to reduce the total throughput loss, and also reduce the down time. I talked with Jan Moore and told her there will probably be a modification of the affected flows.

Thanks

Jerry
