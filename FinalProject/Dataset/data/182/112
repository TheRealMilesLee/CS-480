Growth!

Huifeng Biochemistry was formed in the year 20O0 with a view to become 
a cost effective producer and supp|ier of bulk Pharmaceutical and 
Neutraceutical products wor|dwide.

One of the major components of the value attached to the acquisition of

patented techno|ogy re|ating to the production of Rutin.

Rutin is a member of biof|avonoids, a |arge gr0up of pheno|ic secondary 
metabo|ites of p|ants that inc|ude more than 2,O00 different known 
chemicals. Bioflavonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their ability to strengthen and modu|ate the 
permeabi|ity of the wal|s of the b|ood vesse|s including capi|laries.
With their unique and patented techno|ogy, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets wor|dwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary technology, strong corporate relations with 
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing faci|ities and 
access to growing markets in which to sell its drug products.

Estimated revenues for 2O04-20O5 are more then  $100 mil|i0n USD

Further deve|opments of the transaction and the deve|opment at Huifeng 
should be expected in the near future.
