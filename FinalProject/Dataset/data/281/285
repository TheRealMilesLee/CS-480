History has recorded the appearance and deeds of many religious leaders: Moses,
Jesus Christ and Abraham, to name just a few. There have also been many
self-proclaimed prophets and messengers, each of whom has claimed to bring a
divine revelation for mankind. Some have proven to be false, and others have
been forgotten. But there is one religious leader who stands alone, an
unlettered man who transmitted a revelation from God that literally changed the
course of history and the destinies of a major portion of mankind: Muhammad, the
Prophet and Messenger of God.<br>
<br>
ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA confirms:<br>
&quot;...a mass of detail in the early sources shows that he was an honest and
upright man who had gained the respect and loyalty of others who were likewise
honest and upright men.&quot; (Vol. 12)<br>
BERNARD SHAW said about him:<br>
&quot;He must be called the Saviour of humanity I believe that if a man like him
were to assume the dictatorship of the modern world, he would succeed in solving
its problems in a way that would bring it much needed peace and happiness.&quot;
(The Genuine Islam, Singapore, Vol. 1, No. X 1936)<br>
<br>
He was by far the most remarkable man that ever set foot on this earth. He
preached a religion, founded a state, built a nation, laid down a moral code,
initiated numerous social and political reforms, established a powerful and
dynamic society to practice and represent his teachings, and completely
revolutionized the worlds of human thought and behaviour for all time to come.<br>
<br>
&quot;HIS NAME IS MOHAMMED&quot;<br>
May the Peace of God Be upon Him (PBUH)<br>
Born in Arabia in the year 570 CE, Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) started
his mission of preaching Islam, the religion of truth and the submission of man
to one God, at the age of forty and died at the age of sixty-three. During the
short twenty-three year period of his prophethood, Muhammad changed the entire
Arabian Peninsula forever. Within the space of one generation, the vast majority
of people went from paganism and idolatry to devout and strict monotheism, from
tribal quarrels and wars to national solidarity and cohesion, from drunkenness
and debauchery to sobriety and piety, from lawlessness and anarchy to a
lifestyle characterized by discipline, from moral bankruptcy to the highest
standards of moral excellence. Human history has never seen such a complete
transformation of a people or a place before or since—and just IMAGINE that
all of these unbelievable wonders took place in JUST OVER TWO DECADES and
because of the efforts of one man. The renowned historian Lamartine, when
speaking on the essentials of human greatness, wonders: &quot;If greatness of
purpose, smallness of means and astounding results are the three criteria of
human genius, who could dare to compare any great man in modern history with
Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)? The most famous men created arms, laws and
empires only they founded, if anything at all, no more than material powers
which often crumbled away before their eyes. This man moved not only armies,
legislation, empires, peoples and dynasties but millions of men in one-third of
the then-inhabited world; and more than that, he moved the altars, the gods, the
religions, the ideas, the beliefs and souls.... his forbearance in victory, his
ambition, which was entirely devoted to one idea and in no manner striving for
an empire; his endless prayers; his supplications to God; his death and his
triumph after death; all these attest not to an imposture but to a firm
conviction which gave him the power to restore a dogma. This dogma was two-fold:
the unity of God and the immateriality of God-the former telling what God is,
the latter telling what God is not; the one overthrowing false gods with the
sword, the other starting an idea with the words. Philosopher, orator, apostle,
legislator, warrior, conqueror of ideas, restorer of rational dogmas, of a cult
without images, the founder of twenty terrestrial empires and of one spiritual
empire: that is PROPHET MUHAMMAD (peace be upon him). As regards all the
standards by which human greatness may be measured, we may well ask IS THERE ANY
MAN GREATER THAN HE?&quot;<br>
(Lamartine: Histoire de la Turquie, Paris, 1854Vol.11, pp 276-277).<br>
<br>
The world has had its share of great personalities. But these were one-sided
figures who distinguished themselves in only one or two fields, such as
religious thought or military leadership. The lives and teachings of these great
personalities are shrouded in the mists of time. There is so much speculation
about the time and place of their birth, the mode and style of their life, the
nature and detail of their teachings, and the degree and measure of their
success or failure that it is impossible for humanity to reconstruct accurately
the lives and teachings of these men.<br>
Not so this man The Prophet Muhammad accomplished so much in so many fields of
human thought and behaviour in the fullest blaze of human history. Every detail
of his private life and public utterances has been accurately documented and
faithfully preserved to our day. The authenticity of the records so preserved
are vouched for not only by the faithful followers but even by his prejudiced
critics. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was a religious teacher, a social
reformer, a moral guide, an administrative colossus, a faithful friend, a
wonderful companion, a devoted husband, a loving father—all in one. No other
man in history ever excelled or equalled him in any of these different aspects
of life— but it was only for the selfless personality of Prophet Muhammad
(peace be upon him) to achieve such incredible perfection. Mahatma Gandhi,
speaking on the character of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), says in Young
India: &quot;I wanted to know the best of one who holds today undisputed sway
over the hearts of millions of mankind....I became more than convinced that it
was not the sword that won a place for Islam in those days in the scheme of
life. It was the rigid simplicity, the utter self-effacement of the Prophet, the
scrupulous regard for his pledges, his intense devotion to his friends and
followers, his intrepidness, his fearlessness, his absolute trust in God and in
his own mission. These and not the sword carried everything before them and
surmounted every obstacle. When I closed the 2nd volume (of the Prophet's
biography) I was sorry there was not more for me to read of the great
life.&quot; Thomas Carlyle, in his Heroes and Hero-worship, was simply amazed as
to &quot;how one man single-handedly could weld tribes and wandering Bedouins
into a most powerful and civilized nation in less than two decades.&quot; Diwan
Chand Sharma wrote: &quot;Muhammad was the soul of kindness and his influence
was felt and never forgotten by those around him. &quot;<br>
(D. C. Sharma, The Prophets of the East, Calcutta 1935, pp. 12)<br>
<br>
Edward Gibbon and Simon Ockley, speaking on the profession of Islam wrote:
&quot;I believe in one God, and Mahomet, a Apostle of God&quot; is the simple
and invariable profession of Islam. The intellectual image of the Deity has
never been degraded by any visible idol; the honour of the Prophet has never
transgressed the measure of human virtues; and his living precepts have
restrained the gratitude of his disciples within the bounds or reason and
religion.&quot; (History of the Saracen Empires, London, 1870, p. 54). Muhammad
was nothing more or less than a human being but he was a man with a noble
mission, one which was to unite all human beings on the worship of the one and
only God and to teach them the way to honest and upright living based on the
commands of God. He always described himself as &quot;a servant and messenger of
God,&quot; and every single one of his actions proclaimed loudly the truth of
this phrase.<br>
<br>
Speaking on the aspect of equality before God in Islam, the famous Indian
poetess Sarojini Naidu says: &quot;It was the first religion that preached and
practiced democracy for, in the mosque when the call for prayer is sounded and
worshippers are gathered together, the democracy of Islam is embodied five times
a day when the peasant and king kneel side by side and proclaim: &quot;God Alone
is Great.&quot; I have been struck over and over again by this indivisible unity
of Islam that makes man instinctively a brother. (S. Naidu, &quot;Ideals of
Islam,&quot; vide Speeches ~ Writings, Madras, 1918, p. 169). In the words of
Prof. Hurgronje: &quot;The League of Nations founded by the prophet of Islam put
the principle of international unity and human brotherhood on such universal
foundations as to show candle to other nations ... the fact is that no nation of
the world can show a parallel to what Islam has done towards the realization of
the idea of the League of Nations. &quot;The world has not hesitated to raise to
divinity individuals whose lives and missions have been lost in legend.
Historically speaking, none of these legends achieved even a fraction of what
Muhammad accomplished. And all of his striving was for the sole purpose of
uniting mankind for the worship of the one God on the codes of moral excellence.
Muhammad or his followers never at any time claimed that he was a son of God, a
God-incarnate, or a man having a divine nature-he always was and is even today
considered as only a human messenger chosen by God.<br>
<br>
Michael H. Hart, in his recently published book on the rating of individuals who
have contributed towards the benefit and advancement of mankind writes: &quot;My
choice of Muhammad to lead the list of the world's most influential persons may
surprise some readers and may be questioned by others, but he was the only man
in history who was supremely successful on both the religious and secular
levels. (MH. Hart, The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in
History, New York, 1978, pp. 33) Today even after a lapse of fourteen century,
the life and teachings of Muhammad have survived without the slightest loss,
alteration, or interpolation. They offer the same undying hope for treating
mankind's many ills that they did when he was alive. This is not a claim of
Muhammad's followers but also the inescapable conclusion reached by a critical
and unbiased study of human history. Maybe it is time for you to get to know
this outstanding person who has influenced the life of billions of people over
the last fourteen<br>
hundred years. He could also change your life.<br>
