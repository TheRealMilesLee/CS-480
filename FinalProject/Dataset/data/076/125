Dear Mr Mark E  Haedicke

Welcome to Part 2 of Asia Power 2002's trilogy emails, weekly updates featuring the highlight, people and issues to expect at Asia's largest, distinguished and most established senior level power forum.

We're all aware that power projects run into the billions and while the potential for revenue is evident, so too is the immediate need for capital to support these mega deals. Power project financiers play a key role in these projects and are the key drivers for project development. 

Asia Power 2002 brings you face-to-face with the leading project financiers to talk about their experience, expectations and vision for power project financing in Asia. What are their key considerations and priorities as they evaluate whether to support power projects around the region? 

Interested in hearing the views of ADB, JBIC, ICICI, IDBI, IFC and ABN AMRO? Come on down to Asia Power 2002 as they share with you cutting-edge information on their project financing deliberations. Get all this and more valuable networking, at one place and at one time!
