FROM THE DESK OF
BARRISTER KINGSLEY GOLD 
SOLICITORS & ADVOCATES
LONDON,U.K.

Dear Friend,

  I write you in good faith, hoping that you will treat this letter as 
a desperate search for assistance in a matter that shall benefit both 
of us. A random search based on your locality from the Internet produced 
your name and address and that of two others in your country. 
 
 I am KINGSLEY GOLD an Attorney to a deceased Immigrant property 
magnate who was based in the U.K., also referred to as my client.On the 25th 
of July 2000, my client, his wife and their two Children died in the 
Air France concord plane crash bound for New York in their plan for a 
world cruise,  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm 
 
Since then I have been managing his properties here in the U.K. and 
some others which he put out for sale. The properties which have long been 
put out on sale have now been paid for and now the money paid has long 
been deposited into his local bank account here. I have contacted you 
to assist in repatriating the
money and estate left behind by my client before they get
confisticated or declared unserviceable by his bank.
 
 Particularly, the bank has issued me with a notice to provide any of 
his next of kin or have the account confisticated within a short period 
of time. my late  client has an account valued at 6.5 Million United 
States Dollars Only. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating any of my 
clients relatives for some time now and with no one coming forward 
since my clients passing on, and with the bank now giving me a deadline, I 
now seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to my deceased 
client, so that the proceeds of his account valued at 6.5 Million 
United
States Dollars Only can be paid to you. This I intend we share amongst 
ourselves in the ratio of 50% to me and 40% for you while the balance 
10% we shall use for settling any miscellaneous expenses that might 
arise.
 
 I have all the necessary information that can be used to back up any 
Claim that we may make and I can assure you that you shall be paid this 
amount as the next of kin to my late client.
 
 All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal 
through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate 
arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Trust me as 
his attorney that this is a risk-free relationship. Please get in touch 
with me via email and send me
your full names and address, telephone and fax numbers to
enable us discuss further about this transaction.
 
Best regards,
KINGSLEY GOLD
NB: Please reply only to my personal email 
address(kingsgold_esq@mail2world.com) for confidentiality.
