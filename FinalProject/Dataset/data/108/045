Dear Andrew, 	
Halloween is only two days away!

We have bears dressed in costumes, sweets, gourmet goodies, decorations for the home and Halloween arrangements for your favorite ghosts and goblins. Don't scream! You can still be the hit of Halloween! 

And with holiday shopping on the horizon, look no further for this year's hottest gift!
