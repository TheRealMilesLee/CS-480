Jeff,
Let us know If you have suggestions on a replacement. This is the second year in a row Kevin has backed out on interviewing at the last minute.  If we can't find anyone, we'll have to interview fewer people.  The replacement would need to fly to Phila Monday night and would get back late on Tue night.
