Dear Ms. Causholli,

TAD equals to through-air-drying, a process where hot air is blown in a drum 
through the paper web and drying it. It allows a higher bulk of tissue paper as 
the paper web is not pressed hard against iron as in the case of conventional 
drying. Higher bulk means softer paper and better absorbency properties, 
therefore it is prefeered by companies aiming at very high tissue quality. I am 
not a technical expert but machinery manufacturers, especially Metso Paper's 
Honeycomb division in the USA could explain TAD in more technical terms.

AfH stands for away-from-home, i.e. uses in offices, industry, hotels, 
restaurants, hospitals etc. outside households.

I have not yet updated all the 2000 numbers but will do it within the 
next couple of months. Some data is very difficult to obtain, and thus updating 
takes a lot of time.


Best regards
