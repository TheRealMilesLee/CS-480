Then you must order Extra-Time Now!... Here's Why: Extra-Time is the only =
male sexual performance formula that, not only stops premature ejaculation=
, but actually "cures" it. Extra-Time is the only product that allows "YOU=
" to control when you ejaculate.

Since 1997, Extra-Time has been ranked #1 for a very good reason ... "It W=
orks"! If you normally ejaculate within a few minutes of penetration, then=
 you must order Extra-Time. You'll last 5 to 10 minutes longer, the very f=
irst night..... GUARANTEED! 


Premature Ejaculation Can Ruin a Relationship. 
Premature ejaculation occurs when you ejaculate too quickly and without co=
ntrol. It occurs before or shortly after penetration. Premature ejaculatio=
n interferes with the sexual pleasure of both you and your partner. It cau=
ses feelings of guilt, embarrassment, frustration, and depression. Prematu=
re ejaculation will cause stress in even the healthiest relationship.
