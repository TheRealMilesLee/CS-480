Hi Shelley,

We were at Tracey and Rex's for dinner this evening.  Tracey told me about 
"Willie."  I'm sorry about that but I know you said he was really getting old 
and feeble.  It is very difficult, though, losing a pet.  Bet poor "Wiley" is 
lost without his buddy.

Let me know when you get your box of "goodies."

Love,
Mom
