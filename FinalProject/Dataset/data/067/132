Dear e-gold user.
My name Victor.
In the present time I have such e-gold acc#, given below,  VERIFIED in 
E-gold. Ltd. That is, I sent in the letter to the manager e-gold, given of 
the passport certified by the notary. On these accounts IS NOT IMPOSED 
Limite Balance.
I since 2000 work with system e-gold and I can you convince that e-gold 
admin does not
impose Balance Limit on accounts at which number begin on 1 *****, 2 ***** 
and 3 *****, 4***** as they were open TILL September 11, 2001. All e-gold of 
accounts open after this date, can be exposed Balance Limit. If in them the 
information on the user who has opened them does not suffice. All accounts 
the histories of operations have no. I count, that  Old numbers of the 
accounts are necessary to you to raise trust of the  players to you.  
Besides you can use these e-gold acc# In the following projects.
I can offer them to you:
