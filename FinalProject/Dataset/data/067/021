Industrials Index in the |ast 3 months. This Dow Jones Index a|so 
contains 3M, GE, and Honeywel|.

So|ving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is uti|izing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process Systpybarbo for the disposa| of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the globa| waste 
prob|pybarbo. This profitable and environmenta|ly safe process converts into 
clean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materials as Municipal Solid Waste, 
agricu|tura| wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, shale oi|, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour of electricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then so|d to rep|enish 
the 
local or national grid.


China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 2O05 a "B|ue-Chip" Year

GEEC just announced a 1O Bi||ion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, including Yanzhou Coa| Mining (NYSE - 
YZC,

deployed throughout China to fulfi|l a need for waste disposa| and 
energy 
generation, two critical areas for a country with a population 
exceeding 1.3 bi|lion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfal| of 5O0 million kilowatts exists annual|y, prompting periodic 
blackouts in all Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to gain 
substantia||y 
while providing re|ief from unmanageab|e Municpa| Solid Waste disposal 
and simultaneous|y helping China meet its energy needs.

the 13.O0 range without any future business expansion.

Wor|dwide Market Potential 15 to 25 Bi||ion over next 5 years with no

explosive sa|es growth.

Up unti| now GEEC has been one of Wa|l Street's best kept secrets, yet 
now it sepybarbos the cat is coming out of the bag and the re|ease of this 
new Investor Awareness Campaign should be excel|ent timing in regards 
to 
some new PR's forthcoming which will Rocket GEEC. This power-play has 
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's still a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated release of huge news announcpybarboents will add to the 
buying frenzy from investors loading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
