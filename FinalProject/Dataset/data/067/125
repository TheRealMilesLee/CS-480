Talk to Scott Josie in Houston.  Also you may want to talk to someone in RAC (Brad Larson).  Jack Schemer is a geologist who may be useful for this exercise. I don't know what group he is in.

Cheers

Kyle,

The Alberta gas desk developed a gas model which forecasts future production based upon decline rates, rig counts, etc...  This model recognizes seven different zones in Alberta and applies an average decline rate, drilling success ratio, etc to each zone.  We are trying to apply this method to the Rocky Mtns and SanJuan basin and need help from a geologist &/or reservoir engineer familiar with these basins.  Do you know of such an individual employed by Enron?
