Have you adjusted the 07/01 for FUGG yet?  I was just wondering
what kind of time frame you are looking at.  We have an interconnect
between WIC and FUGG for 07/01 for 28,481.  

Also,  what about the unify imbalance problem with FUGG that
we discussed while you were here?  

If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know.  
I was wondering if it would help you if I actualized the current
months, if that would allow you to have time to work on the 
past problems.  
Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria
