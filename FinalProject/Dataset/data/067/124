You are right-it should be 24.5 hours remaining as you used 24 hours in this last pay period (there is no "religious holiday" category so that went against vacation time.  I had to check with John Blaylock again.

Per John Blaylock in HR,  you have 48.50 hours left (you had 160 - including 40 carryover- and used all but the 48.5)

Joanne:  I'm having trouble checking on this.  Can you tell me how much vacation time I have used in 2001?  Thanks.  Sara
