Hey Martin this is Vassigh Willy D's friend.
I just started a project here at Enron this week.

I am working with the Global Settlements group on the 18th floor.

My phone extension is 5-8679 just thru tomorrow.  I am out of the office Thur and Friday and will get my permanent seat next week.

This project is going thru at Least Next August - so we should go to lunch sometime.

Let me know

Late
Brian
