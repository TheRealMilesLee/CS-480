The decision has been made based on the latest smartpig results that the operating pressure for the pipeline section from Station 8 to Station 6 is not to exceed 939 psi until the actual status of the pipeline can be evaluated based upon the smartpig information and any necessary repairs can be made.

Additionally, a conference call for Friday (2-15) at 2:PM CST has been established to initiate discussions regarding excavations and possible repairs that may be needed.  Conference number is 877-795-3687 Code 724709.

Everyone plz try to participate in this call if at all possible.

Max Brown
