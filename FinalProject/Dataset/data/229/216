Near the outskirts of the city appeared a high tower, upon the flat roof of
which a man was engaged in adjusting a telescope. Upon seeing Rob, who was
passing at no great distance from this tower, the man cried out:
APPROCHEZ!--VENEZ ICI! Then he waved his hands frantically in the air, and
fairly danced with excitement

Frenchman, whose eyes were actually protruding from their sockets, he asked,
coolly: Well, what do you want? The other was for a moment speechless.
