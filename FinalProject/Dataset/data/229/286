Dear Friend,

Good day to you. I may have to trouble your sense of personal achievement and reward for an opportunity properly taken advantage of.

I am Mr. Michael Ramsey, a representative and attorney to Kenneth Lay, the former chairman & CEO, Enron Corp. Industry: Energy &Natural Resources Home, presently in jail and facing trial on charges of corruption and embezzlement of funds while in Power. He deposited ($21,000,000.00) with me when he was in power as the chairman. 

I am contacting you because I want you to deal with the Finance house and claim the money on my behalf since I have declared that the Funds belong to my foreign business partner. You shall also be required to assist me in investment in your country. I hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will not sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me properly, share in this percentage, 60% to me and 40% to you. When I receive your positive response I will give you viable information relating to this project i.e. the Finance institution where the money was deposited and the required documentation that will enable you lay claims to the funds, which is very important. What I need is for you to indicate your interest that you will assist us by receiving the money on my behalf in Europe. For this, you shall be considered to be the beneficiary to the funds. The project in brief, is that the funds with which we intend to carry out our proposed investments in your country, is presently in the custody of a bank in Europe. I do not want the government of my Country to know about the money because they will believe I got the money from the sales of Enron stock when he was the Chairman & C.E.O.of Enron 

Once I have your details in full, the finance institution will contact you for Release of the funds to your account. As soon as payment is effected, and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred into your account, I intend to use my own share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this too you shall also be the overseas manager of all our properties and you will be paid based on a certain percentage agreed on by both parties. I guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me urgently by E-mail:m231r101@faithmail.com. I am presently in LONDON. 

Please, provide me the following:
1. Full Name
2. Your Telephone Number and Fax Number
3. Your Contact Address. 

Best Regards,

Michael Ramsey.
