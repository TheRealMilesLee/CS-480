A logo is a tool that you use to: Have your customers remember you (the logo of an apple reminds you of a company).  Have your customers associate you with the quality of your service or product (when you see a whirlpool logo on a product you associate quality to it or maybe not).  Have your customers associate your services or products to you (when you think of two golden arches, you think of a company with its products and services).  When we create your unique logo we'll ask you simple but important questions, so that your logo is an image that will last for your needs.
