Dear Jess,

It's February and love is in the air at Palm. . . 

Cupid is searching high and low for the perfect 
Valentine's Day gift. We recommend that he check out 
the new Palm(tm) i705 handheld. It offers the ultimate 
in "always-on" email and Palm i705 handheld users will
receive access to the AOL(r) Instant Messenger(tm) 
service. The Palm(tm) i705 handheld Travel and Mobility
bundles are two of the Palm Store sweetheart specials.

for the old video arcade days with these action-packed

Also on the topic of loved ones, Cupid was thrilled 
to learn that Palm is simplifying prevention and 
treatment for patients and doctors alike. Our user 
stories point to some of the other ways people are 
staying healthy with the help of their Palm handhelds. 

Have a great Valentine's Day!
