Hi Kim,

Just a note to see if you are still there at Enron.

I have gotten many e-mails back, mostly the tech guys, including Vince.

But I don't remember having got e-mails back from you, so maybe you are
still there.

If so, I certainly wish you the best in whatever direction you
ultimately take.

Obviously, Transwestern is an important pipeline and will continue to
operate.

If we can be of help at any time in the future after the dust finally
settles, please let me know.

Stay in touch!

Thanks,

Bob Brooks
