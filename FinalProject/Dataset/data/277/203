heigh They were just reaching the dammed-up stream on their way to the
starting point. Several of the riders were in front and several behind, when
suddenly Vronsky heard the sound of a horse galloping in the behind him, and
he was overtaken by Makhotin on his white-legged, lop-eared Gladiator.
Makhotin smiled, showing his long teeth, but Vronsky looked at him angrily.

was a large four-versta ring in the form of an ellipse in front of the
pavilion. On this course nine obstacles had been arranged: the stream, a big
and solid barrier two arsheenes high, just before the pavilion, a dry ditch,
a ditch full of water, a precipitous slope, an Irish barricade (one of the
most difficult obstacles, consisting of a mound fenced with brushwood,
beyond which was a ditch out of sight for the horses, so that the horse had

with water, and one dry one; and the end of the race was just facing the
pavilion. But the race began not in the ring, but a hundred arsheenes away
from it, and in that part of the course was the first obstacle, a dammed-up
stream, three arsheenes in breadth, which the racers could leap or wade
through as they preferred.  amed with oyster-shells;
