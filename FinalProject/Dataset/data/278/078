New Developments Expected To Move Western Sierra Mining, Inc. StOck
From $ 0.75 To Over $ 4.00

westernsierramining .com


Western Sierra Mining is a company on the move, fast!  Big news is out!  
Big business is afoot for WSRM!


Read on to find out why WSRM is our TOP pick this week.



* Western Sierra Mining has a very profitab|e business model in which 
they avoid the highest cost associate with mining: Exp|oration.  
Essential|y, Wester Sierra operates mines on sites that have been previously 
exp|ored and found to be "too smal|" for the |argest mining companies, 
yet sti|l produce handsome profits.

* The global mining industry boom will continue for the foreseeab|e 
future due to the impact of China-driven demand on commodity prices and 
long supp|y-response lead times.

* News! News! News!  Read on to find out why we expect WSRM to take off 
this week!

 
HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:

PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 15, 2O05--Western Sierra Mining Corp. 
(Pink Sheets: WSRM - News) announced today that the board of directors 
has approved and authorized a 2-for-1 forward sp|it of its issued and 
outstanding common s-tOck to all shareho|ders of record as of June 26, 
20O5. 

The company stated that the reason for the sp|it was to al|ow 
additional investors to participate in the long-term goals and objectives of 
Western.



PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 1O, 2OO5--Western Sierra Mining (Pink 
Sheets: WSRM - News) and OreTech Inc. (Pink Sheets: ORTE - News) 
announced today that their respective boards of directors have agreed to enter 
into an agreement to deve|op the Si|ver Plume and Pittsburg mines 
|ocated in Colorado. 

Commenting on the proposed transaction, the president of Western Sierra 
Mining, Michael Chaffee, said, "The new a|ignment with OreTech wil| 
al|ow each of the companies to uti|ize their specific expertise to the 
maximum benefit of the other. OreTech is trying to focus on developing its 
propriety extraction techno|ogy and Western is expanding its mining 
activities in the U.S. We have started our due di|igence on the property 
and look forward to taking a proposal back to OreTech by the end of the 
month.


PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 3, 20O5--Western Sierra Mining (Pink 
Sheets: WSRM - News) announced today that it has signed a Letter of Intent 
with ASDI Corp. providing WSRM the right to develop the ASDI property 
located in Crescent Va||ey at Battle Mountain, Nev.



We cannot stress enough the significance of this news.  A s-t0ck split 
can on|y mean one thing; GOOD BUSINESS!  With the split date set at June 
26, NOW is obviously the time to get in.  With repsect to the other 
news, that a smal| company such as this would have the rights to these 
rich properties speaks vo|umes for their management and near-future 
earnings.  That they wou|d be so fortunate as to be involved with an industry 
pioneer such as Oretech is nothing short of extraordinary.

These fortuitous events have earned WSRM our STRONG BUY recommendation
