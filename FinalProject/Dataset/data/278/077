MR ISSAC HONAMA
PROPERTY & LEASE MANAGERS
26 KESINGTON COURT LONDON,
ENGLAND.

Dear Friend,

I write you in good faith, hoping that you will treat this letter as a desperate search
for assistance in a matter that shall benefit both of us. A random search based on your
locality from the Internet produced your name and address, Please i apologise for this
medium of contact as it appears the only definate way i can have assistance with this
matter.

I am ISSAC HONAMA a property Manager to a deceased Immigrant property magnate who was
based in the U.K., also referred to as my client.

On Monday, 31 July, 2000, 13:22 GMT 14:22 UK , my client, his wife and their two
Children died in the Air France concord plane crash bound for New York in their plan
for a world cruise,

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm

I have been managing his properties here in the U.K. and some others which he put out
for sale. The properties which have long been put out on sale have now been paid for
and now the money paid has long been deposited into his local bank account here. I have
contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and estate left behind by my client
before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by his bank. Particularly, the
bank has issued me with a notice to provide any of his next of kin or have the account
confiscated within a short period of time.

My late client has an account valued at 18 Million United States Dollars Only. Since I
have been unsuccessful in locating any of my clients relatives for some time now and
with no one coming forward since my clients passing on, and with the bank now giving me a deadline, I now seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to my deceased client, so that the proceeds of his account valued at 18 Million United States Dollars Only can be paid to you. This I intend we share amongst ourselves in the ratio of 50% to me and 40% for you while the balance 10% we shall use for settling any miscellaneous expenses that might arise. I have all the necessary information that can be used to back up any Claim that we may make and I can assure you that you shall be paid this
amount as the next of kin to my late client.

All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Trust me as his Manager of his Estates, as i have all the needed information, that this is a risk-free relationship.

Please get in touch with me via email: issachonama@gmail.com, if you are interested in
helping me, so that we can discuss and i can send to you additional details.

Best regards,

Issac Honama.
