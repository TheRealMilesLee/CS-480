SWISS Pharm INT is a healthcare company with a uniquely broad spectrum of innovative solutions. 
For more than 5 years, we have been active in the discovery, development, manufacture and marketing
of novel healthcare solutions. Our products and services address prevention, diagnosis and treatment 
of diseases, thus enhancing well-being and quality of life.
We have reached big sales volume of pharmaceuticals in central ASIA and now we are trying to penetrate
the USA and European market.
Our focus is not just the diagnosis and treatment of manifest disease. The integrated healthcare approach
 is increasingly offering ways of identifying and targeting diseases early, when their damaging effects 
can still be prevented.
Arranged in two operative divisions, our global mission today and tomorrow is to create exceptional added
 value in healthcare. These two units are:

Pharmaceuticals.
Diagnostics.

SWISS Pharm INT aims to supply products and services that significantly improve people's lives by helping
to prevent, diagnose and treat disease.
SWISS Pharm INT is committed to a system of corporate governance that conforms to the latest standards and 
takes due account of our corporate development. The safety and health of our employees and the public, as well 
as the protection of our neighbourhoods and the environment, have high priority at all Group facilities. In all 
we do, we are guided by the principle of sustainable development.

SWISS Pharm INT pioneering approach to healthcare innovation enables us to deliver significant benefits to patients
 as well as to healthcare providers and systems. In our vision of the future, therapies will be available for many 
of today's untreatable diseases, it will be possible to optimize drug efficacy and safety, and effective strategies
 will be in place for preventing disease. Early diagnosis and improved new treatments will significantly reduce the 
need for expensive surgical operations and long hospital stays.

While this vision is an aspiration for the future, SWISS Pharm INT has begun pioneering the path, with a wide range
 of products and services available to:

-determine disease predisposition
-provide health information that can be acted upon to prevent or delay the onset of illness
-diagnose disease
-treat numerous diseases and conditions
-monitor the progress of therapy

Advancing our understanding of how diseases develop and helping people to stay healthy longer are among the 
greatest challenges currently facing medical scientists and healthcare providers. 
In this, both our businesses can make a difference by bringing high quality diagnostic and treatment options 
to the market. The divisions concentrate in gaining an understanding how diseases develop and play a pivotal role 
in today&#8217;s healthcare.
