RE:	Jane Thompson begins as Director of Marketing and Operations of the 
Evening and Weekend MBA Program

Effective October 1, Jane Thompson begins serving as Director of Marketing 
and Operations of the Evening and Weekend MBA Program.  She occupies Diane 
Dimeff's former office, and her e-mail address is "jane@haas".  All Evening 
MBA students will have the opportunity to meet Jane at the upcoming "Pizza 
Dinners" in October (further details forthcoming).

Prior to joining the Haas School, Jane served for 10 years at the Wharton 
School as Senior Associate Director of MBA Academic Services, where she was 
directly involved in a variety of management, curricular, and 
extra-curricular activities.  Jane holds a M.S. from the University of 
Pennsylvania in Organizational Dynamics and an M.A. from Penn State 
University in Education.

Please join me in welcoming Jane to the Haas community!
