Hey everybody! ... It's about that time again! ....

If there's anything anyone would like to see in the EMCA newsletter for
February, please e-mail it to me at BOTH:

theJulles@msn.com

and

theJulles@hotmail.com

(I have constant glitches with the computer; if you send it to BOTH, chances
are I'll get at least one.)

or drop it in my mail slot at 2117 Stanford at Drew.

We are always looking for neighborly news... births, graduations, restaurant
reviews, neighbor profiles, as well as info on new businesses, crime, new
construction, a nice paint job, etc.  Good and bad, it's all newsworthy.

Also, please let me know if you do or do not want you name printed along
with the information.  Some people prefer anonymity, some want credit for
their input.  And please note:  All articles get edited for length and other
considerations, but I try to keep the general 'gist' of the article as it
was submitted.

Also, this is the perfect time to submit an ad.  It's only $10 each month,
and reaches nearly 500 households in the direct neighborhood.  It can be
your business card, or I can write up something 'to order'.  You could even
print a (late) Valentine for your sweetie, for all the 'hood to see!

Lost pet ads run for free.
