The owner is Jack Blalock, who owned BackSttreet Café, plus some other
places, I think.  Jack died suddenly recently (heart attack, as I remember).
He wss only about 50 or so.

The scoop on Clark Gable is, ss I recall, that he was here for aprt of a
summer while taking dancing lessons at that house, where he lodged, as well.
Hr wss only here a short whiler, but locals sre so proud of that fact that
they have called the charming stucco three-story, two-rooms-on-each-floor
building the "Clark Gsable House" ever since.  The gardens surrounding the
'compound' are lovely.  You can't see much from the street, but just the
house is worth taking a walk down to see it.  And after all, iti's a bit of
local lore.
