In today's GREENWIRE:

TOP STORY: YUCCA TO GET OK FROM BUSH
President Bush's final approval to use Nevada's Yucca Mountain as the 
nation's nuclear waste repository could come as early as Monday, 
administration and congressional sources say. Energy Secretary Spencer 
Abraham approved the site last month, but Saturday is the earliest he would 
be allowed to formally recommend it to President Bush. Sources say Bush is 
expected to make a decision quickly in order to give Nevada as little time 
as possible to lobby Congress on the issue
