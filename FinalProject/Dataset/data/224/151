Facilty Planning personnel are out of office today, but will return in the morning.  I have ask for their estimate no later than Monday morning.  They may be able to give me something tommorrow.  I will complete the project model when I get a description of facilities and cost estimates.

James:
Can you roll each of the expansions that we discussed into Rod's project model? Michael Ratner will then link those into the TW financial model.

Attached is the actual contract roll off info by segment prepared by Shelley Corman for our bank due diligence.  We need to use this and assume we re-subscribe the roll off capacity at an "average rate" - Lindy, we will need your assistance in developing this avg. rate by segment.  For the expansions we discussed, Rod will circulate an expansion model that we can layer into the financial model.
Tracy: call me when you get in and we can discuss.

I have attached a template to use to summarize the capacity rolloff issue discussed today.  I just filled in a bunch of numbers as an example - if they don't make any sense, you can guess why! 
 
Lindy, if you could use this to fill in the required data, then either Michael or I will incorporate it into the TW model.
 
Thanks-
Davis
