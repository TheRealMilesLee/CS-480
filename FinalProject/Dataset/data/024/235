Per authorization fromDaren Farmer, I have changed pipe code PGEV to PGTT.  The meter no. will remain the same.  The Rate Zone is PGTT and the Trade Zone is TUFCO.

Should you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Look thru the sequence history.  The Meter # on the opposite side did not change 
even though the pipe code did.  That is all I have to suggest.

I need to get the approval from Daren Farmer ext. 3-6905.  Please feel
free to contact him to discuss this matter.
Also, I do not believe the meter no. will be the same.  I searched PI
Grid and it shows HPL with DRN 92686 interconnect with meter no.
237-07-1-004, DRN 26879 for Teco Pipeline Co.
We have discrepencies/isssues.
What verifying information do you have for this meter?
