I didn't realize that they were that creative.

I just talked to Bob H. and, as you probably already know, he said the system is fine and they will institute the complete patch over the next 7 days.  Close call there on data.

It was interesting meeting with the traders from EEL and Metals this week in London.  I'll catch up with you later next week.

I want my, I want my EOL

I want my, I want my EOL

I want my, I want my EOL

I want my, I want my EOL



Now look at them market makers's, that's the way you do it

You buy the nat gas on that EOL

That ain't tradin', that's the way you do it

Buying for nothin' and your commissions for free


Now that ain't tradin', that's the way you do it

Lemme tell ya, them guys ain't dumb

Maybe get a blister on your index finger

Maybe get carpal tunnel



We got keep the spreads real tight

Nationwide delivieries.

We got to move these molecules

We got to move these electricities



The Enron trader with the fifteen flat screens

Yeah, buying sellin', he don't care

That Enron trader got his own jet airplane

That Enron trader he's a millionaire





We got keep the spreads real tight

Nationwide delivieries.

We got to move these molecules

We got to move these electricities.



I shoulda learned to get out on the web

I shoulda learned, they have it hyped in the press

Look at that volume, they are the market share leader

I can't understand why the stock's under distress

And he's 50000 up there, what's that, no nymex noises

Every one wants one, even Dynegy.

Oh, that ain't workin' that's the way you do it

Buyin' for nothin' get your commissions forf ree



I want my, I want my EOL

I want my, I want my EOL

I want my, I want my EOL
