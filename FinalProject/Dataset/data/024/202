Info on Aruba:

Go to www.funjet.com
click on Carribean, then aruba.  It will list all of the hotels.  We are staying at the Allegro Resort Aruba - All Inclusive.  If you click on it, you  can find out about the hotel.
To price, click on reservations at the top, answer all of the questions.  Departure date is 10/17/01, flying on American,  and we are staying 4 nights.  Click 'check availability'.  Then you will have to pick your flights and hotel.  We got the insurance so we can cancel at the last minute - in the case of weather or whatever!  It will price it up for you but you can't book online.

I went through Dee (x1176) at Travel agency in the park.  They seem to get a better price than you are quoted online.

Gerald, don't be scared!  I should have eaten dinner last night!  Elizabeth had fun and that guy got her number!  Another high five to me for playing cupid!! Ha!

Let me know if you guys have any questions! 

K.
