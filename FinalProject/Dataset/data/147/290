Jim, did Ken get a chance to discuss this expense report with you?  It is mainly for late charges to an American Express bill that Andy was late paying.  He and I both felt it was the principal of the charges that neither of us really wanted to approve.

Thanks.

Rosie

p.s.  If he didn't get a chance, I will be happy to print out for you.
