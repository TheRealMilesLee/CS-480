Further to my earlier e- and voice mails, I also am trying to put together a brief business description for ENA.  I prepared the following based upon most recent 10-K and annual reports but these cover wholesale services, not just ENA.  Accordingly, ENA may also be a holding company with some of these activities legally carried out by EPMI or other entities.  If so, can you share your thoughts on revisions to below to make it accurate for ENA?  Thanks again for your help.  Regards, NJD

We need a brief description of EPMI's business as soon as possible; you were suggested.  Could you send me one by Monday morning?  Thanks, NJD
