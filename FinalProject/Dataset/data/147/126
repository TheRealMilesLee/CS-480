Rick--I have been thinking of you often during these trying times.   The range of emotions you must be experiencing must be so trying--you put your heart and soul into fighting the good fight and to see the results of your great effort slipping away must be virtually unbearable.

In any event,  it would be my great pleasure to spend some time talking over your plans.   What does Tuesday at lunch look like?  I'll be in meetings on Monday,  but please call Dorothy Barnes at 713.331.1266 and work out a time with her.   She knows I want to talk to you.  I'm looking forward to our visit.
