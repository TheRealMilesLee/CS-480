Hi csemper@ect.enron.com,

Here's your big chance to discover.

"How to Cash in On Secret Government Grant 
Money Programs They Don't Want You to Know About!"

My name is Robert Thompson and I'm the world's 
leading grant money expert. I recently decided 
to reveal all my little-known secrets anyone 
can use to collect huge sums of grant 
money from Uncle Sam. 

Many of the grant agencies involved would rather 
keep a tight lid on these programs. 

However, for a very limited time I'm spilling 
the beans so you can discover jealously-guarded 
grant money secrets such as:

* Why you are already eligible to obtain government 
   grant money... that never has to be repaid... for any 
   worthwhile purpose!

* Where to start looking for these federal funds! 
   Knowing this will shave months of frustration and 
   wasted time!

* How to find out which non-profit organizations 
   received the funding you need... and then... once 
   you know who has the money... apply directly to 
   them for assistance!

* How to tap into the world's largest source of free 
   money to start or expand an existing business!

* Why you are always just one good grant proposal 
   from getting all the money you need to start the 
   business you dreamed of!

* How to move into a nice single or multi-family home 
   and pay only 30% of the standard rent for that 
   area! Billions are spent by the federal government 
   to assist people with rent payments! Here's where
   to go and get some!

* How to collect free student financial aid! (The 
   College Board Scholarship Service reports massive 
   amounts of aid is available right now! You don't 
   even have to be poor to get it. One critical
   thing is more important to qualifying for 
   financial aid than past or present income!)

* The biggest mistake people make when writing 
   a grant proposal!

* How to qualify for down payment assistance 
   to buy a home!

* And much, much more!

To discover ALL these secrets (and more!), go below:

http://point.e-rollinginthedoughnow.info/pnt.aspx?id=390735&email=csemper@ect.enron.com

It costs you nothing to check it out. There's just 
one catch: these secrets are available for a limited 
time only... so go there now:

http://point.e-rollinginthedoughnow.info/pnt.aspx?id=390735&email=csemper@ect.enron.com

Best, Robert

P.S. Go there now, while these secrets are still 
available. If you delay, and miss out on this, you'll 
be kicking yourself hard when you see how much money 
others are collecting from Uncle Sam's grant money 
vaults with these jealously-guarded secrets. So click
