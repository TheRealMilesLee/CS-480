Any clue why sales were strong in Europe and North America? 

It might be worthwhile to talk to Allen Whitman and Michel Valois and see if they know.

Cheers,

Subject:	Norscan Statistics for October 2001

Hello,

Please the attached PRELIMINARY CHEMICAL MARKET PULP REPORT from PPPC.

Highlights:

Inventories decreased by 48,000 metric tonnes, from the 1.549 million level, to reach the 1.501 million level. This is a positive development for pulp producers especially when compared to the hitorically flat change in October.

BUT in October the the lowering of inventories did not come as a result of producer discipline. In fact Norscan producers operated at 90% in October compared to the 79% in September.

What brought the reduction in inventories is the increase in shipments this month. Shipments were 1.866 million compared to the 1.771 million level in September. Demand was at a record high for the month of October due to strong pick-up sales in North America and Western Europe. Also contributing to the high demand were the shipments to Asia/Africa.
See the table below for the summary of statistics:
