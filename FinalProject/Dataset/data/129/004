OPEC meeting was crazy.  Saudis are behaving strangely; they seem like they really don't have their act together.  It looks bearish for the time being -- WTI in the teens over the next few months unless war fears take it up.
 
I'm stopping in DC on the way home and will see you on Monday.  Hopefully we can talk shop sometime.
