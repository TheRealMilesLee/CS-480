Mike,

I have just made slight changes, however if you/patti could cite examples of non performance on certain projects/tasks that have highlighted the need for her to improve in the areas of initiative/bus skills/org skills etc.. that would be great.   Following your additions, I will send to legal (who usually will make other changes/suggestions).

Kind regards, Karen.
