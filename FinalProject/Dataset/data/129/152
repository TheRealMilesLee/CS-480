Subject:  Profile,


Hi there, I would rather introduce my self in person, but I will try as much as possible to say few things about my self. I am a very caring, loving person. I am also a collage student currently. I am not a module nor will I ever be, I went to a photographer to take some photos of my self, and he.. well helped me to put up a web site instead about my self. I have some videos and I am getting my camera setup as I am writing this. He has not asked for much. So yea, this is what I do now on my free time.
