Hey Joe, I wanted to follow up with ya...I talked with Tracy Dillee in our
HR & our trading managers.  Unforntunately, they said they didn't have a
good fit right now but definitely wanted to keep your resume on file.  They
may have other opportunities over time so I would recommend you checking
back or talking with Tracy.  She can be reached at 713-544-2400 just ask for
her name.  Good luck and stay in touch...

Tom
