The gutter and street bordering my property on Morgan between Welch and Drew
ponds water that has to evaporate away.
It is not a great deal of water and I considered it a nil prospect to get
the city to fix it.
If you all think that you might get it addressed without complicating or
jeopardizing your other concerns, I would be grateful.

Thanks

Martin
