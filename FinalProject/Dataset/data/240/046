Hello Dear,

                                CONFIDENCIAL 

I AM LUD HIANA, the director in charge of auditing and accouting section
of ZALAU BANK GHANA P. L .C, IN FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GHANA  in West Africa=

with due respect and regard .
I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very=

beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction.
During our investigation and auditing in this bank , my department came a=
cross
a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on octob=
er
31st 1999 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his accout wi=
th
this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his fa=
mily
or relation before our discovery to this development. Although personally=
,


I keep this information secret within myself to enable the whole plans an=
d
idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution .The said
amount was U.S $15.7m(fiveteen million, Seven hundred thousand United Sta=
te
dollars).As it may interest you to know , 

I got your impressive information through the chamber of commerce on fore=
ign
business relations here in GHANA REPUBLIC. Meanwhile,all the whole arrang=
ement
to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased,
get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account ha=
s
been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed t=
o
you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist me an=
d
also benefit your self to this great business opportunity. 

In fact, I could have done this deal alone but becouse of my position in
this country as a civil servant (A Banker),we are not allowed to operate
a foreign account and would eventually raise an eyebrow on my side during=

the time of transfer because I work in this bank . 

This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow wh=
o
will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to=

the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money
to be re- transferred into on his request as it may be after due verifica=
tion
and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole=

money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On
smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitle to 30% of the
total sum as gratification,while 7% will be set aside to take care of exp=
enses
that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone bills, whil=
e
65% will be for me.Please, you have been adviced to keep top secret as I
am still in service and intend to retire from service after I conclude th=
is
deal with you. 

I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you conf=
irm
the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for sub=
sequent
sharing of the fund accordind to percentages previously indicated and fur=
ther
investment,either in your country or any country you advice us to invest
in.All other necessary vital information will be sent to you when I hear
from you. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your w=
ish
in this deal. 

I look forward to your urgent reply.
Yours faithfully 
MR. LUD HIANA
