Darrell,
 
     Whats going on man?  I was talking to Rick Dietz the other day regarding an add I saw in the paper last Sunday with Burlington Resources.  They were advertising a position for a Marketing Gas Supply Representative.  I sent them a resume.  Rick mentioned to me that you knew quite a few people over there, so if you didn't mind dropping  a word for me regarding future employment, I would sure appreciate it.  I have attached my resume below if somebody wants to see it.



 
Thanks, 

Jamie
