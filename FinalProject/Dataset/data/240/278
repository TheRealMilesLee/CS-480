Would you add Steve Harris and Tracy Geaconne to your TW post- mortem (UAF meeting) notes.
Thanks,
Ellis
PS Tracy receives my weekly report and I will add Steve Harris to it as well.

Tracy Geaccone stopped me and wanted to know who was looking into TW's UAF gain for January.  Debbie Mosely informed her that there was a high gain being booked in February - I guess she does not read GMS' weekly report.  I told her I would inform the parties in the know and that someone would send an email to her and Steve Harris letting them know how the UAF gain for TW was being addressed.  Tracy and Steve were supposed to be receiving monthly UAF updates after the TW UAF meeting.  Has this practice stopped?  Please let me know who is taking the lead on this.  And we just thought we were off the hook with UAF concerns on TW!    cvb
