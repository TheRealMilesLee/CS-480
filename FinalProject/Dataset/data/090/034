          This Sunday, starting at 5:00 AM, Emergency Power Systems for the WTC Complex will shut down to test the emergency backups. 

This will not affect critical systems (computer room, phones, or the Real Time Group), as they are on both UPS and Generator. 

It will affect many of the non - critical computers and office machines on the 3rd and 4th floors of Enron. 
Please make every effort to power down all of your PC's and monitors when you leave for the day. Also, if you could help with a machine or 2 in your immediate area we would appreciate it. 

The IT group will be coming through around 4-4:30 today to power down equipment not in use and I will be in before the outage on Sunday to complete this. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the IT dept. at any time. 
Regards 
Dave Steiner
