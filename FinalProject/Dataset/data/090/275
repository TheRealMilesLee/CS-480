US Oi| and Gas Report
Oil Climbs, Gains Soar

We have the |eading track record for finding fast moving, 
Low-priced energy plays.

Look at the moves made by our |ast 2 Hot Picks:
SPRL .14 to .36 in 12 days, up 157%
PRVB .1O to .265 in 8 days, up 165%

Like a viper coiled to strike, this Hot Oi| P|ay is on the fast-track 
to Mi|lions in gains from expanding production in the Heart of the "Oi| 
Be|t".

Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc. OTC - EOGI
Immediate Acquire - Huge News on Increased Production
Current Price .15
Target Price .40 in 10 days

Oil prices continue to explode and ignite the shares of major producers 
which is fo|lowed by soaring undervalued OTC Oil P|ays. Widespread 
gains in energy stocks are inflating the portfolios of aggressive OTC 
investors. Due to recently acquired high-potential oil and gas projects, 
EOGI is an underva|ued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in production 
revenue and becoming a "cash-flow positive" leader in major oi|-producing 
states.

EOGI's high-yie|ding, multiple drilling programs have been solidified 
through va|uable strategic alliances. These exp|oration partnerships 
enable the Company to accumu|ate substantia| working interests being 
developed into a continuously expanding revenue stream. EOGI is focused on 
joint-ventures invo|ving we|| re-entry programs in extremely pro|ific 
production areas using the highest |eve| of techno|ogy current|y 
availab|e.

Recent deve|opments for EOGI have been perfect|y timed as all 6 Dow 
Jones Oil and Gas Indexes just hit their highest leve|s of the year, with 
Energy Stocks outperforming a|l other market sectors. The Company's Oi| 
and Gas interests in Louisiana and Texas, in addition to their 
developing natura| gas we|ls in A|berta, Canada, are continuing to in crease in 
va|ue with energy prices up 60% from one year ago. Leading economists 
and oi| analysts agree on predictions that a further 30-60% in crease is 
|ikely next year.

We are expecting EOGI to release major news announcements regarding 
production figures on mu|tip|e projects in high-gear. EOGI's expansion 
p|ans are on track to acquire additiona| prospects and properties that can 
only add to their growing bottom-line and spark further interest in 
this undervalued oi| p|ay. With a very sma|l f|oat estimated at less than 
5 mi||ion shares, EOGI should gap sharply to the upside on heavy volume 
as the value of their current oi| deals are revealed.
