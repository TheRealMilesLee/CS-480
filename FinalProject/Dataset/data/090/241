FAULK WON'T PLAY AGAINST JETS TOMORROW...

Posted Saturday October 20, 2001 @ 17:35 PT


In a message posted on his online forum at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch web
site, columnist Bernie Miklasz stated that Rams running back Marshall Faulk
won't play against the New York Jets tomorrow, a development head coach Mike
Martz all but announced Friday evening when told reporters he was
"pessimistic" about Faulk's chances of hitting the field this weekend.

Faulk, who refused to talk to the media Friday, was listed as questionable
on the official midweek injury report after bruising his right knee last
weekend against the Giants. He sat out of practice all week but worked out
on a treadmill. He appeared to be pain free, walking without a limp. On
Friday, the knee was not wrapped.

But Martz said at the time, "The thing with a bone bruise is (if) you play,
it sets you back. It's a temptation that's hard to fight because he wants to
play. In his mind he should play, but we're trying to do the right thing
with this and make sure that we've got him for the rest of the season."

The coach went on to say he was confident in Trung Canidate's ability to get
the job done in Faulk's absence.

Quarterback Kurt Warner, who has never played in a game for the Rams without
Faulk lined up behind him, agreed with that assessment.

"Trung has played well when he has played. He has never been in a position
where he has to carry the load. Now it is all on him. Trung is going to be
fine. He knows the system and he is a good football player. Now he's going
to get a chance to shine a little bit. We all have confidence in him that he
is going to do a great job."

Warner also pointed out that the already blazing fast St. Louis offense
becomes even faster with Canidate in the mix.

"Trung is so explosive with his speed that if you give that guy a crack he
can take it against anybody," the former Arena League star explained. "We
have seen him cut back and make some huge plays already this year. Trung has
an extra gear and he brings that speed to the equation. We are going to have
to get him up to speed with the route running part of it, and those are the
kinds of things that he will have to iron out to get to the same level so
that we can do everything that we do with Marshall with him."

While Canidate is clearly expected to handle the bulk of the workload,
Robert Holcombe is likely to get a carry or two also. ...

Other notes of interest. ...

According to SportsLine.com senior writer Pete Prisco, when you ask most NFL
players to assess their backup, you generally get a positive response --
often in the form of an eloquent or enthusiastic vote of confidence that
casts the backup in question in the best possible light.

However, that wasn't the case when Faulk was asked about Canidate last
Sunday.

Prisco wrote at the time, "Faulk clearly did not want to discuss his
replacement. In fairness, it was only an hour or so after he injured his
knee against the Giants, but even so, what would it have hurt to prop the
kid up?"

Asked what fans could expect from Canidate, the former Colts said, "I don't
know. You'll have to ask Mike Martz. He hasn't played. I don't know. I
haven't watched him play. I saw him play in the preseason.''

Asked if he'd be willing to guess what the former University of Arizona star
might be capable of, Faulk shot back with "Your guess is as good as mine.''

Faulk's behavior prompted Prisco to openly wonder whether the best running
back in the league felt threatened by Canidate's youthful speed or whether
he simply doesn't like the kid. .. Whatever his reason was, Faulk clearly
had no interest in propping up the guy in the locker next to his.

And finally. ...

Warner, who was knocked out of the game for a play by Giants defensive end
Michael Strahan, said he was fine on Thursday.

"To tell you the truth I feel great," the veteran signal caller said. "Other
than where I got hit when I got the wind knocked out of me. My back is a
little bit sore and my ribs. Other than that I feel great. I was a little
sore on Monday but I feel good today."
