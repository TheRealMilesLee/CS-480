Subject: Dear Abby.......



Dear  Abby , 
I met Laurie at a singles dance.  I knew as soon as I looked at her that she 
was too young for me. I'm 49 and she was 32 , 17 years my junior. I really 
regretted it because we got along so well that evening. She made me feel so 
comfortable in her presence.  Our age difference didn't seem to matter to 
her as much as it did to me. 
Abby, I told her I felt people were staring at us.  I said they are probably 
wondering if I am your father.  She thought I was being silly and said if I 
wanted to see her again she would be honored to go out with me. 
Laurie and I have been dating now for three months.  I really like her and I 
think she likes me.  Still, everywhere we go, I feel people watching us. 
Sometimes they just outright stare.  It is very annoying and I know it is 
because of our age difference that draws these prolonged looks from everyone 
we meet.  I just feel so uncomfortable about this whole thing and wonder if 
I should continue with the relationship. Why do people have to be so 
rude....? 
Sincerely, 
John 
PS: I have attached a picture of Laurie.
