Subject: [Footballguys] Update # 130 More Killer Target - Red Zone Data
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hi Folks,

Andy Hicks and his team have the killer Target / Red Zone data published and
are ready for you to tear into it.

Here are the Target numbers broken down by Week, Total, and Targets Per Game

For WR Targets, click here:  http://www.footballguys.com/wrtargets.htm

For RB Targets, click here:  http://www.footballguys.com/rbtargets.htm

For TE Targets, click here:   http://www.footballguys.com/tetargets.htm


It's our goal to have this all sortable here soon to make it even easier to
use.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


For those all important Red Zone touches, here are two very cool looks:


To see how teams are distributing the Red Zone touches to their different
players, click here http://www.footballguys.com/redzone1.htm

To see how many Red Zone opportunities each team is generating and how
they're mixing the run and pass there, click here
http://www.footballguys.com/redzone2.htm


We bring you this data by going through the play by play reports, looking at
every snap of every play and tabulating the data.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Always wanting to bring you more, we've partnered with our friends at
www.twominutewarning.com to give you our Exclusive "Opportunities" view with
each player's touches assigned a weighted value based upon where on the
field the touch occurred.   For instance, a rushing attempt "touch" from the
Opponent's 1 yard line has more potential value that a rushing attempt
"touch" from the RBs own 20.   It's a very cool way to measure how players
are being used.

For QB Opportunities, click here  http://footballguys.com/qbfg6.htm

For RB Opportunities, click here:   http://footballguys.com/rbfg6.htm

For WR Opportunities, click here:   http://footballguys.com/wrfg6.htm

For TE Opportunities, click here:   http://footballguys.com/tefg6.htm


We hope you'll find these innovative numbers useful.   It's just another way
we're trying to fulfill our simple Goal:  Giving You the Tools and
Information to DOMINATE Your League.

And doing it for FREE.

Best of luck this week.

Joe
