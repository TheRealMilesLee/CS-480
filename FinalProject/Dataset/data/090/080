Keith,

I noticed that a bunch of files have been placed in the folder O:_Dropbox/West New Gen.  They appear to have been created by you. This is the folder that I designated as a dropbox and the entire westpower trading organization uses that folder to look up this report.  If you would like me to move my folder, I will, but it would involve a great number of people and I hope it would be much simpler if I could move your files to a different folder.  Thanks,
