Paul,

Attached are drafts of the Tri State confirms for your review - I stuck around tonight till
Ryan amended the TAGG system so I was able to generate them...most of the way.  Review for economics:

  
(FYI, these drafts do NOT include the Annex A's, General Terms and Conditions, nor have I
signed them yet)

and then please call Bianca Ornelas (713.345.3782) and provide her with the 
counterparty contact name and fax number to add to the confirm.  She will execute for ENA
and fax out the docs to Tri-State.

(B - any questions, please call Paul at 303 575 6474.  Note: the Fixed Price on YB5833.1,.2
is the sum of the Prices of both legs...in case it looks funny to you, which is did to me.  I don't
know why they book it that way...whatever.I had Ryan put a comment in TAGG to that effect)  

Thanks everyone, and sorry I couldn't finish this up for you tonight, Paul.
-Diane
