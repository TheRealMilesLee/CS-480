--------NEWS_______________________

GILFORD, N.H., 2004 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX/ -- iStorage Networks, Inc. (Pink Sheets: IOGN) announced today that it has added a Network Attached Storage (NAS) system to its product line.

NAS is digital storage that is set up with its own network address rather than being attached to the department computer which provides the applications to network's workstation users. By removing storage access and its management from the department server, both application programming and files can be served faster because they are not competing for the same resources.

Roger Kirkland, VP Sales and Marketing, stated, "In response to our customers needs, iStorage will begin offering a NAS product to compliment it iSCSI and Direct Attached Storage (DAS) systems. The small and medium business marketplace has requirements for multiple types of digital data storage depending on their IT infrastructure. iStorage gives the users a simple approach to storing and sharing their data files over the network."

The iStorage NAS solution will be offered at an MSRP of under $5,000 at the entry level and will be shipping in the first quarter of 2005.
