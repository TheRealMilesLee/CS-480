Leslie -- The Commission was due to vote on PG&E's application for an open
season at yesterday's meeting. There were at least two PDs pending on it
(there may have been a third).  The PD by ALJ Brown denied the application.
The PD by Cmmr. Bilas allowed it to go forward, subject to conditions.  The
item ended up being held until the Commission's next regularly scheduled
meeting (August 2nd).

I was asked to find out whether the CPUC acted on protests filed to the
PG&E open season at its meeting yesterday.  Do you know anything about
this?

Thanks!
