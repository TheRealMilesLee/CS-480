    REQUEST FOR YOUR UNRESERVED ASISTANCE   

FROM:BRANCH MANAGER
(UNION BANK OF NIGERIA PLC)
MARINA LAGOS

Dear Sir,

            REQUEST FOR YOUR UNRESERVED ASISTANCE   

Firstly, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by v=
irtue
of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret. Though I know=

that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and w=
orried,
but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. We hav=
e
decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, as we have=

been reliably informed of it's
swiftness and confidentiality.

Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you. I am Yakasia Mo=
hammed
a Manager at the Union Bank Nigeria PLC, Lagos. I came to know of you in
my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very co=
nfidential
transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a fore=
ign
account requiring maximum confidence. A foreigner, an oil Merchant /contr=
actor
with the federal Government of Nigeria,until his death three years ago in=

a ghastly air crash, banked with us here at the Union Bank PLC ,Lagos, an=
d
had a closing balance of USD$7.2M (Seven Million, Two Hundred Thousand Un=
ited
States Dollars) which the bank now unquestionably expects to be claimed b=
y
any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively be donated to a=

discredited trust fund for arms and ammunition at a military war collage
here in Nigeria.

Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the Union Bank to get in touch=

with any of his  next of kin (he had no known wife and children) that the=

management under the influence of our chairman, board of directors, Retir=
ed
Major General (Egbuna O Egbu), that an arrangement for the fund to be dec=
lared
"UNCLIAMABLE " and then be subsequently donated to the trust fund for Arm=
s
and Ammunition, which will further enhance the course of misunderstanding=

among us here. 

In order to avert this negative development, myself and some of my truste=
d
colleagues in the bank now seek for your permission to have you stand as
the next of kin so that the fund, USD$7.2M, would be subsequently transfe=
rred
and paid into your bank account as the beneficiary next of kin. 

All documents and proves to enable you get this fund have been carefully
worked out and we are assuring you a 100% risk free
involvement. Your share would be 30% of the total amount, while the rest
would be for myself and my colleagues for purposes in your country. 

If this proposal is OK by you and you do not wish to take advantage of th=
e
trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly get to me im=
mediately
via my private e-mail address (yakasiahaji2@hotmail.com) furnishing me wi=
th
your most confidential telephone, fax and e-mail, so that I can forward t=
o
you the relevant details of this transaction. 

Thank you in advance for your anticipated co-operation

Regards.
yakasia mohammed
