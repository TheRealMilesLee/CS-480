Big news released: Ticker (NTMT) - NetMusic Entertainment Announces Wholesale Initiative


The NEws: 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEATTLE, Jul 8, 2005 (PRIMEZONE via COMTEX) -- NetMusic Entertainment Corporation (Pink Sheets:NTMT) announced today the company's recent alignment of focus towards the delivery of wholesale digital media and services is being well received in the marketplace. 

The company is in negotiations with several parties including certain large manufacturers of digital media devices to provide content and media delivery services for these manufacturers and their customers. The completion of these negotiations, which are in the contract stage, will provide NetMusic with positioning in a number of the nation's largest retailers.
In conjunction with these negotiations, the company has re-engineered its website and content delivery platform to better serve its wholesale clients. 

According to Chairman and CEO, Glen Starchman, "In the past weeks we took a hard look at where this industry is going, and coincidently, the answers to that question are directly in line with the vast majority opportunities that are coming to NetMusic on a daily basis.
We have focused heavily on solidifying our offerings to service these customers' requirements and closing those opportunities already on the table. Included in these efforts is a major overhaul of our technology base so that our websites and core infrastructure will better handle the unique needs of the wholesale marketplace."
