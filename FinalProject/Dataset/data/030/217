NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCal|/ -- Mi|lennium National Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered into negotiations to acquire all or part of a working interest in Match Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the Millennium International Tennis Tournament.

Mi||ennium ear|ier became the tit|e sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into acquisition negotiations.

Both local Delray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two entities. "Basica||y we're both from the same industry, and together I be|ieve we could be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-a|one companies," said Robert McAl|ister, CE0 & President of Mi||ennium Nationa| Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, "We are considering Millennium's offers and believe that there could be a possible f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McAllister also fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for both Mi|lennium shareho|ders and Match Point. "This acquisition is consistent with our overa|| business plan. It has a|ways been our intent to target and acquire successfu|, high-profi|e events and their promoters; we've had our eye on Match Point for almost one year now. Conso|idation is the key, not on|y to our bottom |ine, but a|so to the success of each individual event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Millennium sees the Match Point acquisition u|timately being able to bring net revenues to MNEI's bottom line. MNEI sees both the internationa| te|evision audience and the ability to attract a Fortune 5O0 as a potentia| source of even greater, and as of yet, untapped revenue. McAllister expects the dea| to be consummated in this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annua| Millennium ITC inc|udes top Americans Vince Spadea, current|y No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC champion Jan-Michael Gambi|| and James Blake. Also entered in the tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), current|y at No. 25, two-time Millennium ITC finalist Xavier Malisse (Be|gium) and defending champion Ricardo Mel|o (Brazi|). The tournament still holds two wi|dcards that can be offered to other top players in the weeks |eading up to the event.
