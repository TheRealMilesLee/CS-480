SRI LANKA 00700
I am MRS.KIMAEVA LIOUDMILA ,I am the wife to the late DR. ZEIGO LIOUDMILA the political adviser to President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga of SRI LANKA.
 
My husband was a victim in the recent TSUNAMI ocean earthquake disasater on the 26th December, 2004 in ASIA where over 155,000 people died.Before the disaster my husband had deposited the sum of US$21,000,000.00 (Twenty-one million United states dollars 
only), with a Finance firm in Europe. This was money meant for the purchase of ELECTORAL equipment and apparatus for the country.My husband was scheduled to travel to Europe before the disaster, but unfortunately we lost him to the earthquake disaster. Nobody is actually aware of the exact Finance firm in Europe where my husband deposited this money except me.I was able to rescue my husband's briefcase that had all the papers for the deposit with the Finance firm. Ikept this information out of the reach of anybody. You are the only one that is aware of this fact.I had to do this because my children and I needs this money at this time when we are suffering ,since our bread winner is no more. I haver to be wise. I do not want to rely on the government.
 
So therefore,I beg for CONFIDENTIALITY from your end. Now that me and my children have been rendered homeless, I need this money to get my family out of SRI LANKA and start a new life.I need you to assist me in recieving this money from the Finance firm in Europe. This will require you to travel to the office of the Finance firm in Europe to do the paper work to enable you recieve the money.
 
Get in touch with me if you will be able to do this great favor for me and my children, we beg you in the name of God. Also we beg for your 100 % honestY with us.You should send your telephone and fax numbers to me so that we can communicate properly.I will let you have more detailsabout this as soon as I hear from you.
