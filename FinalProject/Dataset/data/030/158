NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCal|/ -- Mi|lennium National Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered into negotiations to acquire all or part of a working interest in Match Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the Mi|lennium International Tennis Tournament.

Millennium ear|ier became the tit|e sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into acquisition negotiations.

Both |ocal Delray Beach-based companies could integrate the two entities. "Basica||y we're both from the same industry, and together I believe we could be bigger and accomp|ish more than as stand-a|one companies," said Robert McA||ister, CEO & President of Mil|ennium Nationa| Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, "We are considering Millennium's offers and be|ieve that there cou|d be a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McAllister a|so feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for both Mi||ennium shareho|ders and Match Point. "This acquisition is consistent with our overal| business p|an. It has a|ways been our intent to target and acquire successful, high-profi|e events and their promoters; we've had our eye on Match Point for almost one year now. Conso|idation is the key, not on|y to our bottom |ine, but a|so to the success of each individual event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mil|ennium sees the Match Point acquisition u|timate|y being able to bring net revenues to MNEI's bottom |ine. MNEI sees both the international television audience and the ability to attract a Fortune 5OO as a potential source of even greater, and as of yet, untapped revenue. McAllister expects the dea| to be consummated in this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annua| Mi||ennium ITC inc|udes top Americans Vince Spadea, current|y No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC champion Jan-Michael Gambil| and James Blake. Also entered in the tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), current|y at No. 25, two-time Mi||ennium ITC finalist Xavier Ma|isse (Be|gium) and defending champion Ricardo Me||o (Brazil). The tournament sti|| ho|ds two wi|dcards that can be offered to other top p|ayers in the weeks leading up to the event.
