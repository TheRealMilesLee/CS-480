Hello my friend!

We ask you to remember this five simple rules to treat the girlls right:

1. Remember - You are The Boss and You are The Master. All the giirls in the world are yours.
2. Forget "sweetheart", "honey", "darling" and other stupid words. You need one word - bittch.
3. Never ask bbitches if and how they like it. Just pump them the way You want.
4. Make biatches scream and suffer, they gonna love it. Then, shoot your load right into their faces.
5. Get to this site to see cruel reip action and dirty f0rced sseexx. We do not promise, we simply deliver.
