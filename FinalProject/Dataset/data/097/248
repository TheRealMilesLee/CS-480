It's just 3 of us right now.  Me, Natalie, and Lorena.  I think Natalie's friend, Jeff, might be joining us as well.  I know we all talked about not drinking and driving so the limo is a great idea.  I'll mention it to them.  We all have costumes.  Are you still planning to dress up as me??

I was thinking of renting a Limo ($70.00/hr), so we don't have to drive.  But, everybody that was thinking of going with me is backing out.  What do you think?  I want to drink but I don't want to drive.  How many girlfriends do you have going.  Oh by the way my costume is very weak.
