Dear
  I am Barrister James Ore, a solicitor at law. I am the personal attorney to Mr. Mark Miner a national of your country, who used to work with Shell-development Company in Nigeria. Here in after shall be referred to as my client.
 
  On the 21st of April 2000, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along sagamu express road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. 
 
 Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locateany of my clients extended relatives this has also proved unsuccessful. 

After these several unsuccessful attempts, to locate any member of his family hence I contacted you.
 
 I am contacting you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposit were lodged.

 Particularly, the finance company where the deceased had an account valued at about $18.5 million (EIGHTEEN MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS).

They issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next ten official working days.

 Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you have the same last name, so that the proceeds of this account valued at $18.5 million dollars can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money. 60% to me and 40% to you. I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. 

All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through.

I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me by my email and send to me your telephone and fax numbers to enable us discuss further about this transaction.

Best regards,

Barrister James Ore
