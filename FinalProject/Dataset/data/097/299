To Our Readers:

Here's what's happening today in the war on terrorism and the anthrax
warnings:

Saying the airstrikes have already claimed too many innocent lives, a
group of Afghan exiles hoping to put together a coalition government to
replace the Taliban has appealed to the U.S. to halt its bombing campaign.
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/STRIKE_MAIN.html

The head of the Postal Service is asking Americans to be careful opening
their mail, while cautioning that the odds of anthrax contamination are
"very, very slim."

Plus,

The British and Soviet empires came to an end shortly after fighting in
Afghanistan. Could it be the same for America?

The U.S. is under pressure to wrap up attacks before the start of the
Islamic holy month.
