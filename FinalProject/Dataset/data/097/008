I believe that Scott Josey is the commercial guy responsible for Crescendo.  I have left him a voice mail about this and will let everyone know his response.

Janet just left me a voice mail and believes this is an ENA deal after all.  Barbara--you may want to get ahold of Janet to verify ownership on this one.  Please let this group know what the final answer is.  DF

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.  In case you access email ahead of voice mail Janet, the guy is Chistopher Sullivan, Rocky Mountain Helium, 1-800-945-1547.  Thanks all.  DF
