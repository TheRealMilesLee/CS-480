Conference Call scheduled for Thursday, October 25, 3:00 PM Central Time:

Dial-in Number:	1-888-832-0082
Passcode:	5323#

We have four ports reserved.  The Omaha participants will meet in Conference Room 456.  I'm assuming the Houston attendees will gather in one location.  If this is not correct, please let me know so we can add additional ports.

NOTE TO GREEK:  Do you plan to dial in from a remote location?  

It is very important that we have enough ports reserved.  I would appreciate everyone's efforts in providing me with the information I need to insure that we have sufficient capability to conduct this teleconference.

Thanks, everyone!

Dee
