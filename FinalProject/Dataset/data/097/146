Please respond to this email with the type of monitor you would like to purchase.  Will have a lottery type drawing on Friday Morning. By Friday afternoon, you will be notified that you can come by and pick out your monitor. We need to have all monitors picked up and removed my Friday the 2nd. After that, all remaining monitors will be donated to charity.
