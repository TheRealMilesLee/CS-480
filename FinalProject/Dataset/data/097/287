My, my, aren't you bold!  I think we should all go together, but not sure if Nat and Lorena will go for the limo.  Nat's ALWAYS broke and Lorena is not working.  Nat said Jeff might drive.  Apparently, he has a DUI and will not drink.  That could be a possibility.  I'll find out.

It's just 3 of us right now.  Me, Natalie, and Lorena.  I think Natalie's friend, Jeff, might be joining us as well.  I know we all talked about not drinking and driving so the limo is a great idea.  I'll mention it to them.  We all have costumes.  Are you still planning to dress up as me??

I was thinking of renting a Limo ($70.00/hr), so we don't have to drive.  But, everybody that was thinking of going with me is backing out.  What do you think?  I want to drink but I don't want to drive.  How many girlfriends do you have going.  Oh by the way my costume is very weak.
