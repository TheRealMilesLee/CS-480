Hey Tracy,
 
How are you?  It seems like ages since we've seen each other. 
 
Bunco...well, I know Pam Guidry was the October person, but we figured it
wouldn't happen because she hasn't been to the last couple of Buncos.  Then
the list ended and I haven't heard from anyone complaining.  I'm not sure if
Christi Chickering is still having a Holiday Bunco or not. I'm surprised we
haven't heard from Sandra or Debbie via e-mail. Mary Lynn probably won't
join again, she wants to do a small dinner group with just you, me, Lisa,
Stephanie...the five of us...unless I'm missing someone.
 
Let me know when you're free for lunch, I'm pretty flexible these days.
