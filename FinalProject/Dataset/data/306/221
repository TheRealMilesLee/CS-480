Greetings,

I understand from a conversation with John Allocca of KeySpan that Enron
intends to release back to Boston Gas the 35,679 Dth/d beginning July 1,
non-recallable, through 4/1/07 (the end date of the original release to
Enron).

The capacity can be posted, confirmed and awarded via our bulletin
board.  Ivy can walk you through the release and it can be done in about
5 minutes.  The capacity will revert back to its original contract,
Boston Gas R-420-01.

Please call me if you have any questions, or if we are in error
regarding this matter.

Regards,

Robin
