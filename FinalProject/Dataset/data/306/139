  <http://www.pmaconference.com/imagesemail/id000070/id00005.gif>	
Using a mix of lecture and unique "hands-on" exercises, attendees will learn the latest trends in structured financing, the criteria financial institutions and credit rating agencies use to analyze and evaluate projects for funding, and today's latest concepts in risk mitigation (including techniques for estimating and mitigating market risk). 	
  <http://www.pmaconference.com/imagesemail/id000070/id00006.gif>	
Valuation Modeling for Project Finance will not only teach you how to develop models using alternative software, but it will provide participants with an understanding of the underlying financial and economic concepts--debt capacity, cost of capital, contract vs. merchant pricing structure and Monte Carlo simulation. Those who complete this course will have the ability to develop financial models from scratch and use these models to perform complex financial engineering tasks.
