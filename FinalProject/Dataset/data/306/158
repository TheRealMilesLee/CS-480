The past six months certainly have been challenging for all of us at Enron.  With so much change and uncertainty, stress is inevitable.  To help employees better manage stress, Enron's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) will sponsor Brown Bag sessions on Tuesday, July 9 and Thursday, July 18 from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. in the Enron Building, EB5C2.  The group's size for each session will be limited to maximize dialogue, so register early to guarantee a seat.  If necessary, additional Brown Bag sessions will be scheduled to accommodate demand.

To register for one of the scheduled sessions, please click on the appropriate date button above.  If you have questions about the sessions, please contact Linda Hallmark at 713-345-3592.
