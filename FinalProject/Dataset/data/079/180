Louise and I are working on our list - we're close.
 
One thing that came up at a PRC meeting on Friday was the payment date for bonuses.  I think we lose 1/2 of the first quarter every year while everyone waits and worries about bonuses.  I suggested that we tell employees on Jan 10th and pay on Jan 15th.  The only reason that was given that could prevent this was the date of the board meeting.  If that could be changed we could easily be ready by the 5th to7th of Jan.  Now that the company is not going to have seventy prc meetings we should be able to do this.  Do you know any other obstacles?  
 
John
