A surprisingly
funny "hi!"
	 <http://cme1.americangreetings.com/Key=2191.CiIB.E.CsekUU>

BAD hair day?

        It's been said that laughter is the shortest distance between two
        people. Span the miles with a funny Just Because <http://cme1.americangreetings.com/Key=2191.CiIB.C.CHxqCN> greeting.
