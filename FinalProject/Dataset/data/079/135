ATTN: MD/CEO

Kindly accept my apology for sending my mail to you.I Am a
true God fearing person, and I want you to trust me and
help me out in this my condition. I believe you are a
highly respected personality, considering the fact that I
sourced your profile from a human resource profile database
on your country in the Internet.

Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with
events and fragile political situation in Liberia but it
has formed consistent headlines in the CNN, BBC news
bulletins.

My Name is MRS.SUZANA NUHAN VAYE from Liberia, a Country in
West Africa. My late Husband is Issac Nuhan Vaye, Deputy
Minister of Public Works in Liberia. My Husband was falsely
accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA
CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor
killed him. You can verify this from some of the
international newspapers posted in the web sites below:

(I)http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-07-15-liberia_x.htm
(ii) http://www.unwire.org/UNWire/20030716/449_66 21.asp

Before my husband was killed, he moved out the sum of $21.5
million and large quantities of Diamonds through a
diplomatic means, and deposited it with a Security Company
Abroad.

All that is needed is for my lawyer to instruct the company
to transfer the funds/diamonds to your account, I will
remunerate you with 20% at the end, but most of all is that
I solicit your trust in this transaction.I have been
confined only to our country home and all my calls are
monitored, So I will advise you contact my private Attorney
on his contact stated below for onward proceedings: -

        NAME:BARR.PATRICK.O. WILLIAMS (ATTORNEY)
        TEL/FAX:27-11-507-6559
        EMAIL:powilliams600@web-mail.com.ar
        

Kindly include your Full Name, Private Telephone and Fax
Numbers where you can always be reached, your Residential
or Company Address to enable him send detail
information/documents that will enable you receive the fund
without any problem either now or in future as all
modalities as been perfected.

Please your urgent response is needed.

Best Regards.
