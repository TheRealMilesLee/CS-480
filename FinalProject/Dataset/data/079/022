Paul,

Once the expansion is completed (in the next couple of months), Petrogulf
will have access to all delivery points off Jonah.  They currently don't
have access to Opal.  I think that's all the super secret information I can
divulge.

Hope you have a great weekend.  I have a small wager with Shari Wojta that
the Fightin' Texas Aggies will Beat the Hell Outta CU tomorrow.  Hope I
don't have to eat crow.

See you next week.
