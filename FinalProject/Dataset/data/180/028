 <http://mailer.irewards.com/?sku=608207&store=quickflicks&campaign=2001-12-26_quickflicks>Norton Internet Security™ 2001 protects your computer from viruses, hackers, and other Internet threats. This powerful suite now includes Intrusion Protection to maximize your defense against hackers. Versatile privacy control features keep Web sites from harvesting personal information. Its anti-virus software, will protect your system from harmful viruses 24 hours a day. And it's easier than ever to use, with a new Security Assistant that gets you up and running right away. Norton Internet Security 2001 is a must-have for anyone who uses the Internet to shop, bank, surf, or communicate.

Stop viruses and other malicious code--automatically. Norton AntiVirus™ provides maximum protection against Internet and email viruses, working in the background to defend your computer 24 hours a day. And, with Symantec's exclusive LiveUpdate, it will automatically check for and download new virus definitions whenever you're online.

Defend your PC against hackers. Any computer that accesses the Internet is a potential target for people to steal or even delete your personal files. Norton Personal Firewall safeguards your PC and your personal information from intrusions and prevents the applications on your PC from secretly making connections to Internet sites and sending information to them. Intrusion Protection with AutoBlock automatically stops systems from trying to probe your PC.

Keep your personal information private. Do you ever provide bank account information, credit card numbers, or other confidential data to Web sites? Now, you can indicate which information you want to protect, and Norton Privacy Control will ensure that you don't accidentally send it to an unsecured Web site. You can also stop Web servers from retrieving your email address and other personal information without your knowledge.

Block unwanted ads: Banner ads and pop-up windows can clutter your screen and lengthen Web page download times. Norton Internet Security 2001 lets you filter them out for faster, more-enjoyable Web experiences.

Get regular protection updates--free for one year! Symantec's Internet Security experts update Norton Internet Security 2001 continuously to deal with new viruses and other Internet threats. As a registered user, you'll get free anti-virus and firewall updates for one year. After that, you can subscribe to future updates for a low annual fee.
