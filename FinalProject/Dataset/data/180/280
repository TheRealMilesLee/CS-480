Alternative Fueling Stations
Obtain State Grants


Sacramento - Ten projects have been awarded grants totaling $2.3 million in the State's continuing effort to displace petroleum-based motor fuels in the transportation sector.

The California Energy Commission grants will help shoulder the cost of fueling stations for natural gas and propane-powered public fleets - including transit buses, trash haulers and medium-duty trucks. The total costs for all the projects amount to over $13 million. For every dollar of State funding, the participating agencies have earmarked an average of $5 each to achieve long term success in promoting alternatives to petroleum fuels. The Energy Commission's grant funding will also reduce the public agencies' alternative fuel cost by about $1.3 million over three years.

Grant winners under the Commission's Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Program were: the City of Los Angeles, $250,000; City of Fresno, $250,000; City of Industry, through City of Industry Disposal Company, $196,427; City of Placentia, $225,000; City of Commerce, $250,000; County Sanitation District of Los Angeles, $250,000; the City of Temecula Rapid Transit Agency, County of Riverside, Rancho California Water District and CR&R Solid Waste Management through Downs Commercial Fueling, $250,000; The California Department of Transportation, San Luis Obispo County, California State University Channel Islands, California Polytechnic San Luis Obispo, Lucia Mar School District, City of Solvang and Santa Inez Transportation Company, through Delta Liquid Energy, $250,000; City of Colton, $250,000; and Southwest Transportation Agency in Riverdale, $150,000. 

The Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Program seeks to displace petroleum-based motor fuels and assist California in attaining health-based air quality standards. Top priority for the program is to deploy low-emission alternative fuel vehicles, especially for cities, counties, local educational agencies, State fleets and project participants of the Interstate Clean Transportation Corridor (ICTC).
