The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time.
I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading
house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in
prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching,
but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or
college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and
doesn't take themselves too seriously.
