Hey Moma Bunny,
 
You know that you don't have to thank me for talking to my Lil Brother.  That's something thats going to come automatically, not just TO SHOW other people that I care, but it helps me stay in a relationship with him and God.  Even though they make me want to...sometimes, I still have much luv for them and I can't give up on them.  If they see me give up on them, they can give up on themselves and I am not having that.  Matt and the rest of them are a hand full and they don't always do everything they are suppose to. So they are not perfect and I like that because no-BODY'S, (body's of people, pastors, choirs, leaders, ministries, CHURCHES) are perfect, and if we were perfect we wouldn't have any problems and if we didn't have any problems, we would not have nothing to pray about, and if we didn't have nothing to pray about, we probably would not talk to God, and if we didn't talk to God we could not give him the Praise.  Well enough of me trying to get you to come back from your vacation from OUR church.  But know that Matt is always going to be my boy, and me not seeing him as often he going to make me call him even more. 
 
So...C-Ya Sunday, I don't think yall have choir rehearsal this week because this is going to be Young-Ault and Youth Sunday.
 
Luv ya lots and miss ya (already),
 
Monte (Jaye)

I wanted to thank you, J'Woyne and Quentin for checking on Matthew on yesterday.  It really blessed him (me, too!).  Tell J'Woyne and Quentin, thanks for me.
