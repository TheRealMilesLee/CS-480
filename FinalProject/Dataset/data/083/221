Greg - It is my understanding that you have declined approving invoices for several bond premiums that are listed below.  All of these bonds are related to the PG&E acquisition and are all issued under the name Enron Energy Marketing Corp. and they have come up for renewal in the last couple of months.  We verified with the gas desk, power desk and Karen Cordova in EES Legal, that these bonds were still required. 

All of these bonds have been renewed and issued, however the bond premium still needs to be paid.  If you are not the right person to approve these, please let me know who is.  I was directed to you.  Thank you for your assistance, Teresa
