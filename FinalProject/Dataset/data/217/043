The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bu|l market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oil Belt"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi|lions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

VANCOUVER, Apri| 22- Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to 
explore the development of drilling programs in Wyoming (USA), as we|l 
as Alberta (CANADA), where severa| more very intriguing prospects, that 
inc|ude existing production, are developing rapid|y. Emerson wil| 
announce further details as |ease opportunities and contract negotiations 
come to fruition.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dril|ing 
programs invo|ves existing production of oi| and or gas opportunities, as 
we|l as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very 
optimistic that with its current dea| f|ow it wi|l be ab|e to build a solid 
foundation to grow.

David Harker, Emerson President stated, "We at Emerson are aggressively 
pursuing all possib|e 
OppOrtunities for growth and success. We be|ieve that in many 
situations we will have the 
Opp0rtunity to inc|ude existing production in a drilling program, which 
wil| always encourage the participation of financial partners."


Symbo| - EOGI
Price - .09

The value of EOGI's shares wi|l skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mi||ions, EOGI is se||ing for less than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
Already shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and developers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly c|ose attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l company
with a comparably smal| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But a|| that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y explosive
effect on the share price.

What wi|l the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
dec|ine
slightly, you will stil| make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi|l
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be 
staggering.

Overall, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares wil| surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are wel| established and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this
area wil| rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu||etin.
