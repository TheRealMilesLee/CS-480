Look forward to seeing you then.

Hi Bertmeister!
Good to have you back in the UBS fold. It is also good to hear all is going
well for you and Molly. I would look forward to getting together sometime,
perhaps for breakfast next Tuesday or Wednesday (2/5 or 2/6). Let me know
which works for you.

Tom

Tom:

Just wanted to drop you a line to let you know that I am again an employee
of UBS.  As I am sure you are aware, we are in process of transition from
Enron to UBS.  I recently filled out all the appropriate paperwork to
complete the transition.  From what I understand we are going to be a part
of the trading arm of UBS Warbug.  This should be very exciting.  Maybe one
day I will have the opportunity to trade stocks, bonds, or some other
financial product if power ever becomes old hat.  

Furthermore, I have will soon receive a signing bonus and a raise, so I
intend on funding my IRA and my wife's IRA for 2001 and maybe even 2002.  If
it wouldn't be too much trouble, I would like to know what the contribution
levels are for 2002.  I think I saw something that changed them and the
income levels one can have for a Roth.

As for Molly, the advertising business seems to be picking up for 2002.  She
opened enough new business in the fourth quarter of 2001 to meet her goals
and is on her way to making it the first quarter as well.  I think she is
really beginning to understand her business.

Anyway, I currently have lots of time to myself since we are not trading, so
maybe we can have lunch sometime.  If that is not possible, no big deal, I
know that you are extremely busy.

I hope all is well with you and your family.

Sincerely,

Bert
