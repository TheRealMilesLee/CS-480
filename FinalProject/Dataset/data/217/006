I have a family friend who is trying to fill an accounting/office
administration position.  It is a family who has oil and gas interests,
partnership interests and other family investments.  They use KPMG as their
accountants but they need someone in house to input data and prepare monthly
reports for them and to give to the accounting firm.  Salary range is around
$40,000 and includes health insurance and parking.  They are located
downtown.

If you know anyone interested and qualified, have them email me.
