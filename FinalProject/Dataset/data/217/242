ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

PREVIEW for February 3, 2002

======================================

Dear Folks -

   Wow! What a ton of feedback I've gotten from the past two Sundays.
I'll share that with you this week. Most of it is about the
presentation on our work in Bolivia. Some of it about community-
building.

   Some of the more "theological/theoretical" questions I've gotten
have to do with the general area of "how do we know what we know and
how do we know if it is true?"

   If our goal is to take the journey of life in such a way that we do
not die an unlived life, how do we know that the choices we make about
being and doing are correct and true?

   A couple of years ago there was a movement that attempted to answer
this question by the phrase WWJD - What Would Jesus Do? What, for
example, would Jesus do about the terrorist attacks on 9/11?   Then
there were the copycats of that position - What Would Buddha Do? etc.
My beautiful bride suggested WWGUD - What Would A Grown-Up Do?

   This week when we gather I want to talk with you about these
terribly important matters –

     How Do We Know - For Sure

                And

          How Do We Decide?

   I hope you choose to be present.

Much love,


Bill Kerley
