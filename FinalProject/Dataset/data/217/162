Erik, Dean, & Mike,
 
Do you folks feel you will be able to schedule the east power contracts with some assistance from Jason and Lisa on Monday and do you have the logins that you will require?  If not, what do we need to get?
 
Tom.

I'm not sure. Corry came over and told me this was happening on Monday.  It shouldn't be a problem for me and Lisa to come down and help whoever is going to be scheduling.

Jason,
 
Why has this now changed to Monday from Thursday morning and who made this decision?
 
Will we be able to schedule Monday without the UBS folks?
 
Tom
