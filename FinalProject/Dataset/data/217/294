Mark, 

Has UBS decided to allow for true netting of cross-commodity exposure with counterparties under the master ISDA?  I'd like to know as this is an important pitch to our customers to trade financial products with us in power initially until we receive our physical license.  Could you get back to me before 2:30pm today?  Thanks,

Fletch Sturm
