Hi Baby. :) 
I just wanted to drop you a quick one to let you know that I'm thinking about you. I love you and I'm looking forward to a little Yoko action tonight. I'm also looking forward to a little C squared action as well. ;-)

I love you baby. I hope you are having a good day. 

See you tonight.
