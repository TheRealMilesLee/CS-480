Dear Sir/Madam


INVESTMENT INQUIRY.

I am Mr. Williams Kadiata, a Zimbabwean and the son of Chief Edward Kadiata, 
a known farmer and the High Chief of Bulawayo Town in Zimbabwe. I write on 
behalf of my family, to inquire you are available and have the facility to 
assist my family undertake some capital investment in your country. It will 
be necessary to inform you that the funds (US$18.5M) EIGHTEEN MILLION, FIVE 
HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS: intended for capitalization of the 
investments are presently in the custody of a private Security Company here 
in Johannesburg South Africa, which will require to
transfer out of South Africa for the said investment purposes.

You may have heard of the present crisis in Zimbabwe orchestrated by the 
unprecedented “LAND USE ACT” of the government of Robert Mugabe in which his 
government has arbitrarily reclaimed and acquired all farm lands owned by 
white farmers in the counrty. This has caused a historical dispacement of 
the white folks who are known to be the country’s main farmers. The ensuing 
struggles and strife have brought about the killing and imprisonment of 
thousands of these white
farm owners by the ruthless government force designated to enforce this new 
order.

My father, in his good will and capacity as the High Chief of Bulawayo Town, 
joined the international
community in condemning and speaking out against this uncivilized and 
bizarre policy of Robert Mugabe’s government. As a result of my father’s 
firm and upright position on this matter, a group of assailants suspected to 
be government sympathizers attacked and killed my father in cold blood in 
march last year. Seeing that the entire Lumka family was in serious threat 
of extinction, we immediately fled Zimbabwe to South Africa, where we have 
sojourned ever since.

Prior however, to my father’s untimely death, he had, sensing the rising 
hostilities of the government of Robert Mugabe, sold all his farm lands 
including those of five of his white farmer associates who had transferred 
ownership of their farm lands to my father to forestall the government 
acquiring them. Unfortnately, these white farmers associates of my father 
have also been assassinated in the crisis. My father secretly send the 
proceeds (US$18.5M), from sales of the farm lands to South Africa, a 
neighbouring sister country and had deposited the same in a metal box with a 
private Security Company here in Johannesburg. For obvious security reasons, 
contents
of this metal box were decleared as “family valuables” to the Security 
Company. The ownership of this “depository” is now transferred to me by 
title, following my father’s death.

Having seen your contact information in my father’s private study, we now 
contact you for immediate assistance in lifting the fund out of South Africa 
for the said investments. It will intrest you to note that we have all this 
while articulated the needful arrangements through which the transfer will 
be effected. We will be willing to come to terms with you regarding your 
rewards for helping us actualize this matter which we have agreed to offer 
you 20% of the total money, 5% will be mapped out for the expenses we may 
incure during this transaction then 75% will be for me and my family. It is 
equally important to state here that considering the nature of this matter, 
we
will require that it is handled most discrectly. Kindly contact me using the 
above particulars upon
receipt of this message for execution details and other necessary 
discussion. In anticipation of your
trusted and genuine assistance I remain.

Yours sincerely,

Mr.Willams  Kadiata
