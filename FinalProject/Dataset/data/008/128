Regardless of your "misc mind altering" habits, I think Will did say that they would only be able to have path modifications/cuts modified in the notes part initially.  Then (whenever the "next" modification was implemented), they would add the capability to interact with Enpower deals (ie write notes to the deal record and then, provide an entry point for deal entry for new deals done).

The East Group does not need to see POR/POD in the path for "transmission."  My intent was to put a counterparty name in the TRAN1 NAME column (example: TVA), and Enpower deal number in TRAN1 DEAL#	(example: 236891.1) if available, and Oasis number + level of reliability in TRAN1 OASIS	 
(example:  30912345 F-7).  I thought the logic for "Tag" and "Oasis" should be a combination of text and numbers. The reasoning for Border 2 was to have an additional border point to query for (in confirmation) when we move from one place to another. What if you put the borders in the Oasis column (ie: WW/MEAD 123456 F-7)? The path would be: Generation-marketer-E-TRANS(T) WW/MEAD 123456 F-7-E-marketer-Sink.

Gotta run,

Good Morning,

Did you read Will's last note?  Anyway, I am wanting to do one of two things and need to know which you like better.

The name and oasis number representation for tranny is not enough info for us.  We need POR and POD information as well. So,  I need the following capability

Either  

Put the transmission path in the E cell like we do now,

or

Put more information in the Trans name  ( ie:  APS-(T)PV/WW)  and in the OASIS cell  (ie:  23055 HNF)


Do you have a preference?  

We also need to be a united front about the design and intent of the Path Cut. They are not wanting to make it work all the way. I sure don't remember the conversations being that it should be just a replacement for the notes part, but because it's enpower everything should work together.  Am I on crack?


Thanks,

Cara
