Clothes make the man. . All the day you'll have good luck.. Laugh and the world laughs with you. Cry and you cry alone. .
Ask no questions and hear no lies. . Persuasion is better than force. . The second mouse gets the cheese. .

Actions speak louder than words. . Good company on the road is the shortest cut. . Listen to the pot calling the kettle black. .
