Good morning,
Below is the preliminary information for the August meeting that I sent to John last week.  There are some time sensitive issues with deposits for some of the venues.  Would you please review the information and if I could have a few minutes of your time, I would really appreciate it.
Thanks.
Dorie

Attached is a file containing the following information for your management meeting in Beaver Creek (August 16-19, 2001):
	Preliminary Agenda
	Cost Estimate
	Outside Speaker Options
I am holding 3 Enron aircraft for this event and have included that price in the cost estimate.
I have reviewed all the video tapes for the outside speakers with the exception of the political humorists.  The only one that I would not recommend is Joe Malarkey.  I thought his material was 'pure malarkey' - but that is just my opinion.  I have bios if you would like to see them.  We are not limited to this list - I can check pricing and availability for anyone that you would like to suggest.
Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
Thanks.
