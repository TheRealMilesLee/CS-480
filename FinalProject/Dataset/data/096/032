As of now I will also be working on the general A&A pool for ENA as well as working with you on the Trading and Orig. Tracks.    I just got the numbers from the A&A program on the ENA Participation on the forthcoming A&A Fantastic Friday/Super Saturday Interview dates.   As you can see ENA's participation is very low (pretty dismal).      The de-brief sessions basically allows interviewers to select the candidates to their groups there and then... so ENA has to be there.    

Oct 26 has only 5 ENA interviewers all the remaining interviewers are EES and EIM.    I know EES are stacking quite heavy on the A&A side.    Therefore, I will shortly be e:mailing your direct reports to solicit their and their direct report's participation in these interviews. It would be helpful if this could be re-inforced by you.

Many thanks!.

Karen.
