Galen, I think you can get the break out of receipt (supply area) imbalances vs market area imbalance from the monthly excel spreadsheets in the common directory (p:)FGTUSERS/FGTMktg/... under Lindley (the place you directed me to earlier today).  I took the spreadsheet for July 01 and sorted it by imbalance type (i.e. Market Area, No Notice, Receipt Point, etc) for my reconciliation.  I think this will get you the numbers Shelley is looking for (the market area imbalances - positive and negative).  Jim

Galen/Jim,

Thanks for the info.  I have been building spreadsheet cases all day.   FYI - majority/minority isn't driven by the number of shippers, its driven by the volume.  I made the appropriate changes on Galen's spreadsheet.


A couple of further things that I need:
- I need to reconcile the net volume on Galen's sheet by month with the net cash out volumes on Jim's sheet.  There are huge differences.  Can these really all be receipt imbalances?

Galen for the months Aug 00-Jul 01 can you break out receipt imbalances from market imbalances.   We are only planning to put the majority/minority pricing on the market area imbalances.


Let me know if you guys want to sit down and talk through this.  I need to get Teb my final analysis by the end of the week.
