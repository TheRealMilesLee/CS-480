Saturday doesn't work for me.  Email Tim at www.discovery@cmconline.com <http://www.discovery@cmconline.com/>.  I think I'm free Thursday night but I may be taking a customer to dinner.  What does Friday night look like?

I have been in a new position (orientation) for the past 4 weeks, and been VERY busy myself.  How about Thursday or Saturday. The only days Carolyn can't would be Wed.'s  
 I think we should all meet somewhere for drinks and go from there. Please e-mail Tim, and also give me his address for Carolyn.
Let me know what you think so I can at least alert Carolyn as well.
Debbe.

Hey what are you guys doing partying without me.  Yes I have been traveling, in fact I have been gone almost all October, up through the 15th.  But I'm finished.   When are you thinking of getting together?

Hi Paul,
 
Ran into "Tim" at Sambuca's Friday night, and he was wondering what happened to our "get together" we were supposed to have several weeks ago????
I told him I hadn't heard back from you, therefore assumed you were not interested. He said he thought you were out of town a great deal, but was going to e-mail you because he wants possibly to set something up with us four. (Myself, Carolyn and you two)
No problem if you are too busy, believe me I understand.........or whatever the reason might be. 
 
Take care,
Debbe.
