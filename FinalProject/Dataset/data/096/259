BRET SCHUNDLER'S TELEMARKETING SCAM:
REAL SHAME LIES IN HIS EFFORT TO MISLEAD SENIORS

McGreevey for Governor campaign director Steve DeMicco today stood by the 
campaign's radio ad exposing Republican Bret Schundler's attempt to mislead 
seniors on his property tax relief plan, and fired back at the Schundler 
campaign for its disingenuous plan to reduce their property taxes.

"Bret Schundler is doing a disservice to seniors in New Jersey with his 
statewide telemarketing campaign that is misleading voters," said DeMicco. 
"Within 72 hours of the calls promising a tax cut, he backed off the plan, 
saying there would not be any tax cuts next year. (Source:  Associated 
Press, 9/27/01)  To date, Mr. Schundler has yet to say just when his plan 
would be implemented.  Our seniors deserve better, and he ought to apologize 
to them for misrepresenting his plan for political gain."

Last week, the McGreevey campaign began airing a radio ad exposing 
Schundler's scheme to mislead seniors. In recent weeks, Schundler launched a 
statewide phone-banking effort, calling seniors throughout the state 
promising a new property tax cut.  But, when questioned about the plan, 
Schundler backed off his proposals and admitted that there will be no tax 
cut next year.

DeMicco also lambasted the Schundler campaign for its TV and radio ads that 
have been criticized by the media.  The New York Times called his ads 
"misleading" (10/20/01) and The Bergen Record called them a "stretch" 
(10/16/01), and charged that Schundler "exaggerates" his record  (9/26/01).

"Mr. Schundler has consistently distorted Mayor McGreevey's record and have 
at best misrepresented his own record - on taxes, on crime and on parkway 
tolls," DeMicco said.  "The voters deserve straight talk, and it's clear 
that Jim McGreevey is the only candidate for governor who is putting forth a 
responsible plan to improve public schools, put drivers before auto 
insurance companies, provide real property tax relief, protect a woman's 
right to choose and to fight any effort to weaken New Jersey's tough gun 
laws. That's the kind of governor New Jersey deserves - not one who is going 
to make reckless promises just to get elected."
