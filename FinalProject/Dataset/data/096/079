	Dear Mr. Netland:

	I am an assistant general counsel with the Enron Litigation Unit, and have been retained in this matter by Enron Petrochemicals, Inc.  The matter arises out of the contamination of approximately 6,000,000 pounds of styrene monomer while in a tank located in a Odfjell Terminals (Baytank) Inc. facility on or about November 4, 1999.  Enron believes that the contamination was the result of the negligence of Baytank.  The two-year Texas tort statute of limitations is approaching and we would request an extension of the suit filing time for a period of sixty (60) days.  As we may otherwise have to file suit this week, we would appreciate your immediate response.  If you are not the person authorized to agree to such an extension, please let me know as soon as possible who is.

	My direct telephone line is (713)-853-6307, my telefax number is (713)-853-6576, and my e-mail is "britt.davis@enron.com."

	I appreciate your courtesy.

	Respectfully,

	Britt Davis
