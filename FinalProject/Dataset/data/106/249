They best way to manage your day gas problem would be to find counterparties that you are long last day prompt swaps (that are expiring now), and take them off throughout the day.  For example, if a counterparty wants to reduce settlement risk, you can have a futures broker help manage match swaps counterparties and do an offsetting futures position, from which you can get long futures.
