Title: Viewing Environmental Strategy Issues in a New Light

STRATEGIC CHALLENGES GROW IN ENVIRONMENTAL ARENA

The issues that are most prominent in the environmental arena are notable for 
their relatively long time horizons. Thus, although the uncertainty created by 
recent events might cause adjustments in environmental strategies it is less 
likely to result in fundamental shifts in direction. In the immediate future, 
however, the challenge will be in responding to a shifting landscape while 
maintaining long-term objectives.

* Parties to the Kyoto Protocol are forging ahead with final negotiations, 
while the US focus is on when a domestic climate change policy might appear.

* The European Union is moving toward development of a unified greenhouse gas 
emissions trading scheme, while individual European nations are developing or 
implementing their own (potentially incompatible) systems.

* Continued technology maturation combined with heightened energy security 
concerns is solidifying the foundation of the renewable energy niche, bringing 
increased focus on remaining technical and political hurdles.
