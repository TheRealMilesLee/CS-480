Subject: Republican Telemarketing Fraud

Continuing the track record of Republican telemarketing fraud during this 
campaign, it appears they have another one up their collective sleeves: a 
sleazy telemarketing call, usually from anonymous sources, falsely claiming 
to be calling on behalf of Democratic Headquarters and variously requesting 
contributions or Election Day volunteers.  The callers are often rude or 
abruptly hang up once challenged.

Please be aware these are not authorized calls.

While Jim wants to help voters, his adversaries appear bent on annoying and 
harassing them.

Help us bring this shameless and illegal practice to a halt.

Here's what you can do if you get a suspicious call:

1.  Pay attention to the pitch. If you have an answering machine, tape the 
conversation.  If not, write it down right away, before you forget, and send 
it to the McGreevey Legal Team by emailing to my address above.

2.  Don't stop the conversation or argue with the caller; get as much 
information as you can.   Try to get the callers' name, organization, 
location or any identifying details.

3.  Save any voice mails or answering machine tapes of the conversation. 
Check to see whether the caller registers on any caller ID devices.

4.  Provide us with your name, contact information (phone, email and mail 
address), including the phone line on which you received the call.  Tell us 
the best time and place to call you.

5.  Be sure to give us the date and time you got the call.

6.  Let us know your age and whether you are registered as a Democrat, 
Republican, or unaffiliated.  This will help us identify the universe to 
which they are calling.

Forward this email or fax it to your friends to let them know about this 
ruse and what they can do to stop it.

If they don't have email, have them write down the requested information and 
fax it to me at 732-404-0478.

Thanking you in advance on behalf of Jim and the entire McGreevey Democratic 
team.
