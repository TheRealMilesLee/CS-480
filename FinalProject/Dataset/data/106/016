I went to the file in the O drive, to the extract tab. IF you filter Enpower west as the portfolio ID and EES-Books-Enpower as the book id, the total PV's value ties to the retail west number that was exported. If you go to the far right on this tab, it says the region detail is East.

I found out where the retail number is coming from. You are picking up an EES West portfolio which is incorrect. That is our test env't only and not in production.

Please see the power export tab information to see the positions and maturity gap numbers being exported to the DPR.  In case you need to see further detail, I have saved the power bench report under O:Dropbox, PWRB_1025_PWR_V@R_NEW.xls.  I will save the power bench report under the dropbox on a daily basis.  Please contact me if you have any questions.  

Thank you,
Susan
