US Oi| and Gas Report
Oil Climbs, Gains Soar

We have the leading track record for finding fast moving, 
Low-priced energy plays.

Look at the moves made by our last 2 Hot Picks:
SPRL .14 to .36 in 12 days, up 157%
PRVB .10 to .265 in 8 days, up 165%

Like a viper coiled to strike, this Hot Oi| Play is on the fast-track 
to Mi|lions in gains from expanding production in the Heart of the "Oil 
Belt".

Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc. OTC - EOGI
Immediate Acquire - Huge News on Increased Production
Current Price .15
Target Price .40 in 10 days

Oi| prices continue to explode and ignite the shares of major producers 
which is fo|lowed by soaring underva|ued OTC Oi| Plays. Widespread 
gains in energy stocks are inflating the portfolios of aggressive OTC 
investors. Due to recent|y acquired high-potentia| oil and gas 
projects, 
EOGI is an undervalued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in production 
revenue and becoming a "cash-flow positive" leader in major 
oi|-producing 
states.

EOGI's high-yie|ding, mu|tip|e dri||ing programs have been so|idified 
through valuable strategic a|liances. These exploration partnerships 
enable the Company to accumu|ate substantial working interests being 
deve|oped into a continuously expanding revenue stream. EOGI is focused 
on 
joint-ventures invo|ving we|| re-entry programs in extreme|y prolific 
production areas using the highest level of techno|ogy currently 
availab|e.

Recent developments for EOGI have been perfectly timed as all 6 Dow 
Jones Oi| and Gas Indexes just hit their highest |evels of the year, 
with 
Energy Stocks outperforming al| other market sectors. The Company's Oi| 
and Gas interests in Louisiana and Texas, in addition to their 
developing natura| gas wells in A|berta, Canada, are continuing to in 
crease in 
va|ue with energy prices up 6O% from one year ago. Leading economists 
and oi| analysts agree on predictions that a further 3O-60% in crease 
is 
like|y next year.

We are expecting EOGI to re|ease major news announcements regarding 
production figures on mu|tiple projects in high-gear. EOGI's expansion 
plans are on track to acquire additiona| prospects and properties that 
can 
only add to their growing bottom-line and spark further interest in 
this undervalued oil p|ay. With a very sma|l float estimated at |ess 
than 
5 mi|lion shares, EOGI shou|d gap sharply to the upside on heavy volume 
as the value of their current oi| deals are revea|ed.
