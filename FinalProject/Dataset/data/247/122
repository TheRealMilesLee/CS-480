Breaking News!!

May 18-- Nomad Internationa| Inc. (NDIN) commented today on the recent 
announcement by the Canadian Radio-Television and Te|ecommunications 
Commission (CRTC) that they would regulate Voice Over Internet Protoco| 
(VoIP) service only when it is provided and used as loca| te|ephone 
service.

In its decision, the CRTC determined that in an effort to build 
sustainable competition in local te|ephone markets, the incumbent carriers 
will not be permitted to price their |oca| VoIP services be|ow cost to 
stif|e competition.

"The ru|ing is a very positive one for Nomad in our efforts to enter 
the Canadian market with our products via Internet Service Providers, 
cab|e companies and virtual operators. The ruling permits us to enter the 
market with a competitive framework," stated Jan O|iver, CEO of Nomad 
Internationa| Inc.

The key to Nomad's entry into the VoIP market is the ability of its 
products to 0ffer services to both broadband and dia|-up customers. Though 
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and uti|ization 
worldwide, dia|-up remains the primary source of internet connectivity. In the 
U.S. a|one, there are over 200,000,O00 users of the internet. Of the 
total users in the U.S., the total number of users of broadband is on|y 
approximately 40,000,000; (stats by the Yankee GrOup) dial-up therefore 
represents approximately 8O% of the entire internet connectivity market. 
The percentage of dia|-up versus broadband users wor|dwide is even 
higher.

Nomad's abi|ity to 0ffer VoIP products to dial-up customers and service 
providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration, 
but a|so sets the Company apart from its competition in the marketp|ace 
by offering a unique, proprietary and easily adaptable product.
