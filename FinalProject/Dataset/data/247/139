<br>I have never cultivated science, more than to fool with some simple
electrical experiments, so I owe nothing to either science or the Demon of
Electricity, so far as I can see

<br>Come here, Eureka! she said<br>I won't, answered the kitten, in a surly
voice But consider, remonstrated the Demon, rising to his feet and speaking
in a pleading voice, consider the years that must elapse before any one else
is likely to strike the Master Key! And, in the meanwhile, consider my
helpless position, cut off from all interest in the world while I have such
wonderful inventions on my hands for the benefit of mankind
If you have no love for science or for the advancement of civilization, DO
have some consideration for your fellow-creatures, and for me! If my
fellow-creatures would have as much trouble with your electrical inventions
as I had, I am doing them a service by depriving them of your devices, said
the boy
