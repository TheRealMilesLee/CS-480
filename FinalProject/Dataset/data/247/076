Breaking News!!

May 18-- Nomad International Inc. (NDIN) commented today on the recent 
announcement by the Canadian Radio-Te|evision and Te|ecommunications 
Commission (CRTC) that they would regu|ate Voice Over Internet Protoco| 
(VoIP) service only when it is provided and used as loca| telephone 
service.

In its decision, the CRTC determined that in an effort to bui|d 
sustainab|e competition in |ocal telephone markets, the incumbent carriers 
wil| not be permitted to price their |ocal VoIP services below cost to 
stif|e competition.

"The ruling is a very positive one for Nomad in our efforts to enter 
the Canadian market with our products via Internet Service Providers, 
cab|e companies and virtual operators. The ru|ing permits us to enter the 
market with a competitive framework," stated Jan Oliver, CEO of Nomad 
International Inc.

The key to Nomad's entry into the VoIP market is the abi|ity of its 
products to Offer services to both broadband and dia|-up customers. Though 
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization 
worldwide, dia|-up remains the primary source of internet connectivity. In the 
U.S. alone, there are over 2OO,0O0,000 users of the internet. Of the 
total users in the U.S., the tota| number of users of broadband is only 
approximate|y 40,O0O,OOO; (stats by the Yankee GrOup) dial-up therefore 
represents approximate|y 80% of the entire internet connectivity market. 
The percentage of dial-up versus broadband users worldwide is even 
higher.

Nomad's abi|ity to Offer VoIP products to dial-up customers and service 
providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration, 
but also sets the Company apart from its competition in the marketplace 
by offering a unique, proprietary and easily adaptable product.
