Dearest,
I have a proposal for you- this however is not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to honour against your will. 
The situation i am presently facing has prompted me to contact you regarding this urgent request of mine. Actually, I am miss Ann Obih the only daughter of my late parents Mr. and Mrs. Obih.
My father was a highly reputable business tycoon-(in the sales of cocoa and cocoa plantation) who operated in the capital of cote d'ivoire during his days.
It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously, as he was piosoned during one of his business trips early last year. Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who went along at that time. 
My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and since then my father took me so special. Prior to the time of his death he told me that he hasthe sum of eight million, seven hundred thousand United State Dollars.(USD$8.700,000) left in one of the leading finance/security company here in Abidjan, Ivory coast West Africa. 
He further told me that he deposited the money in a consignment(box), coded it to the security company as african artifacts, so the security company is not aware that the content of the consignment. He did this for the safety of the money.
I am just 18 years old and a high school undergraduate and really don't know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Cote d'ivoire. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards. Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded.
Now permit me to ask these few questions:- 
1. Can you honestly help me as a guardian? 
2. What proof can you give that i can i completely trust you? 
3.What can i offer you from the total amount in the consignment as a percentage for your assistance in retrieving this consignment from the security company? 
Please, consider this and get back to me as soon as possible. 
Thank you so much.
My sincere regards,
Ann Obih
