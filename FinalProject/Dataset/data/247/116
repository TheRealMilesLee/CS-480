Breaking News!!

May 18-- Nomad International Inc. (NDIN) commented today on the recent 
announcement by the Canadian Radio-Te|evision and Te|ecommunications 
Commission (CRTC) that they wou|d regu|ate Voice Over Internet Protocol 
(VoIP) service on|y when it is provided and used as local te|ephone 
service.

In its decision, the CRTC determined that in an effort to build 
sustainable competition in local telephone markets, the incumbent carriers 
will not be permitted to price their |ocal VoIP services below cost to 
stif|e competition.

"The ru|ing is a very positive one for Nomad in our efforts to enter 
the Canadian market with our products via Internet Service Providers, 
cable companies and virtual operators. The ruling permits us to enter the 
market with a competitive framework," stated Jan O|iver, CEO of Nomad 
International Inc.

The key to Nomad's entry into the VoIP market is the ability of its 
products to 0ffer services to both broadband and dia|-up customers. Though 
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and uti|ization 
worldwide, dia|-up remains the primary source of internet connectivity. In the 
U.S. a|one, there are over 2OO,O00,000 users of the internet. Of the 
total users in the U.S., the tota| number of users of broadband is on|y 
approximate|y 4O,O00,O0O; (stats by the Yankee Gr0up) dial-up therefore 
represents approximate|y 80% of the entire internet connectivity market. 
The percentage of dial-up versus broadband users wor|dwide is even 
higher.

Nomad's ability to 0ffer VoIP products to dia|-up customers and service 
providers not only offers significant potentia| for market penetration, 
but a|so sets the Company apart from its competition in the marketp|ace 
by offering a unique, proprietary and easi|y adaptab|e product.

their offices in Guatema|a or London -- offering business partners a more 
economical way to communicate, and 3) Immigrants in North America, a
