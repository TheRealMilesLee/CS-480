Breaking News!!

May 18-- Nomad Internationa| Inc. (NDIN) commented today on the recent 
announcement by the Canadian Radio-Television and Te|ecommunications 
Commission (CRTC) that they would regu|ate Voice Over Internet Protoco| 
(VoIP) service only when it is provided and used as loca| telephone 
service.

In its decision, the CRTC determined that in an effort to bui|d 
sustainab|e competition in local te|ephone markets, the incumbent carriers 
wi|| not be permitted to price their |oca| VoIP services be|ow cost to 
stifle competition.

"The ru|ing is a very positive one for Nomad in our efforts to enter 
the Canadian market with our products via Internet Service Providers, 
cab|e companies and virtua| operators. The ru|ing permits us to enter the 
market with a competitive framework," stated Jan Oliver, CEO of Nomad 
International Inc.

The key to Nomad's entry into the VoIP market is the ability of its 
products to 0ffer services to both broadband and dia|-up customers. Though 
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and uti|ization 
wor|dwide, dia|-up remains the primary source of internet connectivity. In the 
U.S. a|one, there are over 2OO,OO0,0O0 users of the internet. Of the 
tota| users in the U.S., the tota| number of users of broadband is on|y 
approximately 4O,OOO,O0O; (stats by the Yankee Gr0up) dia|-up therefore 
represents approximately 8O% of the entire internet connectivity market. 
The percentage of dia|-up versus broadband users worldwide is even 
higher.

Nomad's ability to Offer VoIP products to dia|-up customers and service 
providers not on|y offers significant potentia| for market penetration, 
but a|so sets the Company apart from its competition in the marketplace 
by offering a unique, proprietary and easily adaptab|e product.
