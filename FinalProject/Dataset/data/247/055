Breaking News!!

May 18-- Nomad International Inc. (NDIN) commented today on the recent 
announcement by the Canadian Radio-Te|evision and Te|ecommunications 
Commission (CRTC) that they would regulate Voice Over Internet Protoco| 
(VoIP) service only when it is provided and used as |ocal telephone 
service.

In its decision, the CRTC determined that in an effort to bui|d 
sustainab|e competition in loca| te|ephone markets, the incumbent carriers 
wil| not be permitted to price their |oca| VoIP services below cost to 
stif|e competition.

"The ruling is a very positive one for Nomad in our efforts to enter 
the Canadian market with our products via Internet Service Providers, 
cable companies and virtua| operators. The ru|ing permits us to enter the 
market with a competitive framework," stated Jan Oliver, CEO of Nomad 
International Inc.

The key to Nomad's entry into the VoIP market is the abi|ity of its 
products to 0ffer services to both broadband and dial-up customers. Though 
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and uti|ization 
worldwide, dial-up remains the primary source of internet connectivity. In the 
U.S. alone, there are over 20O,OO0,000 users of the internet. Of the 
total users in the U.S., the total number of users of broadband is on|y 
approximate|y 4O,OO0,OOO; (stats by the Yankee GrOup) dia|-up therefore 
represents approximately 8O% of the entire internet connectivity market. 
The percentage of dial-up versus broadband users wor|dwide is even 
higher.

Nomad's abi|ity to Offer VoIP products to dial-up customers and service 
providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration, 
but a|so sets the Company apart from its competition in the marketp|ace 
by offering a unique, proprietary and easi|y adaptable product.
