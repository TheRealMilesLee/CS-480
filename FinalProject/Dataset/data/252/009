I am Peter Hall, head of group risk, of one of the multi-national  banks here in London, England.

On Tuesday, 19 January, 1999, one Dr. H. Paul Jacobi, an American  citizen, made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit, valued at tens of  millions of pounds for twelve calender months in my Bank Branch.
 
Upon Maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding  address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and  finally we discovered from his company that Dr. H. Paul Jacobi was  aboard the ill-fated EgyptAir Flight 990, which crashed into the  Atlantic Ocean on October 31, 1999  (http://www.greatdreams.com/PassEAir990.htm). After further  investigation, it was discovered that he died without making a WILL  and all attempts to trace his next of kin proved fruitless.
 
The total sum is still in my bank and the interest is being rolled  over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever  come forward to claim it.

In accordance with the British banking laws and constitution, at the  expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will be reverted to the British  Government treasury if nobody applies as the BENEFACTOR to claim the  funds. 

Consequently, I shall present you as a foreign partner to stand in as  the BENEFACTOR to the late Dr. H. Paul Jacobi.

If this interests you, reply via my private email address pehall3@excite.com and include your private telephone/fax number as I  guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arrangement that  will protect you from any breach of the law since I will be using my  position as the Bank's head of group risk to secure approvals and  guarantee the successful execution of this transaction.

Further details shall be communicated to you upon receipt of your  favourable response.

Thanks.
 
Best regards,
 
Peter Hall
