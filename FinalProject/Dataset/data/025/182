ATTENTION PLEASE
Dear Friend,
Before I introduce myself and my purpose of contacting you let me first
appeal to you, to kindly read the content of this letter with kind
attention.
I am Mr. patrick ibeh, a banker.
I am the eastern manager of first bank of nigeria(f.b.n), Abuja
branch Nigeria. I want to transfer out $USD 26 million
( TWENTY SIX MILLION U.S DOLLARS) from our bank.
I have the courage to look for a reliable and honest person who will be
capable for this important business,believing that you will never let
me down either now or in future.
There is an account opened in this bank in 1980 and since 1990 nobody
have operated on this account again,after going through some old files
in the records I discovered that if I do not remitte this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.
The owner of this account is Engr. Jack Hamilton , he is a foreigner
and the manager of petrol chemical service,a chemical Engineer by
proffession and he died since 1990, and since then no other person
knows about this account or anything concerning it.secondly he did not
clearify his next of kin in his deposition form when he deposited this
fund in our bank.The account has no other beneficiary and my
investigation proved to me as well that his company does not know
anything about this account and the amount involved is
(U.S.$26,000,000.00)
I want to tranfer this money into a safe foreign account abroad but i
don't know any foreigner,I am contacting you as a foreigner because
this money can not be approved to any local bank here but can only be
approved to a foreign account because the money is in u.s dollars and
the former owner of the account (ENGR. JACK HAMILTON) is a foreigner
too.
I know that this message will come to you as a surprise as we don't
know ourself before,but be sure that it is real and a genuine
business.I believe in god that you will never let me
down in this business,you are the only person that i have contacted for
this business for now,so please reply urgently so that we can receive
this money into a foreign account or any account of your choice where
the fund will be remmited.
I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner with a
foreign account as the real beneficiary,I need your co-operation to
make this work fine,because the management of our bank is ready to
approve this payment to any foreigner who has the correct information
to this account which i will give to you when sure of your capability
to handle such amount with instrict confidence and trust,and according
to my instructions and my advice for our mutual benefit because I don't
want to make any mistake. I need your strong assurance and trust, I
shall also destroy all documents concerning this transactions
immidiately we received this money in your account leaving no trace to
any place. I will use my position and influence on other staffs to
effect legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your
account with appropriate clearance from foreign payment department,with
assurance that this money will be intact pending my physical arrival in
your country for the sharing and other investment.
Finally,at the conclusion of this business,I will give you 25% of the
total amount,70% will be for me ,while 5% will be for expenses both
parties might have incured during the process of this
transaction.Please try and negotiate for me some profitable blue chip
investment opportunities which is risk free which I can invest with
this money when it is transferred to your account and I am interested
in estate management and hotel business, please advise me.

Yours Truly,
mr patrick ibeh
