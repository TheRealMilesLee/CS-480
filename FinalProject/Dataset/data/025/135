Goodday Sir/Madam,

On Sunday December 26th 2004 at about 9:00 am, the world witnessed a natural disaster. A quake measuring 9.0 on the ritcher scale occurred at the bottom of the Indian Ocean close to the Island of Sumatra, North East Indonesia.

Resulting Tsunamis from the quake caused destruction of lives and properties never before experienced in modern history. Reports say this is the strongest quake in 40 years with its energy equal to 9,500 Hiroshima bombs.So far 155,000 people have been officially reported dead, of this figure 27 are Britons, 79,900 Indonesians and 27,268 from Sri Lanka.India recorded over 6,000 dead and Thailand over 10,000. The Swedish Prime Minister says about 1,000 Swedish tourists have died so far, and the death toll is still on the increase.

The British public has so far donated 21million pounds, with 10million raised overnight. The British government has also pledged 15million pounds; the EU has pledged $4m dollars and other International organizations pledging sums of money.

Your financial contribution towards getting medical supplies and food {which are the most important needs} now is highly solicited. We alongside over 30 emergency relief agencies irrespective of race or religion are working in conjunction with the W.H.O to avert an epidemic 
of cholera and other water borne diseases.

Presently,over 5 million people in South Asia are without food or water. The UN health agency requires over 68million pounds to forestall an outbreak of disease in a couple of days, which could be an even bigger disaster.
