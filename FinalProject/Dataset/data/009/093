I understand Diomedes owes Enron around $400,000 in expenses, that we may owe him money under the old ECI agreements and that he has not signed his severance agreement.  I think John and Michelle should discuss the matter and get back to the group with a plan.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
