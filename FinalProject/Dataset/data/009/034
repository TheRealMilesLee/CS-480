Eric mentioned you two would be willing to help on the initial analysis for Questar So. Trails.  Below is the preliminary data I received last week.  I will be out travelling until Monday 7/23 but let's re-group mon / tues next week and talk about preparing the indicative offer.  Eric wants to pitch the offer early August.  Please feel free to page me at 888-582-7421 or leave me a voicemail with questions.  
thanks
