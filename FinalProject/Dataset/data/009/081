MR ALLEN SHALOMAI
BILLS AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,
AMALGAMATED BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA(A.B.S.A)
JOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA.
Reply to allenshalomai@yahoo.co.in

Dear Friend,
I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign
remittance department 
of Amalgmated Bank of South Africa here in Johannesburg,
South Africa.In my department we discovered an abandoned
sum of US$10m dollars (TEN Million US dollars) in an
account that belongs to one of our foreign customer (MR.
ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany) who died along with
his entire family in Jully 2000 in a plane crash.
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm
Since we got information about his death, we have been
expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot
release it unless 
some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the
deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but
unfortunately we learnt that 
all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside
with him at the 
plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is
therefore upon this 
discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal
to you and 
release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to
the deceased for 
safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming
for it and we 
don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as
unclaimed bill.
The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such
money remained 
unclaimed after fours years, the money will be transfered
into the bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as
next of kin in this 
business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a
foreigner and a South African cannot stand as next of kin
to a foreigner.
I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect
to the provision 
of a foriegn account , 10% will be set aside for expenses
incurred during 
the business and 60% would be for me Thereafter, I will
visit your country 
for disbursement according to the percentage indicated
Therefore, to enable 
the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you
must apply first to 
the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased
indicating your bank 
name, your bank account number, your private telephone and
fax number for 
easy and effective communication and location where in the
money will be 
remitted.
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or
email the text of 
the application . I will not fail to bring to your notice
this transaction 
is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of
fear as all 
required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You
should contact me 
immediately as soon as you receive this letter.
Trusting to hear from you immediately.For security resons
kindly reply to only allenshalomai@yahoo.co.in

Yours Faithfully,
Mr. Allen Shalomia
AMALGAMATED BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA
