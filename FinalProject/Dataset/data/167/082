Dear Phil Platter,

Thank you for your gift of $100.00 to The September 11th Fund.  The Fund was established by United Way of New York City and The New York Community Trust to respond to the immediate and longer-term needs of victims, their families, and communities affected by the tragic events of September 11, 2001.

Within 11 days of the attacks, checks were being written to victims and their families by experienced relief agencies using cash grants from The September 11th Fund.  Right now, your contribution is helping to provide emergency cash assistance, legal counseling, grief therapy, job training and placement, and other vital services for victims, families and others directly affected. Your gift is helping people and communities rebuild their lives.  

On behalf of Joshua Gotbaum, chief executive officer of The September 11th Fund, we invite you to visit http://www.september11fund.org for up-to-date information and to sign up for e-mail updates on how your contribution to The September 11th Fund is helping to fund recovery efforts.

If your employer has a matching gift program for The September 11th Fund and requires verification of your gift, this e-mail will serve as that verification.  Please contact your company's human resource or community affairs department if you have any questions. 

Again, thank you for your continued support of The September 11th Fund and of community foundations and United Ways across the country.

Sincerely,


Ralph Dickerson, Jr.
President
United Way of New York City
