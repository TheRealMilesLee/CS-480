From Mr.Steven Mark.

Dear Sir,

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this by virtue=

of its nature that is utterly confidential and secret. Though I know that=

a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worrie=
d,
but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. I deci=
ded
to contact you due to the fact that this transaction is urgent, as I will=

rely on your ability in handling a transaction of this nature.

Let me start by introducing myself properly to you. I am Mr. Steven Mark,=

I work with the Asba Bank SA as an account officer in the Treasury/Credit=

Control Unit. I came to know you in private search for a reliable and rep=
utable
person to handle this confidential transaction, which involve the transfe=
r
of a huge sum of money into a foriegn account requiring maximum confidenc=
e.

THE NATURE OF THE PROPOSITION / TRANSACTION: A foreigner by name Andreas
Schranner , who is a real estate and property developer  by profession do=
es
some his banking transaction with us at Asba Bank and had a closing balan=
ce
as at the end of January 2002, which is worth Fifteen Million  United Sta=
tes
Dollars .

I was his personal account officer and since he deposited this money with=

us in the year 1999,  We were instructed by my late client that the money=

be kept and secured in a security and finance firm because it was less ex=
pensive
to keep and secure the funds in the security firm devoid of tax payments.=


I am sad to inform you  that Mr  Andreas Schranner and his wife died in t=
he
ill fated concorde flight AF4590 that crashed  into Hotelisimmo on the 31=
st
of July 2000 in Paris-France . check this website below:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm

Our bank now expects his Next of Kin to come forward as a sole beneficiar=
y
to his assets with the bank, mean while, as is personal account officer v=
aluable
efforts has being made by me for more than one year to get in touch with
any of my late client family or relatives without any success. It is beca=
use
of the percieved impossibility of being able to locate any of my late cli=
ent
Next of Kin as his wife Maria Schranner and his daughter Eich Andreas per=
ished
in the flight also. Based on this, I secretly seek advice from a fellow c=
oleague
who has being in banking for about 14 years now about this issue of my la=
te
client , he made me
understand that things like this do happen and at the end of the day the
chairman and board of directors of the bank will declare the funds as ''
Unclaimed '' and subsequently divert it for thier personal use. In order
to avert this negetive development, I now seek your permission to have yo=
u
stand as the Next of Kin to my late client, so that the funds  will be re=
leased
and paid into your account as the beneficiary Next of Kin.

I have already secured from the probate, as soon as I recieve an acknowle=
dgement
of your acceptance, I will furnish you with the necessary modalities of t=
he
transaction. I assure you that this transcaction is 100% risk free, and a=
s
soon as we succeed in getting this funds to your account, The money will
be shared on a 50-50 basis .

Please forward to me on acceptance of this proposal, your private telepho=
ne
and fax number including the country code and area codes, your complete n=
ames,and
private email address ( SteveMark962@netscape.net ) for effective  commun=
ication
as the project will be completed within the next 14 working days.

Thanks.

Best Regards.

Steven Mark.
