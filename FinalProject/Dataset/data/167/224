inflated invoice, from a contract awarded to one of our Aviation Authority 
contractor.
The contract has been already executed and the original contractor had 
collected his full and final payment. In as much as, this contract was 
awarded to a Foreign Contractor, and the payment is in dollars, I now, need 
a Foreigner that will present himself as the contractor and beneficiary for 
this amount of Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars 
(US$18,500,000.00).  And then the fund will be transferred into your 
account. Since I do not want to use the original contractor in applying for 
the payment, because the Contractor is not aware of this over-invoiced sum. 
THIS MONEY IS ALREADY COVERED WITH SOUTH AFRICA CIVIL AVIATION AUTORITY 
CONTRACT NUMBER AND COMPLETE COMPLETION NUMBER AND WHICH MAKES IT EASIER FOR 
US TO EFFECT THIS TRANSFER.

Therefore, I as the Financial Controller was told to write you by my 
colleagues and see to the success of the remittance immediately, you would 
however, be required, to furnish Me with these necessary information.

1. You’re secure phone and fax numbers for easy communication
2. You’re full home and work address,
3. Photocopies of you’re Identification:, Your Drivers license, or your 
international passport or national ID. This is to add your name into our 
DATA/BASE system as the original contractor.

And the information, will enable ME put APPLICATION OF CLAIM for the release 
of this money from concerned Government Agencies and it will last for ten 
working days. For your assistance I have agreed that the funds will be 
shared as follows:

We would be offering you 25%. Of the total amount,  for providing to us 
Account and for your kind assistance. %5 has been map out for any expenses 
that we might encore during the process of this transfer. Members of 
Officials, that Involved into this transaction, will have the remaining 70%. 
For investment purposes, which you will guide, and introduce to us a 
profitable business. Sine we have never been into any business all our life.

also been put to place to effect this transaction.
Thanking you in anticipation for your most urgent and positive response.

Yours faithfully

KHUMALO JAMES. (DR)
