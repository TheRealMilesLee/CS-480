Last night's kick-off for the Children's Book Drive was a huge success.  We had a fantastic turn-out, raised $970 and collected three boxes full of books.  Many people wrote personal inscriptions in the books to the children reminding them that they were in our thoughts and prayers.  Enron Corp has offered to match our contributions 2 to 1, making the total contribution from the pool $2,910.  

The drive is not over yet!  We will accept books and cash until September 28th.  You can come by and visit us on the 35th floor to make a donation.  

We are looking forward to seeing everyone in October for our Halloween Social!  This event is going to be hosted by EGM.  Stay tuned for more details.

Thanks again for a fantastic evening.  


Sincerely, 

Traci Warner
