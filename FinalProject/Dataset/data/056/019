Gearing up for first move-in to the new building. My mom also had a stroke in the spring and that's taking huge amounts of time. I'm hanging in there. Certainly can't complain in these times.

Hope you're doing well.

Hey Chris, what is going on?  I haven't talked to you is some time now.  Still staying really busy?

Just a note to say hi.  Hope everything is well.  

Talk to you soon.
