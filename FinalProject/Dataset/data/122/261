Commercial Risk Reinsurance is very well known and reputable, according to
the BoA insurance portfolio manager.
We do see ACA a lot through our muni derivatives business.  They will insure
lower rated credits (A- to BBB-, and some below that) who are seeking an A
rating but do not want to pay for a AAA rating.  Should be fine from our
standpoint.
