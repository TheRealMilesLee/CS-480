Folks,

Good work on the documents that you've pulled together to get to Nicor and to Shell Capital.  I have added the Letter of Interest along with slightly modified versions of the others attached.  Review, make any minor changes, and let's get these out to Shell Capital (Risks & Mitigants, Schedule) and Nicor (Letter of Interest, Letter of Intent, and Schedule) today.  I would have Gerald take a look at the Letter of Interest prior to sending it to make sure that I didn't mis-represent anything.  Sorry about the hold up on my end from being on the road.

    
Thanks,
Chris Hilgert
