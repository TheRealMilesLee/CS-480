As discussed, key members of the Enron Wholesale Services Tax Group have been approached by recruiters and competitors about opportunities outside of Enron.  I have received 4 calls in the past 24 hours.  Listed below are the key people comprising the Enron Wholesale Services Tax Planning Group, in addition to myself, who possess significant institutional knowledge of Enron's tax position and whose continued employment with Enron (regardless of its altered state) is critical.  For example, Morris Clark and Jeff Blumenthal were key members of the team that, with me, designed and implemented Project Slapshot, the continued maintenance of which stands to provide Enron with over $100 million of tax savings.  I have not spoken with other members of the Enron Tax Department about this matter and, rather, I have come to you to obtain proper guidance since the continued employment of the below listed employees directly affects my ability to manage the EWS tax position.  As you can appreciate, time is of the essence.  I look forward to speaking with you.

Senior Directors:

	Morris Clark
	Kevin Liss
	Susan Musch
	Bret Wells

Directors:

	Jeff Blumenthal

Specialist:

	Melanie Hutchinson
