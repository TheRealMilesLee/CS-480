Mr. Lay,
Just wanted to let you know that we're keeping the faith, and wish you all the best in your endeavor to pull Enron out of this current predicament. And that we're working as hard as ever to make sure that Enron remains the pioneering innovative company that it is. Sincerely hope everything ends favorably. 

Warm Regards, good luck and God bless.
