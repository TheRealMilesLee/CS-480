Greg, I can not even imagine all the tension and activity that have kept you
busy these past weeks. Maybe you can give me a call when the dust settles a
little. Sunday PM might be good, I will be at home. There is nothing
critical just thought you might want to vent. Liz has been a champ and if
anything went critical I would let her know.
Cash margins are getting thin with all the rate cuts, but you are liquid and
getting the best available. Ben
