SE RTO:  FERC heard a presentation of the report by the ALJ at the Oct. 24 FERC meeting.  The Commissioners stated that they plan to take some action at the next meeting on Nov 7.

ICAP:  On Oct 17, Enron filed its response opposing the continuation of icap as a separate product.  Awaiting FERC action.

Dynegy v. ComEd:  On Oct 26, Enron filed a protest against Dynegy's protest of ComEd's current practice allowing Firm LD contracts to be designated as network resources for the Illinois retail program.  Dynegy argues that only "capacity" contracts should be allowed to used.  Awaiting FERC action.

Christi - Would you please update me on the following issues.  I am putting together Jim's November report, and any new information (if there is any) on the SE RTO and FERC-ICAP project would be helpful.  Thanks so much, Bryan
