AN OPEN LETTER TO  MUSLIMS ONLY.
(A Message For Peace And Reconciliation)

Dear Brothers and Sisters,

God forbid if any one of our near one and dear one is killed then the 
killer is evil, a beast and what not and should get penalty but if 
one among us kills anybody then he is not evil and we start finding 
justifications behind killing.... double standards?

Being Muslims, many of our brothers and sisters are not working for 
peace. They are misguided, mistaken and spreading the poison of 
hatred and revenge through disinformation and false accusations, 
which is resulting in death and miseries for number of innocent 
people living around the world at the hands of merciless KILLER 
MUSLIMS and also bringing bad name to MOHAMMED (PBUH) who never 
killed anyone in his life time.

Instead of teaching about Good & Evil, certain Radical Muslim Clerics 
are only "Trading in Religion". They teach us about accusing, abusing 
and killing the non-Muslims. They try to hypnotize us to Hate and 
Kill the non-Muslims and brethren of other sects or be killed and 
without using any common sense, we readily believe in whatever is 
being said by these Hate Mongers.  Actually, they are "Agents of 
Satan" who is paying them heavily and in return they are cutting at 
the very roots of the Ummah. Instead of "Mourning" most of the 
Muslims are rejoicing on the brutal killings of the non-combatant 
innocent civilians and "The Murderers" have always been "Our Great 
Heroes".

Before it is too late and the Curse Of God falls upon us, we should 
use common sense, find out the truth and wakeup to save Muslims from 
becoming the most "Hated, Isolated, Discredited and Suspicious" 
people in the world. We must start working for promoting "Sectarian 
Harmony and Religious Tolerance" in the society and should prove to 
the WORLD through our deeds that MOHAMMED (PBUH) teaches "Love & 
Peace" and not Gangsterism, Terrorism, Extremism, Sectarianism, 
Cruelty, Inhumanity and "Hatred & Killing" of the innocent civilians.


Islam is a religion of peace. Islam teaches respect and love for all 
even the animals. But many narrow-minded Muslims have so far failed 
to learn anything from the teachings of Mohammed (PBUH). We are far 
away from the basic principle of Islam i.e. "Enjoining the people to 
do Good and forbidding them from Doing Evil". Unfortunately, most of 
us remember only one thing to be called as good Muslims and that is 
to "hate" the non-Muslims".

The killing of others in the name of religion is a Sin. Can a FATHER 
ever teach his Children to be the permanent Enemies of each other?

MY PRAYER FOR PEACE:

Merciful God, please give to peoples of the world, the required 
wisdom and determination, to Forgive and Forget the bitterness of the 
past and learn to live in peace like brothers and sisters, by ending 
the divisions and hatreds created in us by our past and present 
elders. (Amen)

Please acknowledge receipt and write for any clarification or further 
guidance.

Thanking you,
S.A.Rehman
Peace Activist
