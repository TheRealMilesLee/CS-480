Stacey and Peggy,  could you help me in obtaining Tim's signature on the attached authorized trader list.  We need to get specific information on those individuals that are authorized to trade with brokers.  We have received some recent requests for the updated list from brokers.  Can you look over the list and let me know if there are any changes and if you can identify those individuals as well as the brokers (by firm name) that they are authorized to trade with?  Any assistance you can provide is greatly appreciated.  Please call me with any questions at ext. 31939.  Thanks. Donna Lowry

Enclosed for your review and approval (with necessary modifications) is the most recent authorized trader list.  RAC Compliance will forward all future requests for this information to you on a quarterly basis.  If any changes occur to this list during the interim period, please follow the requirements in the Risk Management Policy and forward a new list to my attention at EB 2407.

Additionally, we will be compiling appropriate trader list for brokers by product.  Please indicate either on the attached list or provide a separate list indicating those individuals authorized to trade with a broker along with the firm name.

If you have any questions regarding this process or the attached, please contact me at extension 3-1939.
