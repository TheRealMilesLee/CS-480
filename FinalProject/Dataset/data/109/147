Lynn & Raetta,  In a conference call with Frank Semin, Courtney Barker, Gary Anderson and Ellis Stern today it was discussed on how the end of the month volumes have been estimated in the past dealing with 16 and 31 days charts.  Also, it was discussed on how this affects DDVC and other penalties that are billed from a Gas Logistics perspective.  Frank is needing to respond to MidAmerican on how NNG actualizes daily volume at their untelemetered (chart/index) end user points.  Frank would like to schedule a meeting with Gas Logistics, Marketing (Dave Neubauer), GMS (Gary Anderson, Ellis Stern) to discuss the end user agreements and the procedures that GMS uses when determining actual flow at the end user points.  Frank wants all parties within ETS to be aware of some to the issue involved in this process.  

Lynn & Raetta,  could you schedule some time to discuss.  I would like to bring you up to speed on the previous conversations and calls that I have had with Marketing, MidAmerican and GMS on this subject. 

I will be out of the office on Wed and Fri. this week if that helps.  I'm pretty flexible other than that.   Give me a call if you have any questions
