To Our Readers:

Here's the latest on Operation Enduring Freedom and the anthrax cases at
home:

U.S. warplanes attacked Taliban targets along Afghanistan's border with
Tajikistan for the first time in an attempt to take out artillery used to
disrupt a Northern Alliance supply route.

For the first time since 1935, the U.S. Supreme Court won't be hearing
cases in its historic chambers, after anthrax was discovered at a facility
that sorts the high court's mail.
