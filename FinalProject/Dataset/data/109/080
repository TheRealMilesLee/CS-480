All:

	There is a fourth candidate who will be calling you to schedule time to interview for the ETS CIO position.  His name is Richard Burchfield.  We would like for Richard to interview at the earliest oppotunity.  Once he has done so, I will coordinate a meeting among Steve, Danny, Rod, Shelley, and Phil to see which one or two of the candidates should move on to interview with Stan Horton and Mark Pickering.  I would like to accomplish that by the end of the week if possible.

Brian
