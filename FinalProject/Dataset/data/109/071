Jim,

It is very understandable that you and Patsy might want to be on terra firma considering the challenges and assorted emotions and needs related to the flood, the fire, and the planes. I certainly wish you both well and hope that the new home is everything you want and need it to be. Please submit your letter of resignation as soon as you want to. I know that all of us appreciate and value your contributions to the Board and to the
Spires. I'm delighted to see that you will still be participating in the Spire's Holiday Party.

Paula

Planes, fires, and floods along with my inability to use the stairs as a means of escape plus her desire to be "back on the ground" again add up to our moving into a one story patio styled home in a neighborhood just a couple of miles east of San Antonio !
