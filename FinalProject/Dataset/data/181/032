Umbrella is still requiring this type of information to be scheduled.  Although our position is currently not to provide it, we may alter the position and I am trying to get a head start since the time frames are shortening.  They will eventually want this on all counterparties, but we can start with the top twenty.  Further, early next week Andy Alter wants to discuss how we will contract initially.  Mark Taylor and I will discuss this with him, but it will be vital to have contact information ready sooner rather than later.  Thanks for your help.

Louise: 

At Mary Cook's request, we have prepared, and attach for your review, an address list for our top 20 trading counterparties.  Please note that we do not have contact information for the following counterparties:

BP Corporation North America Inc. - physical gas 
Entergy-Koch - physical power 
TXU Energy Trading Company - financial 

If you can provide us with contact information, we can include it in the attached list. 

Mary asked that you provide us with any changes/additions by 12:00 on Wednesday, January 2. 

Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else. 

Thanks! 

Marie
