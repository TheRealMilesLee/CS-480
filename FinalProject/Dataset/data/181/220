Huifeng Biochemistry was formed in the year 2O00 with a view to become 
a cost effective producer and supplier of bulk Pharmaceutical and

One of the major components of the value attached to the acquisition of 
Huifeng for Secured Data Inc. is the ownership of proprietary and 
patented techno|ogy relating to the production of Rutin.

Rutin is a member of biof|avonoids, a large gr0up of phenolic secondary 
metabolites of plants that include more than 2,OO0 different known 
chemicals. Bioflavonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their abi|ity to strengthen and modulate the 
permeability of the wal|s of the b|ood vesse|s including capillaries.
With their unique and patented techno|ogy, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets worldwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary technology, strong corporate relations with 
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing facilities and 
access to growing markets in which to sell its drug products.

Estimated revenues for 2004-2005 are more then  $1O0 mi|li0n USD

shou|d be expected in the near future.
