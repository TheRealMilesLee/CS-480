INVESTOR ALERT - IMMEDIATE RELEASE - INVESTOR ALERT
Breakout Forecast March-April 2005
Quest Oil Corp. QOIL Quest Oil Corp. 
CURRENT PRICE $0.25
Projection 5 to 7 Days -------$0.40 - $0.42
Projection 12 to 18 Days------$0.90 - $1.00 
QUEST OIL'S MISSION IS TO DELIVER A COMPETITIVE AND SUSTAINABLE RATE OF RETURN FOR THEIR SHAREHOLDERS BY ACQUIRING, EXPLORING AND DEVELOPING OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES AR0UND THE W0RLD.

Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bull market, our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.

Quest Oil Corporation (QOIL) has targeted oil and gas exploration in both North America and Internationally. The company is focused on acquiring quality oil and gas properties in regions that provide economically and politically stable environments. 

Domestic Oil and Gas Exploration.

How much it will up again? 2 times..? 3 times or more..?

In addition to Quest's oil and gas exploration and production, technology is another significant focus of the company. The acquisition and development of technology related to the exploration and production of oil and gas is a vital element of Quest Oil's business, and plays central role in our operations. The role of technology in the oil and gas market is critical and provides a strategic advantage to the future of Quest Oil.

Quest Oil Corporation was carefully developed through determination and hard work.

By evaluating their risks and maintaining a strict ethical standard. The Quest team has successfully provided excellent value to its shareholders.

BIG GAINS IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY

Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the overall market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized explorers and developers like QOIL that the biggest gains are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particularly close attention to undervalued QOIL shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This small company with a comparably small| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially with the daily jump in energy prices.

But all that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to capture the attention of the market, and have an equally explosive effect on the share price.

What will the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Quest Oils' shares? 

Well we do know this - the great thing about investing in QOIL is that your gains don't depend on further increases in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or decline slightly, you can still make a very healthy return. 

Of course, energy prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year or so as predicted, meaning the value of QOIL's assets and earnings will soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be staggering.

Overall, we consider QOIL to be one of the last outstanding energy plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized, QOIL shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. QOIL's oil and gas reserves are well established and are going into massive production.

Early investors will secure optimum gains, and any additional news in this area will really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets upward in next week's bulletin
