Mark:

Just thought I'd touch base with you to see if there is a convenient time for us to get together this week so that I can bring you up to speed on what I've been doing since my arrival. As you know, I was supposed to be in Tuscany this week and part of next but the trip has been cancelled due to my father's health. If it is okay with you, I would still like to be out of the office this Thursday and Friday because my daughter will be out of school.

I will be here and available to meet with you at your convenience today up until about 3:00 and tomorrow from 8:30 until 4:00. On Wednesday, GSS is having their quarterly business review and I have been asked to attend that. 

Please let me know (a) if my proposed time out of the office is okay with you and (b) if and when you would like to meet this week.

Thanks-

Kim
