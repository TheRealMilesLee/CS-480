Subject: Deer Lease Report

Talked to Chris and Mertz this am.

Mertz saw some decent deer today. Still hot out there

McComb had a shitty 24 hours. Scrambler out of gas wanted to blam on us.
I 
pointed out we used it for about hlaf an hour, only. then he got one
flat 
tire in his suburban.
three feeders are down, one was booger which should have been repaired. 
Looks like it should work, but it has fed three times since sept. Bone
yard 
not working. Hideout not working. Those may be battery issues. the other
7 
stands are working and he filled them up.

his friends shot lots of doves at the trailer sun evening. Zander said
his 
bother shot a bunch a few weeks ago while picking stuff off their lease.

Chris said they were swarming around the trailer at sunset. Chris hunted

lone star brush pile sun evening, missed a spike and a turkey. saw a
good 
deer walking out.

he got another flat tire 13 miles away from llano at 9:30 pm. sherriff
was 
the only one he could get to help. a tow truck towed his truck back to 
austin. he had his daughter with him. he got home at 1 am. he says his
wife 
may not let him go back.

doubtful keith will get out there next weekend to fix those feeders.
we'll 
have to fix them up on openning weekend.
