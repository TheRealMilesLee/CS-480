Vince:  I understand that you had expressed an interest in this candidate some time ago.  He was placed at TXU by Paul Weinberg when Paul was associated with an agency.  Paul is now recruiting with us, and has been back in touch with Valery, who says that he would be very interested in talking with you and your group.  Please let me know if I can be of any assistance to you with arranging interviews, etc.

Molly
