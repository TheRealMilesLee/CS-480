Before Marketing Firm Night, be sure to check out the second speaker in HTC's Haas Fall Technology Speaker Series!

What's all this buzz about data storage?
Is this really a growth industry?
Who are the players?
Then we invite you to...



"The Future of Data Storage"
Kris Hagerman, SVP Strategic Operations, Veritas Software 

Date: Thursday, October 25th
Time: 5:30 to 7:00 p.m. with refreshments from 5:00 p.m.
Location: Cheit 220




If you're curious about storage, here's a link to a HaasWeek article I wrote last spring on storage. The numbers are dated, but the info is the same. Just click on Haas Happens and go to Tech Talk II.
