New credit has been established for deemed ISDAs.  AIG...Ltd will be getting a deemed ISDA confirmation setting their independent amount to $570,000.  AIG LP will be getting one setting their independent amount at $150,000.

Michelle Nelson needs to be immediately informed when c/p's agree to changes in independent amount so that the confirmations can be properly prepared and the margin team can do their work.

If in your view either Ltd or LP is expecting independent amounts different from those above, it is imperative that you immediately inform me and Marie Heard (she is preparing the updated confirmations).  

By copy of this email, I am asking Marie to hold off sending out the credit until this afternoon in order to give you time to respond.

Paul
