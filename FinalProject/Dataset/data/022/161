FROM: DR FELIX ZUMA: 
DEPT OF AVIATION, JOHANNESBURG, 
SOUTH AFRICA 
felixzuma12@yahoo.com
TEL  27 83 5852071
SIR 

PROPOSAL FOR TRANSFER OF EIGHTEEN MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS (US$18.5M)INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. 

I need your reliability and trustworthiness in this transaction. I am the 
FINANCIAL CONTROLLER of the DEPARTMENT OF AVIATION,JOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA and Secretary to the Contract Award Committee of my DEPARTMENT.I have concluded arrangements to transfer out of this Country through the RESERVE BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA some amount and we will together later reinvest it abroad after the success of this transaction. The amount involved is Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars (US$18,500,000.00). This is as a result of over inflated amount of a contract. The contract has been already executed and the original contractor had collected his full and final payment. In as much as this contract was awarded to a Foreign Contractor and the payment is in dollars, I now need a Foreigner that will present himself as the contractor and beneficiary for this amount of 
Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars (US$18,500,000.00) and 
then the fund will be transferred into your account. Since I do not want to use the original contractor in applying for the payment, because the Contractor is not aware of this over-invoiced sum. THIS MONEY IS ALREADY COVERED WITH DEPARTMENT OF AVIATION CONTRACT NUMBER AND COMPLETE COMPLETION NUMBER AND WHICH MAKES IT EASIER FOR US TO EFFECT THIS TRANSFER. 

Therefore, I as the Financial Controller was told to write you by my colleagues and see to the success of the remittance immediately, you will however, be required to furnish ME with these necessary information. 
1. Your secure phone and fax numbers for easy communication 
2. Name and Address of Bank, Phone, Fax and Telex numbers 
3. Account number where this money will be transferred into, It could be new personal or corporate account set up    for this purpose. 
4. The beneficiary name, company or personal name. 

These information will enable ME put APPLICATION OF CLAIM for the release of 
this money from concerned Government Agencies and it will last for ten working days. For your assistance I have agreed that the funds will be shared as follows: 

You as the Account provider 20% (YOU) 
Miscellaneous Expenses 10% 
Officials Involved 70% 
We assure you that all arrangements have been concluded for the success of this transaction, so if you are interested, reply ME IMMEDIATELY. 

Yours faithfully 

Felix Zuma (DR
