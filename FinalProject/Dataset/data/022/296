At John Sherriff's suggestion we have scratched Russia from the "area of 
opportunity" list and substituted Spain. After talking to Gavyn, he and I 
agreed that Oscar Fanjul, formerly of Repsol and now with Goldman and others, 
knows more about this subject than anyone, so he will cover Spain and Tim 
Plaut will do Germany (resumes will be faxed to Rosalee as soon as I have 
them. Because of Oscar's schedule (must leave by 10:30 AM) we should put this 
item first on the agenda.
