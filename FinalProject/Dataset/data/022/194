I shouldn't have any problems - just let me know when the annuity is entered - then I will check it out with Kathy at El Paso each month and included it in our total sales to them on the bill - Thanks - A

If you have any questions on the El Paso Electric stuff that we have just implemented, please let me know.

We will be making a monthly physical annuity for the Scheduling fee

Kathy from EPE has requested that it not be a separate line item on the invoice, just blended in with the rest of the amount owed.

Thanks,

Cara
