Hello, Pat and I were thinking it would be nice to have a wedding shower
bbq for Alice and Jeff. I talked to Alice and Saturday, September 8th
woul be the best date. The 29th is a backup date. How does the 8th work
for you all.
    I thought maybe we could the normal bbq and have a cake. Maybe for
the gift we could all put in money and buy something substanial. What
are your thoughts?  kari
