Roman - here's the list of up and running wind in the Northeast:

operating in New England: very little to work with, yet.
- Searsburg (VT); owned by Green Mountain Power; you should already have
the
contacts from EPA Chelmsford;
- Princeton Municipal Light Plant - small wind farm (10 x 40 kW turbines),
output of repowering of one of turbines already committed to a green
retailer; unlikely anything available, but contact is Jon Fitch,
jfitch@pmld.com, (978) 464-2815
- Endless Energy has put up two small turbines at customer locations in
Maine; used on-site.
- Burlington (VT) Electric Department has a small (50 kW) turbine part of
the generation mix of the utility not sure they would or could resell.

operating in NY:
- Weathersfield project (near Buffalo) - Ontario Power Generation has
contractual control of the green attributes: contact Murray Paterson @
(416)
592-4940, murray.paterson@ontariopowergeneration.com
- Fenner Project (near Syracuse) - developed by Atlantic Renewable Energy
Corp.; owned by CHI energy; contact Bill Moore at AREC @ (301) 407-0424,
Bill.moore@Atlantic-renewable.com (if you do, please let him know I sent
you).
- Madison Project (near Syracuse) - contact PG&E National Energy Group,
either Muir Davis (301) 280-6830, muir.davis@neg.pge.com; or Jane
Hotchkiss-Gordy, 203/453-6985 , JHGordy@snet.net

Under construction: Hull Municipal Light Plant, one 660kW turbine will be
up
by the end of Autumn.  Will be used to serve town load; have not in the
past
shown interest in selling ( I know green marketers who have approached them
and had no luck).

Has permits but not yet constructed: Berkshire Wind Project, western MA -
contact Dale Osborn, DisGen, @ (303) 674-2551, Daleosb@msn.com.

a few other projects are currently seeking permits.  Let me know if you are
interested.


Regards,

Bob Grace

provider.  any connections you could / would want me to get them talking,
please let me know.

You all should have received an announcement for the upcoming wind
workshops
October 24 and 25  at the Boston Radisson... I am just checking a sample to
make sure that the e-mail distribution of the attached announcement had
worked properly.  Please let me know if you have not previously received
this; and sorry for any duplication.

Regards,

Bob Grace
