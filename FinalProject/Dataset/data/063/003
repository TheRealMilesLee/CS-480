Mary Kay asked me to relay the following comments.  Elizabeth suggested I put them in an E-mail so that the Houston group could discuss sat 3:30.

1.  Item #1 PDT record (roughly page 109)
On TI contract #26849 for 8/18/2001-8/20/2001, report shows scheduled & delivered  volume of 1068 with NO nominated volume.
Elizabeth suspects that this was manually scheduled overrun.  
If that is the case, Mary Kay recommends that you make the Nominated column match the volume in the Scheduled column.

2.  Item #3 Footnote #3
Mary Kay suggested the following wording.  Do you agree that this describes what happened?
She is assuming that this was still related to the Force Majeur with Gallup being down, since Operating Capacity went down
from 8/19 to 8/20 then back up on 8/21.

"After operating for a day under the Force Majeure, physical mainline capacity was adjusted based on operating conditions."
