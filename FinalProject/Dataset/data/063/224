Jim, I spoke with Seab briefly on the current budget.  As you are aware, the initial budget scope for the CA proceeding was rather limited, and a significant portion of that budget was a "catch all"- actually relating to the PAC NW proceeding and various trips to Houston and DC.  Watkiss sees a more expanded role developing for Seab in the CA proceeding, given the issues and options that are arising.  I have asked Seab to give us a breakdown of where we are right now on the current budget.  I plan to meet with Seab and Watkiss next Wednesday to discuss scope of services further, and will get back to you.  Ray
