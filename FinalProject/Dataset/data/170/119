If we haven't already, can we approach all and ask them to sign. That is all we can do. If the refuse, please write down an explanation and send to Michelle. I may have been under the mistaken impression that we had already done this.

I've went through the current list and provided the dates of those who have accepted the certificate of compliance.  The people in blue have not complied.  While I was at it, I looked to ensure all these people are still active employees.  The four in red have withdrawn and their termination date is listed for you.  
 
David, the one bolded in red received a retention payment but was terminated due to reduction in force on 12/14/01...???
 
Let me know if you need anything else.
Kathy
