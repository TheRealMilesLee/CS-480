Hello!  
I hope you had a good weekend and are settling back into your work week.

I know I wrote you before, but just realized that my profile was hidden. I won't repeat myself again, but if you could take a minute and read about me on my profile.  You look familiar to me...did you go to CU?  I'm a Boulder Native and I graduated from CU in May '90. Anyhow, I'd be interested in learning more about you!

Hope you have a good evening!
Boulder Girl

The following is my profile text:

I am a fun, creative, honest, grounded, outgoing Colorado native, CU grad and work in advertising. I love Colorado and enjoy the beauty of my state everyday driving to work looking at the Flatirons. I am lucky to be culturaly diverse and well traveled. Although I am not very athletic, I do enjoy spectator sports but prefer the cultural arts. My friends describe me loyal and true blue.
