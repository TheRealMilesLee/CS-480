Please begin sending the Phillips Petroleum statements to me at the
following e-mail address (jahartn@ppco.com).  Jennifer Littau is no longer
the accountant handling these properties.  Jennifer has forwarded the
November statements to me, but I would appreciate your sending them to me
directly in January.  If you have any questions, please feel free to
contact me.

Thank you for your assistance.
