So we received a December distribution from Sithe (a whopping 5,773,015.15).  This is for the TCC and Equity distribution.  We also were paid the first interest installment on December 1 (another 14,715,082)  So total we have received over $23 million this year (and we didn't make the $2.75 million payment to DYN on Dec 1).  Much better than proforma.  Interestingly the TCC adjustment for the October and November reduced Sithe's distribution by nearly $2 million.  OUCH.  Chuck
