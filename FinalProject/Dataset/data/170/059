Hey,

Got your email, I'm sorry your weekend didn't turn out as well as you might have expected, at least that's the message I'm getting.  I thought about you this weekend when the weather turned out to be nice, and we had fresh snow on Saturday night.  I hope you didn't get hurt skiing.

I think I'm skiing tomorrow.  There isn't anything going on around here and probably won't be for awhile.  Our boss was here Friday night for our Christmas party.  He thought once everything was finalized we would like this new deal.  So I hope he's right, it's still way too early to tell.

I'll try and call you this evening.  I'm looking forward to the conversation.  Remember keep your sarcasm in check, you know how sensitive I am.

Topics Open for discussion;

1.)  Solutions for solving world hunger
2.)  Is Elvis still alive and if so where is he. (I have a theory or two on this one)
3.)  NSYNC or the Backstreet Boys, which group is more GAY
4.)  Is Britney Spears really Madonna's love child

Paul
