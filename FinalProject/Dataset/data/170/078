Kalen,. per your discussion about getting these issues to management committee,  below are some of the HR Policy changes to consider implementing prior to year end.
Clarification - what revisions, if any, should apply to the non-filed entities? 

Vacation - change the accrual rate, as planned
FMLA / Sick Leave - FMLA leave to run concurrent with Enron's sick leave program when appropriate.  
Educational Assistance: suspend tuition reimbursements. 
Leave of absence - reduce or amend paid leave.
	Leaves include:
		Personal leave (eliminate Mgmt. discretion)
		Funeral /bereavement leave  (should we establish a policy cap of 3 days) 
		Paternity / adoption / pay to parent / father - (40 hours paid outside of Enron sick leave)
		Jury - Witness duty - (pay to the extent required by law) 
		Military leave - (reduce or eliminate the salary bridge paid- difference between Enron base and military pay)
