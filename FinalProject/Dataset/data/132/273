Dear Paul,

As I mentioned during our earlier discussions one of the projects that Enron has been working on is a potential power plant/site in Deerfield, FL.  There are alot of unknowns on whether this project in the current environment with respect to energy development in Florida and Enron in particular will go forward.  We will probably know more toward the end of the year. 

As part of the process, if it goes forward, we will be a need to obtain a Water Agreement.  I believe there may have been some preliminary discussions months ago with the County concerning water requirements but nothing has occurred recently. At this time our folks do not want to talk with County about it for some reason. 

However, assuming that we might need a water agreement at sometime and probably on short notice, I decided at least to prepare a draft and thus be in position to talk with the County when and if the discussions ever to proceed.  The commercial provisions are not finalized yet but the draft contains what I think our folks may need.  

I would appreciate your reviewing this draft and providing me your thoughts and any suggested changes.  I will call you next week to discuss this in more detail.  From a strategy standpoint we are not in position at this time to talk with the County or to let them know we may be preparing a draft.

Have a great weekend.

Thanks for your help.

Randy
