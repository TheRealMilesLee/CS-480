Here are revised headcount allocation numbers from what I left you( same number of people in total with better descriptions of responsibilities and more precise allocations)...also attached is outside services detail( reduced by $700,000 since our discussions earlier) with business unit allocations reflected. The overall budget based on these attachments, which would reflect the $ 700,000 outside services reduction and three additional people severed( all assistants) would come to $13,200,000. I would allocate as follows: EES:$5.9 million; Enron Americas:$6.8 million; and global assets picking up $500,000. Let's talk Monday.
