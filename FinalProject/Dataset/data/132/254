Assembly Member Tim Leslie is interested in sponsoring a bill which would
grant air credits to prospective power plant owners in exchange for using
reclaimed water.  The bill is in its infancy and none of the details have
been worked out.  His office would like to know if Enron would be interested
in providing technical assistance with the measure.  They approached Enron
because of the Roseville plant, recognizing that Roseville already has its
air credits and is already scheduled to use reclaimed water.

Thoughts?
