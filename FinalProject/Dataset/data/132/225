The attached document titled "Retention-EGS"  is the list of essential employees that Stan Horton has approved for inclusion in a retention program.  

The document titled "Divest" includes EGS employees that currently have retention or divestiture agreements in place and are not in need of additonal consideration.  I understand that there are additional PGE employees with agreements that I have not listed and that you have access to those names.

Additional names of EGS/International employees will be coming from Scott Gilchrist after he gets with Jim Hughes this afternoon.
