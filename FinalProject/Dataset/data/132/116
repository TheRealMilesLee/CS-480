Do we want to tighten these up somewhat?

  24            HR Analyst      $1,000          $0              Consistent with all non-managerial levels

Lisa, 

Attached is the Spend/Approvals amounts for the new HR job groups that have recently been created and the most recent HR structure file that I received from Lessa Hutcherson in HR.  I inserted in red the Spend/Approval amounts that we discussed for the new groups.  Currently we have no employees in any of these new groups.

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks 

Jeff
