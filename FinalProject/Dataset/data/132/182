Topic:          The Indus Connection: East Meets West In Silicon Valley
Speakers:       Dr. Kailash Joshi, President, TiE World-wide; Vani Kola, 
CEO & Founder, NthOrbit; Kumar Malavalli, Co-Founder & VP Technology, 
Brocade; Moderated by Gurmeet Naroola, Author, The Entrepreneurial Connection.

Silicon Vallley's rapid growth and vibrant development has benefited 
significantly from new entrants from all over the world.  Over 30% of new 
ventures in the Valley since 1980 have been founded by Indian and Chinese 
emigrants.  Unusually open and meritocratic, the Valley's strong network 
-based culture has provided a home for many bright young engineers seeking 
to establish themselves in the United States.  Natural risk takers, having 
already chosen to emigrate to the U.S., they often opt to found their own 
companies if careers in big firms do not prove rewarding.  Mutual support 
and networking groups of all kinds enhanced the ability of these new 
entrants to succeed- and succeed they did!  On November 29, we are happy to 
host a panel of entrepreneurs who exemplify this important phenomenon.
