Hi -
 
I would contact the other finance guys here. Who knows, they may have
some great leads. As far as the letter is concerned, I would be happy to
do it. Generally, however, each grad school has a specific
recommendation form that they want references to fill out. So let me
know after you get the required info from the schools. Typically,
students just send it to me as I will probably have to submit it
directly to the grad school people as they generally want confidential
letters.
 
Jim

	Jim,
	 
	I did write to Eric Hughson about the PhD program and I am
waiting for his response.
	In the meantime can you write me a recommendation letter. I know
you don't like to do this but if you would it would be great. I am
planning to apply to about 3-4 schools for now. I will mail the
paperwork to you on Monday.
	Also, should I contact the other finance professors at OSU
trying to see what they can help me with?
	Thanks for all your help. I will keep you posted.
	 
	Monika

		Hi Again Monika -
		 
		Here is what I heard from my former professor. If I were
you, I would contact Eric Hughson about CU's PhD program in Finance. It
is worth a try.
		 
		I will contact you if I hear about other opportunities
either for graduate study or employment opportunities. Keep me posted.

		Hi Jim,
		It has been a long time between communications.  We no
longer offer an MS in Finance (however, I believe the Denver Campus
does).  We admit only one or two new students in the Finance PhD Program
each year--thus it is very competitive.  Our Finance PhD Program
coordinator is Eric Hughson and he could be contacted at
Eric.Hughson@Colorado.EDU.  Unfortunately, I don't have any specific
recommendations.
		Ron
		PS--I also still like the teaching part of the academic
life and probably won't be retiring for another few years.

			Hi Ron - 

			It certainly has been a long time since we have
communicated. I am glad to see that you have not yet retired and either
have I. Moreover, I don't have any plans to do so in the immediate
future as this job is so much fun.

			The reason I am writing is that a former student
of mine from Albania who works for Enron has been thinking for some time
that she would like to go back to school and get a Master's Degree in
Finance or PhD. Being a foreign student she needs to get some sort of
scholarship or assistantship. She graduated from OSU a year or so ago
and has been working at Enron since that time. Given what is happening
at Enron, I am not surprised that she has decided to go back for a
graduate degree.

			Our College of Business does not have any
graduate student assistantships and we also don't offer a master degree
in finance or PhD.  Monika is without a doubt one of the sharpest
students I have had in recent years. She is incredibly bright and works
very hard. 

			Does CU still offer the masters degree in
finance and still offer student assistantships. If I recall, George
Carvel was working on a MS in Finance and had an assistantship under
Maurice Unger when I was going to CU. If so, can I give Monika your name
and have her contact and perhaps forward her resume to you. Or can you
put her in touch with the right person at CU?

			If CU does not have anything available do you
know of a few schools who might so that I can pass the information on to
Monika?

			Thanks for any help you can provide. 

			Best regards, 

			Jim
