Dear Friend,

I am Barrister Festus Ibe, the Personal Attorney
to a Foreign Contractor, who worked with a
Multinational Oil Firm in Nigeria.
On the 11th of September 2001, my client, a Mexican
National, late Engineer Carlos Montoya, an oil
Merchant / Contractor with the Federal Government of
Nigeria, until his death Three years ago in a ghastly
terrorist attack to American Airlines Flight 11, from
Boston, Massachusetts, to Los Angeles, California,
crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Centre
with 86 people on board. All occupants of the
Aeroplane unfortunately lost their lives.

Since then I have made several inquiries to Several
Embassies to locate any of my clients extended
relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful.
After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided
to trace his relatives over the Internet, to locate
any member of his family but of no avail, hence I
contacted you. I have contacted you to assist me in
repatriating the money left behind by my client before
they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the
Bank where this huge deposits were lodged.
Particularly, the Bank where the deceased had an
account valued at about US$9Million has
issued me a notice to provide the next of
kin,relatives so that the fund left will be
transferred or have the account confiscated within the next twenty offici=
al
working days.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the the
relatives for over 3 years now I seek your consent to
present you as the next of kin to the deceased so that
the proceeds of this account valued at US$9Million
can be paid to you and then you and I can
share this money. 70% to me and 25% to you,while 5%
should be for expenses or tax as your Government may
require.

All I require is your honest and co-operation to
enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this
will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will
protect you from any breach of the law.
I will want you to send to me on your return email the
following information for the transfer in your favour.
1, Your full names as the Beneficiary of the Fund.
2, Your contact address
3, Your private phone and fax numbers where we will be communicating  to
each other and as soon as I received I will definitely call you.

I will want you to also send your reply to my private
email(festusibeibe12@rediffmail.com) as soon as you get this
mail to enable us discuss on the modalities and process for
success of this transaction.
I await your kind response, Good day and God bless.
Regards,

Barrister Ibe Festus.
