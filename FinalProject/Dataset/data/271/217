CANADA NEEDS MORE SKILLED IMMIGRANTS, SAYS MINISTER

29 April 2005
________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Canada's future is dependent on immigration, says Canada's Minister for Citizenship and Immigration. Joe Volpe spoke in defence of the country's new Internationally Trained Workers Initiative in a speech on 28 April. 

Volpe pointed out that Canada's birth rate is among the lowest in the western world, and its unemployment rate continues to fall. This means that Canada must recruit new immigrants to Canada. 

"Let me promise you, we will not be alone in this recruiting drive," said Volpe. "Former emigrant-generating countries, mostly in Europe, are now net immigrant receivers and seekers; their economies are every bit as vibrant as ours, with birth rates every bit as low." 

Today, he said, some 40 per cent of Canadians were born abroad or are the children of new Canadians. 

He called Canada's immigration system "a story of tremendous successes." Last year, he said, Citizenship and Immigration Canada issued some 1.1 million permits: 236,000 permanent-resident visas, and more than 800,000 other decisions for temporary workers, visitors&#146; visas, student visas, etc. About 170,000 new citizens are approved every year, joining the 18 per cent of Canadian citizens who were born elsewhere, he said. 


WHY APPLY NOW?

A common mistake is to apply for permanent residence when one needs it. A better approach is to plan ahead and apply for it when you are ELIGIBLE. Eligibility criteria are getting more stringent.

Changes which can affect your eligibility
 -  Changes in immigration policy 
 -  Changes in pass mark
 -  Changes in assessment criteria
 -  Changes in occupational demand 

You do not need to relocate immediately after your application for permanent residence is approved. Normally, you can wait for 3 years from date of approval to relocate. Furthermore, the application and approval process can take a long time, usually more than a year. 

We offer professional and efficient immigration services by providing a no-hassle, one-stop process for potential immigrants to US, UK, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia and Canada. 


We look forward to a meeting to discuss your needs.
