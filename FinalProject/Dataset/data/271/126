<p><font size="+2">"How Would You Like To Sell Your $400K/Year Practice for
$766K?"</font> 
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What would you do with a
"retirement 
  gift" of $766K?</font> Think about it for a minute. You could pay off
lingering 
  debts,<br>
  take your dream vacation, buy a new car, or even add that $766K to your
retirement 
  account. The possibilities are endless... but wouldn't you agree you'd be
better 
  off with that $766K "gift" than without it?</p>
<p>I'd like to share with you a system whereby you can sell off parts of
your 
  practice before (and as) you retire. The net result being, your practice
sells 
  for 2+ times its value! That's correct... the "pieces" are worth more
than the 
  whole!</p>
<p> Back in the 80s, Dr. Rick Kushner (Table Mountain Seminars) introduced
this 
  concept to dentists via his seminars. By<br>
  1992, he'd sold off nine partnerships including one in a practice that
didn't 
  exist yet.</p>
<p> <br>
  <strong>Rick said, "I got rich from dentistry, but I got wealthy selling
partnerships." 
  </strong></p>
<p> <br>
  But let's get back to the numbers for a minute. If you have a $400K/year
practice... 
  you can sell it for $766K (total) in the next 5-6 years. And, while
you're selling 
  partnerships in that practice, you go on earning a great income each year
just 
  like before. In fact, your practice income will "dip" very little (if at
all) 
  throughout the sales process. Now, if you presently only have a
$200K/year practice... 
  count on putting an extra $383K in your pocket in a few years. </p>
<p>But if you have a larger practice... you're in for the ride of your
life! </p>
<p>With this concept you'll lower overhead, maximize the capacity of your
facility, 
  share after-hours calls, have a way to handle "problem patients," and
become 
  wealthy in the process! </p>
<p> THE PROFITABLE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM includes a complete workbook,
template 
  contracts, two DVDs, and<br>
  an audio CD that explains everything. Don't wait another day to take
advantage 
  of this amazing opportunity.</p>
<p> THE PROFITABLE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM sells for only $297 and you can get
yours 
  by calling 1-800-337-8467 or by visiting <a
href="http://www.theprofitabledentist.com">www.theprofitabledentist.com</a> 
  and clicking on monthly specials on the home page. <br>
</p>
<p> Why wouldn't you pay $297 to learn how to gain $766K?
