 CONCERNED WITH CONTRACT AWARDS AND APPROVAL. WITH OUR

 UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$35.5M). MY COLLEAGUES AND I
 DURING THE COURSE OF OUR OFFICIAL ASSIGNMENT AWARDED
 SERIES OF CONTRACTS TO FOREIGN FIRMS ON AGREED 5%
 COMMISSION OR PROFIT ON THEIR CONTRACT SUM. HOWEVER
 THE 5% COMMISSION WHICH AMOUNTED TO US$35.5M AFTER
 AUDIT REPORT IS LEFT UNCLAIMED IN THE FLOATING ACCOUNT
 OF MY COMPANY [NNPC]. THIS CONTRACT IN QUESTION WERE

 COMPUTERS TO MY COMPANY THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL
 PETROLEUM CORPORATION [NNPC] IN 2000. THE CONTRACTORS

 RECENTLY, THE NEW CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT STARTED PAYING
 OFF ALL THE INDEBTED FOREIGN CONTRACTORS TO MY COMPANY

 ORDER TO LAUNDER A GOOD IMAGE OF THEIR GOVERNMENT
 BEFORE THE UNITED NATION. CONSEQUENT TO THIS
 DEVELOPMENT, WE CONSIDER THIS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR

 ACCOUNT OVERSEAS WHICH WE BELIEVE YOU WILL BE IN A
 POSITION TO HELP US IN TRANSFERRING THESE FUNDS
 [US$35.5M] INTO YOUR NOMINATED ACCOUNT.

 BE COMPENSATED WITH 20% OF THE REMITTED FUNDS, WHILE
 WE KEEP 75%, AND 5% WILL BE SET ASIDE TO OFFSET
 EXPENSES AND PAY THE NECESSARY TAXES. ALL MODALITIES
 OF THIS TRANSACTION HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT AND ONCE
 STARTED WILL NOT TAKE MORE THAN 10 WORKING DAYS, WITH
 YOUR FULL SUPPORT. THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE.
 
 IF THIS PROPOSAL SATISFIES YOU, PLEASE REACH US ONLY
 BY PHONE, FOR MORE INFORMATION. IT MIGHT BE
 DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH TO ME, BECAUSE OF POOR
 TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEM HERE. PLEASE KEEP TRYING, YOU
 WILL DEFINITELY GET THROUGH. IF YOU CANNOT GET THROUGH
