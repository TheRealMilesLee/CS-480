Dear Mr Motley:

I'm writing to tell you that our negotiations with the 
International Association of Machinists (IAM) District 
141M have produced a tentative agreement on a contract, 
ensuring no disruption of service to United customers.

This has been a difficult time, and I want to thank you 
for your understanding and continued support.

IAM District 141M will forward the details of the 
tentative agreement to its membership for a vote within 
the next two weeks.

This decision allows us to continue focusing on serving 
you, and I hope it renews your confidence in planning 
your travel with United. We look forward to seeing you 
on board.

Thank you,

Chris Bowers
Senior Vice President
Marketing and Sales
