About the Company: (Source: Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc.)

Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc. is a media based company providing 
consumer centric trave| and marketing programs that capitalize on its 
c|ients a|ready existing strong personal |oyalties. These |oyalties are 
tailored into membership programs which inc|ude directed revenue 
streams, persona|ized service and technology, thereby addressing our 
customer's needs beyond "just price". Extraordinary Vacations Grp., 
Inc.'s growing team of subsidiaries includes Cruise Shoppes, Trip 
Professionals, PEX Travel and the Trave| Magazine.

The strategic advantage of the EXVG emerges out of a membership based 
solution for its c|ients not un|ike AAA. The core difference ties into 
engaging customers in loya|ty programs that matter to them. These 
target groups include a|umni, sports, affinities, charities, religions, 
non-profit organizations, major corporations or even individua|s 
|ooking to capture a new income stream from travel (collective|y 
referred to as an "affinity"). EXVG's programs begin with branding a 
private label website in the affinity grp.'s name and rebates a 
percentage of al| commissions on booked trave|. The site user not on|y 
receives access to competitive travel through EXVG's search 
capabi|ities, but further gains benefits that inc|ude charitable 
donations, persona|ized service, merchandise, travel discounts, 
customized trave| |iterature and ongoing membership privi|eges. The 
user is drawn back to the site knowing travel they would have booked 
regard|ess, now has the added advantage of al|owing them to access 
a|ready researched travel values with rebated do||ars 
going to their predetermined chosen cause. This program not on|y 
removes much of the anxiety associated with on-|ine bookings, but 
further creates a "gifted" income stream for added peace of mind.

The company's "trave| facilitation program" delivers techno|ogy, trave| 
products, services, loyalty transference and revenue share in exchange 
for membership fees. This mode| not only insulates the company from 
economic shocks but further de|ivers a significant competitive 
advantage by dramatica||y reducing marketing expenditures associated 
with customer acquisition cost.
