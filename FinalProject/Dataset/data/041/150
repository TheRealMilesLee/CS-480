Hello,

Good day and Compliments,I am writing this letter in confidence believing=

that if it is the wish of God for you to help me,God almighty will bless
and reward you aboundantly and you would never regret this.

I am MR.ALIU SAIBA,the director in charge of auditing and accounting sect=
ion
of International Bank Of Africa (IBA) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Afric=
a
with due respect and regard.I have decided to contact you on a business
transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end.I came
across a very huge sum of money belonging to MR.BUD STEWART,who died on
10th of May,2001 in a Car Crash with his wife-TESSA,and his only two chil=
dren-CHUCK
and CLARK,and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank wit=
hout
any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation
before our
discovery to this development.

The said amount was US$5.2M (Five Million Two Hundred Thousand United Sta=
tes
Dollars).Honestly,after this man died with his family my Bank (iba) searc=
hed
for his next of kin to come and claim his money but they were no where to=

be found.Infact,nobody came up to claim the fund.

I in my department,have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who=

can stand in as the next of kin to the deceased and claim this money,as
well as providing Bank account for the remittance of the fund.As it may
interest you to know,I got your Contact through your Country Email Direct=
ory
on Internet.Please don't say that you did not relate to the deceased beca=
use
not relating to him makes no meaning,You must not be a blood relation bef=
ore
you become next of kin to somebody.All though i know that a transaction
of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried,but i am ass=
uring
you that all will be well at the end of the day.Meanwhile all the whole
arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to th=
e
deceased,get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign
account has been put in place and directives and needed information will
be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness
to assist me and also benefit your self to this GREAT BUSINESS OPPORTUNIT=
Y.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in
this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate
a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side durin=
g
the time of transfer because I work in this bank.This is the actual reaso=
n
why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as
the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also pres=
ent
a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into
on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by
the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitt=
ed
from to your own
designation bank account.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On
smooth conclusion of this transaction,i have agreed that 40% of the money=

will be for you for your assistance and 60% will be for me.Any expenses
that may likely to arise during the time of transfer of this fund into yo=
ur
account- we will paid it together.So,if you are Capable to handle this Tr=
ansaction,indicate
your interest by replying this letter with a PROMISE that you won't BETRA=
Y
me when the fund arrives your account.Once I receive your urgent reply,I
will send you more DETAILS and TEXT OF APPLICATION which your will fill
with your personal datas and submit to my Bank as the real next of kin to=

MR.BUD STEWART. 

I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you conf=
irm
the Fund in your account successfully,and ask me to come down to your cou=
ntry
for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously in=
dicated
and further investment,either in your country or any country you may even=

advice.

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL ME ON 00226-76-55-61-45 FOR MORE CLARIFICATIONS
ON THIS ISSUES!!!

Thanks for your anticipated assistance.

Yours faithfully,

MR.ALIU SAIBA.
