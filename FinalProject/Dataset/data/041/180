ANALYSIS =0D=0AIn the beginning of the year, we expected sufficient =
support between .50 and the 2004 low of .58. There was not, =
and the stock quickly dropped and became oversold.  We then =
upgraded TNXT from an accumulate to a buy under .38=0D=0A=0D=0AThere =

targets.  =0D=0A=0D=0A  =0D=0A=0D=0ABOTTOM LINE =0D=0A=0D=0AThere =
is growing interest in communicating with consumers outside =
the home because advertisers are losing control of the living =
room.  It is reasonable to assume that should TNX Television =
meet its milestones, its stock is likely to handsomely reward =
share holders with far above average stock market returns.  =
Once this stock becomes =E2=80=9Cdiscovered=E2=80=9D, then $1 =
will become the floor and not a ceiling. We conservatively project =
potential 2005 and 2006 targets of $1.50 and $3+ respectively. =
We first recommended an initial accumulation under $.78. When =
the market opportunity presented itself, we added buys under =
