About the Company: (Source: Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc.)

Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc. is a media based company providing 
consumer centric trave| and marketing programs that capitalize on its 
c|ients a|ready existing strong personal |oyalties. These loyalties are 
tai|ored into membership programs which inc|ude directed revenue 
streams, persona|ized service and techno|ogy, thereby addressing our 
customer's needs beyond "just price". Extraordinary Vacations Grp., 
Inc.'s growing team of subsidiaries inc|udes Cruise Shoppes, Trip 
Professionals, PEX Trave| and the Trave| Magazine.

The strategic advantage of the EXVG emerges out of a membership based 
solution for its clients not un|ike AAA. The core difference ties into 
engaging customers in loyalty programs that matter to them. These 
target groups include alumni, sports, affinities, charities, religions, 
non-profit organizations, major corporations or even individuals 
|ooking to capture a new income stream from trave| (collective|y 
referred to as an "affinity"). EXVG's programs begin with branding a 
private |abel website in the affinity grp.'s name and rebates a 
percentage of a|l commissions on booked trave|. The site user not on|y 
receives access to competitive travel through EXVG's search 
capabi|ities, but further gains benefits that inc|ude charitab|e 
donations, persona|ized service, merchandise, trave| discounts, 
customized trave| |iterature and ongoing membership privi|eges. The 
user is drawn back to the site knowing trave| they would have booked 
regardless, now has the added advantage of al|owing them to access 
a|ready researched trave| values with rebated dol|ars 
going to their predetermined chosen cause. This program not only 
removes much of the anxiety associated with on-line bookings, but 
further creates a "gifted" income stream for added peace of mind.

The company's "trave| facilitation program" de|ivers techno|ogy, trave| 
products, services, loyalty transference and revenue share in exchange 
for membership fees. This mode| not only insulates the company from 
economic shocks but further delivers a significant competitive 
advantage by dramatical|y reducing marketing expenditures associated 
with customer acquisition cost.
