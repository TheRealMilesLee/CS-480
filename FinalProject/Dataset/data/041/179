Governor Jim Geringer of Wyoming is in the process of organizing a meeting between himself, 3-4 other western governors, and FERC Commissioner Pat Wood to discuss wholesale electricity issues facing the Western Power Market.  This meeting is expected to take place in the next couple of weeks. 
 
In preparation of the meeting, Governor Geringer has requested information on the following issues which I would like each of you to provide me by next Tuesday, September 4th.

A summary of Enron's position on the FERC RTO Model and the necessary components of a well-designed RTO - Steve Walton 
A summary of FERC's Price Cap Order and the implications it has had on the West - Alan Comnes 
An update of the Refund proceedings and next steps - Bob Frank 
Summary of FERC's failure to go after California for failure to comply with FERC - Sue Mara 
Update of CALISO issues - Sue Mara
