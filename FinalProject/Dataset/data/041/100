The Assembly Appropriations Committee canceled the SBX2 78 hearing mid-way
through the presentation by Senator Polanco.  As Hedy indicated before, with
the Republicans not willing to vote for the bill, liberal Democrats crafted
11 new amendments which they felt were necessary in order to garner their
votes.  Clearly there was no consensus among committee members or leadership
on the amendments in question and the business community was up in arms.
Amid the confusion, Hertzberg effectively ordered the hearing canceled.
They intend to hear the bill again on Monday.
