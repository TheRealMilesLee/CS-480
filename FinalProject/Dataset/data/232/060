To Friends and Neighbors,

Bernice Dansby called me last night to point out a
correction/clarification of the information in the EMCA newsletter that
we provided on the upcoming primary elections.  First, the early voting
on February 23rd will be held at the Multi-Purpose Center on West Gray,
just west of Waugh.  The regular Democratic voting location will be at
Wharton Elementary School on March 12, however, she has not heard where
the Republican primary will be held.  She told me that sometimes they
are held in separate rooms at the school, but sometimes are in different
locations.  So please watch the newspaper for voting locations to ensure
that you go to the correct location for your Party's primary.

Cheryl Hastings
