I've asked Emily to set up a meeting on Thur. or Fri. this week to push forward the discussion we started at Stan's half day staff meeting last week on employee allocation to Dynegy.  Please complete, as best you can, the org. chart for your groups that Stan originally asked for and bring them to this meeting for discussion by the group (my recollection is that we were all asked to come up with a list of the people we needed to run our groups assuming NNG doesn't come back, along with a budget based on that headcount).  The people you don't use for your proposed organizations are the ones that will go to Dynegy under this approach.   At this meeting, we will discuss our org. charts and try to come up with a consensus proposal that we'd ask Stan to sign off on and that we'd then propose to Dynegy.  I understand that there are some unresolved issues on how to do this (Phil's question about how many officers his new group should have, for example) but we need to sort it out as best we can and then run it by Stan.
