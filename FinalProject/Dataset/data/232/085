I am working on procuring data from Amerex - gas and power.  They have agreed to release data back to 11/30 and provide closing sheets on a go forward basis.  We will need to pay them the following:

$350 per month x (December/January/February) + pre-pay for 1 month (March) =

$350 x 4 =   $1400

Contact name is Mike Prokoff
281-340-5290

Any help with getting a check cut would be appreciated.

Thanks,
RH

I'd like to package the gas needs with the power needs for broker data.  Let's discuss on Tuesday where you're leaning for power.

Thanks
