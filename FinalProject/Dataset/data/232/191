OFFICE OF THE AUDITOR,
FINANCIAL BANK 
LOT-201, RUE AMBASSAD,
COTONOU, 
REPUBLIQUE DU BENIN.
 
Dear Sir/Madam,
 
       l am the Auditor in charge of the Foreign Remittance Department of the =
above named Bank here in Cotonou capital of Benin Republic in West Africa. l =
have worked with this bank for over Ten (10) years before rising to my =
present position. Over this period of time, l have witnessed a lot of very =
interesting transactions here in the bank one of which l am about to =
introduce to you while counting on your sincerity and utmost confidence. 
    As at  May 20th 2003, one of our very prominent depositors,  Mr Wahid =
Kabar, from Saudi-Arabia and Director of a foreign oil consulting company for =
the past five years made over the years, a numbered time fixed deposits for =
twelve calender months. This is now valued at US$9.5m   (Nine and half =
million US Dollars only)  in my branch of the bank. 
    Upon maturity of this deposit on the 19th  March 2004, l ordered my =
credit officer to send a routine notification to his forwarding address. =
Unfortunately, we got no reply. After a month, we sent another reminder =
letter and finally discovered from his emplyees that  Mr. Wahid Kabar  was =
one of the passengers who died in the ill-fated plane crash involving a =
boeing 727 UTA chattered flight which took off from Cotonou in Benin Republic =
and crashed into the ocean on thursday 25th December 2003. 
 For further details and verification of the plane crash, please visit:
 http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash
   lnvestigations and all attempts to trace and locate his next-of-kin proved =
abortive. l made further investigations because l knew him personally and =
discovered that  Mr. Wahid Kabar  did not declare any kin or relations in his =
official documents including his bank deposit paper work in my bank as this =
is not obligatory to run such an account. Moreover, he has made such deposits =
many times in the past without complications. This money now sits clean in my =
bank and no one will ever come for it. According to banking laws and codes =
here in Benin Republic, at the expiration of two years, such money must be =
sent to the ministry of finance and deposited in the government's account as =
unclaimed. Consequently, here is my proposal:- l would like you as a =
foreigner to stand-in as  the  next-of-kin to  Mr. Wahid Kabar.  This is very =
simple, risk-free and quick. l want you to send the following information =
immediately to my mail-box. (mallamyaro@zwallet.com)  to enable me start the =
bank paper-work:
 
(1). Your full Names and address as the next-of-kin.  (Beneficiary).
(2). Direct telephone and fax numbers.   
(3). Gender/Sex and marital status.
(4). Nationality and Date of birth.
(5). Occupation and position.
 
   l will be here to follow it up and make other concerned bank officials  =
co-operate with me as they will be adequately compensated. The money will =
then be transfered electronically to your norminated account anywhere in the =
world outside Africa for us to share as follows: 
(A) We shall set aside 40% for the bank officials.
(B) You will receive  30% of the  sum total and 
(C)  l will have the remaining 30% for  myself.
However, should you have reservations over the above allocated percentages, =
we are ready to negotiate  further as l will not want us to miss this golden =
opportunity to make real money.
Due to my position in the bank, l am always very busy and can hardly travel =
out of cotonou due to my work-load.  We have therefore decided that you =
contact our  ATTONEY who has an office in Spain so that he will prepare all =
the LEGAL documents we need that will put you in place as the next-of-kin and =
rightful beneficiary of the funds. He knows all about this business and has =
been a good friend. He has also helped us in similar deals in the past. My =
friend, this is no child's- play. lt is serious business and you will be =
surprised how people make money.  Here is his  his contact below:
MR. ROBERTO ABBAS
TEL: 0034-646-272-296 (call from 10.00am to 6.00pm)
E-MAIL- robertoabbas@yahoo.com
l advise that you contact him immediately to  provide you with all the =
details, proceedure and relevant  information you will need to effect the =
successful transaction of this business.  l like to assure you again that =
this transaction is totally risk-free because we are making this deal   with =
people in the highest authorities of government and we in the bank will make =
this deal  very legitimate  as we will prepare all the neccessary papers to =
cover the transaction. l like to advise and solicit your utmost sincerity and =
confidence as we will have more other transactions to carry out together in =
the future. l will personally use my position and influence in the bank to =
make sure that the money gets to your foreign account within five working =
days. Once again, l like to stress that you must be sincere with us in the =
sharing process. This is very important. 
    Awaiting your urgent reply,
    Best Regards.
    Usman Yaro.
