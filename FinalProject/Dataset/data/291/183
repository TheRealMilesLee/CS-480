MR. WANG QIN
HANG SENG BANK LTD.
DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,
CENTRAL HONG KONG,
HONK KONG.
 
 
Dear Sir,
Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the 
Hang
Seng Bank Ltd. 
 
I have a concealed business suggestion for you. Before the U.S/Iraqi war our 
client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also a 
businessman made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value 
of Twenty Millions, Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my 
branch in september2002. Upon maturity several
notices were sent to him without a response. We later found out that the 
General and his family had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit 
their home.
After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa 
did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper 
work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at 
my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty 
Million,  Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank 
and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that 
according to the laws of my country at the expiration of 3 years the funds 
will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to 
claim the funds.  Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will 
like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so 
that you will be able to receive his funds. 
 
WHAT IS TO BE DONE?
I want you to know that I have everything planned out so that we shall come 
out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary 
document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa, all 
that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your 
Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you 
have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also file for claims on your 
behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor 
for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.
There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a 
legal method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please 
endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. 
Please remember to respond to my private email 
wang10ng@yahoo.com.hk
 
Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall 
share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred 
during the course of this transaction. Should you be interested please send me 
your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide 
you with more details of this transaction.
Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.
Kind Regards
Mr. Wang  Qin
Note all responds should be in my private email box 
wang10ng@yahoo.com.hk
