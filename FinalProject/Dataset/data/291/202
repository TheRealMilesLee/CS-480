From: Mrs. Sophia Dobet

Dear Sir,

PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE GLORY OF LORD.

My name is Mrs. Sophia Dobet nationality of Cote D'lvoire. I am married to Mr
Egbert Dobet who worked with Cote D'lvoire Embassy in Spain for thirteen years
before he died in terrorist attack carried out in American Trade Center on
September 11th, 2001. May God receive his Soul in perfect peace, while asking
the Lord to forgive those who perpetrated such evil act on that day.

We married for eleven years without a child. Before his death we were both born
again Christians. When my late husband was alive, we deposited the sum of
US$7.2Million (Seven Million Two Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with one of the
good Finance/Security Companies in Madrid, Spain. Presently, this money is
still with this Finance/Security Company.

Recently, my Doctor told me that i would not last for the next three months due
to cancer problem, though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my
condition, i decided to donate this fund to charity through a God fearing
individual that will utilize this money the way i am going to instruct here in.
I want such a person who will use this fund to Churches, Orphanages, Research
Centres and Widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that God's desire
is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that
giveth.

I took this decision because i don't have any child that will inherit this money
and my husband's relatives are not Christians and i don't want my family hard
earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this
money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence my reason for taking this bold
decision. I am not afraid of death since i know where i am going. I know that i
am going to be in the bosom of the Lord; Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the Lord will
fight my case and i shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone
communication in this regard because of the presence of my family relatives
around me always and considering my condition of health. I don't want them to
know about this development. With God all things are possible.

As soon as i receive your positive reply which will include your private phone
and fax numbers enabling me forward them to the Finance/Security Company for
immediate transfer in your name, i shall give you the name and contact details
of the Finance/Security Company. I will also issue you a Letter of Authority
that will empower you as the new beneficiary of this fund. I want you and your
place of worship to always pray for me because the Lord is my shepherd. My
happiness is that i lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to
serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful
all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing
for another God fearing individual for this same purpose.

I repeat, please assure me that you will act accordingly as i stated herein
during your reply, and you should send me your full name, bank account
information and your private telephone and fax numbers, so that i can forward
them to the Finance/Security Company immediately for the process.

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.
Yours in Lord,
Mrs. Sophia Dobet
