Briton who took trading online

   ENRON'S fastest-rising star was a British mother-of-two. Anonymous
in the UK, Louise Kitchen, the 32-year-old former Powergen manager,
made her name with the audacious manner in which she set up the power
company's online trading arm, writes Rupert Steiner. It paid off and
her story is used as a case study in management schools throughout
America.

   In just seven months, Kitchen, president and chief operating
officer of EnronOnline, enabled the web-based trading of natural gas
in North America after developing the idea and progressing it to days
before launch without seeking board approval.
   She joined the company in London in the spring of 1994 and was
responsible for building its natural gas trading business in Europe.

   A self-confessed loudmouth, she established a reputation for being
larger than life. She is certainly no shrinking violet - her
colleagues describe her as blunt, pushy and inspiring.

   Her career took off one April morning in 1999. She was in a taxi
on her way to Heathrow airport, bound for a large gas-processing
plant in Teesside.

   John Sherriff, managing director of Enron Europe, and Greg
Whalley, Enron's chief gas trader in Houston, called and asked if she
would prepare some research on trading gas contracts online.

   She spotted the opportunity and set out to do more than just
review Enron's options for online trading. She enlisted the support
of Enron's sceptical top traders and scoured the company for software
developers and other experts.

   Her volunteers worked nights and weekends while carrying on with
their regular jobs. Kitchen did not attempt to get corporate approval
or seek permission to change the way the company traded, she simply
presented the project as a fait accompli a few weeks before it went
live.

   It was a huge risk but one which was credited with the remaking of
the company. By mid-summer 2000 it had revolutionised the energy-
trading business, notching up more than $1 billion in average daily
trading transactions and lifting Enron's sales by 75% in the second
quarter. It raised Enron's market value by billions of dollars.

   She has been promoted seven times in five years and is listed in
Fortune league table of the world's most powerful women. Her future
now looks uncertain.
