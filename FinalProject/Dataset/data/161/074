Send to your group's please.  


If you feel like drowning your sorrows at the end of the world in some free keg beer, sodas and hard liquor - come down to Clear Lake and celebrate the fact that today may be the last paycheck you receive from Enron.  Playstation, pool, and darts(with pictures of great Enron leaders) will be available for your enjoyment.  You can also try chase the 3 year old with the dirty diaper.  Party starts about 7 ish.  We will order Pizza or something like that if you haven't eaten.  Directions:
I - 45 South to exit 29 - CLC Blvd.
Turn left under the freeway - heading east
You will travel roughly four miles (through 3 lights and two stop signs) turn left on Noble Pine(across from Children's World) 
When that street dead end's take a right on Towering Oak
Take first left onto Cherry Oak
That dead end's at Sterling Wood Way - take a left.
Third house of the right 4435 Sterling Wood Way
281-486-7026

Hope to see everyone there.
