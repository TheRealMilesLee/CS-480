Tony + Kim,

Several of the rejoining partners of ANNGTC have contacted me asking if Enron is interested in selling its residual claims.  The answer is most definitely affirmative.  Please advise on the following-

What are the bankruptcy court's requirements to undertake a mandated auction?
Is it possible through the bankruptcy court to extinguish liability claims arising prior to NAGC's withdrawal from the ANNGTC partnership?  If so, how?

Here's how I would like to proceed-
Prepare an offering letter that identifies what we are selling and preferred terms + conditions
Distribute to each partner, possibly other interested parties (ANS producers)
Obtain bids and evaluate best offer

I would like to begin the sales process asap and would appreciate your feedback most urgently.
