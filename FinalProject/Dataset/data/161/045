	This is an unfiled claim by Franklin Adkins, a small gas producer in the Appalachians, for recovery of approximately $336,832.17 for the alleged breach of a gas purchase agreement.  By letter dated December 3, Michael Farrell of Farrell, Farrell & Farrell, L.C., Adkins's attorney, requested that Adkins' named be included in the list of creditors and that a proof of claim be forwarded to Mr. Adkins in accordance with the Court's Scheduling Order.

	Do you need a copy of the letter?  Do I need to make any response?

	Many thanks.

	Britt
