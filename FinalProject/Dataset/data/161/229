Ken, 
    I realize that times are tough, but this is really twisting the knife that is already deeply embedded in the majority of employees.  Have you ever gone down to the Body Shop in the mornings or at noon to see how many employees use the facility for health and stress relief purposes?  We've done a lot of things during the past few weeks to kill morale, but this is a new low.  Are you going to do anything about it?  I think that a lot of people would like to know.

Dan

The Body Shop will close today (December 6, 2001) at 7:30 p.m. and will remain closed indefinitely due to the current business circumstance.  

Access to the Body Shop will be available from Friday, December 7 through Friday, December 14, during the hours of 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. for members to clean out their lockers.  

Thank you.
