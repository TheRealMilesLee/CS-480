Hi Ron!
 
I have two additional references you can feel free to contact prior to our meeting: Deborah MacDonald and Bill Allison. Both Deb and Bill hold Presidential positions at Kinder Morgan Energy. Further, Deb, Bill, Steve Kean and I all worked at Enron together at various times since 1990.  Additionally, Deb and Bill have had past communications with John Freud in your office.
 
 Please feel free to call Deb at 713-369-9240 and Bill at 713-369-9444.
 
Thank you!  I look forward to meeting you Monday!
 
Best regards!
 
~~Christie.
