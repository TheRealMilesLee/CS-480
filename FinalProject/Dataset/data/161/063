Steve,  

Here is the cost structure for calling cards vs. 1-800's.  We have submitted a request to Worldcom to have all calling cards turned off for severed employees.  We are awaiting a reply from Worldcom as to when they will have the access shutdown.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.  

Thanks.  JR
