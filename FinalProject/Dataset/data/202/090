The report:
- Describes what superconductors are and how they work
- Identifies the power industry conditions that are driving the development 
of superconductor technology 
- Explains the superconducting applications that are relevant to the energy 
industry 
- Details the government-sponsored programs that are driving superconductor 
R&D 
- Highlights the industry organizations that support superconductor technology 

- Reveals the industry initiatives currently applying superconductors to 
electric power 
- Profiles key companies and national labs involved in superconducting
