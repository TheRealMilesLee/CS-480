All:

I said I would keep you in the loop on cost with these publications.  Please review the PIRA cost structure and let me know if you will be interested and the amount of users for this publication.  Note price increases for each site.

Thanks,

Danielle

Dear Danielle,

It was a pleasure talking with you today.  PIRA would be delighted to
restart the relationship it has had with Enron over the course of the last
decade.  As a first step, I have attached an excel file presenting PIRA's
site license pricing matrix, which provides the fees for PIRA's Retainer
Services (oil, gas, electricity), based on different levels of usage.

I have also attached a document listing all of our energy service offerings
and studies, along with the corresponding fees, for you to review.

Please contact me if you have any questions.  I look forward to talking with
you further.

Regards,

Jeff Steele
Manager, Business Development
