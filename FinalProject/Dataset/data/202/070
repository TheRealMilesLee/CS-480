Kinder Morgan Moving Ahead with Advantage Pipeline

 

Gas Daily reports that Kinder Morgan is planning to go ahead with its
previously announced Advantage Pipeline, which would connect the
Cheyenne Hub with points in Eastern Kansas.  KM would also expand its 8
bcf storage Huntsman storage facility near Cheyenne Hub to about 14 bcf.
Advantage would be built with an initial capacity of 330 mmcfd and could
be expanded to 450 per day as coalbed methane production in Wyoming
increased.  The pipe is planned to be operational by late 2004.

Westchester County, NY Battles Millennium Pipeline

  

Westchester County, north of New York City, will petition the 

FERC to reconsider its decision to permit Columbia Gas to build the 

530-mile Millennium pipeline from Ontario to Mount Vernon, NY. The 

pipeline would transport 700,000 Mcf per day to New York City and 

southern parts of the state. The county alleges that the FERC 

prematurely granted Columbia's request to build the pipeline. They 

say that Columbia does not have the needed state approvals to proceed 

with construction and that the company did not provide crucial 

information about using dynamite to blast in environmentally 

sensitive areas in the Hudson River. A FERC study found that the 

pipeline would have limited adverse environmental impact and was the 

preferred alternative to deliver natural gas to New York. The 

commission has 30 days to respond to the county's petition. If 

denied, Westchester can then seek a court order to block 

construction. The county has asked several state regulatory 

departments to deny future approvals and cancel existing permits 

already granted. Westchester will also refuse to grant Columbia 

permits for construction on county land. Additionally, the county is 

questioning whether the pipeline violates a state plan to protect 

coastal areas from environmental damage. Federal law prohibits a 

federal agency from granting approval for projects that affect the 

coastline if a state finds it violates its own coastal plan. In 

addition, county officials have asked the governor to intervene when 

he attends a FERC conference later this month.

 

Canadian Drilling to Drop this Year 

 

The Petroleum Services Association of Canada says that Western 

Canadian producers expect to cut drilling by 26% this year and 

natural gas will continue to dominate exploration activity. It 

predicts 13,386 wells will be drilled in western Canada, down from 

last year's record 18,024. Natural gas will account for 8,189, or 

61%, of its forecast well completions this year. PSAC expects 10,309 

wells to be drilled in Alberta, down 26% from 2001; 2,323 wells in 

Saskatchewan, a 25% drop; and 674 in northeastern British Columbia, 

down 29%. There were 11,177 natural gas completions last year in the 

Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, with another 26 natural gas wells 

drilled in the East Coast offshore.
