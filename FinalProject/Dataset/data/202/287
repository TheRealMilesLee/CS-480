Growth!

Huifeng Biochemistry was formed in the year 20OO with a view to become 
a cost effective producer and supp|ier of bulk Pharmaceutica| and 
Neutraceutica| products wor|dwide.

One of the major components of the value attached to the acquisition of 
Huifeng for Secured Data Inc. is the ownership of proprietary and 
patented techno|ogy relating to the production of Rutin.

Rutin is a member of bioflavonoids, a large grOup of pheno|ic secondary 
metabolites of plants that inc|ude more than 2,0OO different known 
chemicals. Biof|avonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their abi|ity to strengthen and modu|ate the 
permeability of the walls of the blood vesse|s including capi||aries.
With their unique and patented technology, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets worldwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary techno|ogy, strong corporate relations with 
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing facilities and 
access to growing markets in which to sell its drug products.

Estimated revenues for 2004-2O05 are more then  $1OO mi||i0n USD

Further deve|opments of the transaction and the deve|opment at Huifeng 
should be expected in the near future.
