Currently, we are researching ways to enhance our Internet services to you and making our FERC
archives searchable and would like your feedback  Would this service be of interest to you and what  features or functions would best serve you? 

After our previous e-mail we had several questions concerning upgrading to the new Real One player. 

  1.  Do you have to upgrade to the new Real One player to view FERC our programming? 

  No, you can still use Real Player. We suggested that you upgrade because of the new features Real   One offers making it easier to view the agenda while playing the archive.  When using a previous  version of Real you just have to go back and forth between the two windows (browser & player) to see the agenda.    The new player just makes it easier and more convenient for you to view the agenda and video in one window. 

  2.  When I go to download the Real One they want my credit card number.  How do I get the Free
  Real One Player? 

Unfortunately, Real does not make finding the Real One Free player easy.  When you go to the web page (www.real.com <http://www.real.com/>) go about half way down and on a gray bar going across the page you will see  "Our Free Player", click that link and you will be taken to another page.  On the new page look in the lower right hand corner toward the bottom of page and you will see a link "Download the Free RealOne Player Only".  You will then need to fill out their paperwork (choose the option that you are a new user) and register but will not be charged. 

As always, if you have any questions or need help downloading or installing the Real Player, please contact our office at 703-993-3100 or capcon@gmu.edu. 

  Thank you
