Mr. McMichael-

I am requesting that we reconvene a meeting as soon as possible to discuss the Dominion Transmission issues. I am getting phone calls, faxes, and e-mails almost daily from affected producers. We need to reach consensus on handling these urgent requests.

Several of our (former) producers are being required by Dominion to provide a signoff from Enron North America concerning our termination of their contracts and/or the release of the producers' gas back to the producer so that the producer can sell it elsewhere.  They are under a deadline to get these termination letters forwarded to Dominion immediately or their gas will remain unallocated and they will not get paid for January 2002 gas in March 2002 (as is normal).  

Producers currently requesting such termination letters include:
Pentex Energy Inc
Pacific Atlantics Resources
Gas Marketing Inc
Megan Oil & Gas
Triad Energy of West Virginia
Virco, Inc

In addition, the following producers are also requesting termination documents via an e-mail from potential buyer
Viking Resources
Perkins Oil & Gas

We need to determine the proper pathing of such requests including receipt, evaluation, termination, signoff, and return of such documents, and to be able to handle them in as timely a fashion as possible.

Thank you for your attention annd assistance.

Wade Price
