Whats up.... or down for the matter of fact :]. Anyways Hi, I am Julie. My birthday was not to long ago. I turned 18. I am a senior high school student. I love animals and cute bunnys, but most of all I love getting off on my new webcam :D. I am so excited, its free, its live stream and I am usually on only 5 days a week 24 hours a day. No silly memberships, verify your age and you can be watching me right now. Well, I do this for you, I am not a slut!... I just love getting off, and interweb gives me this ability to do what ever I want and as much as I want untill we are both pleased :D. See you soon hun. Luv Julz.
