Think you'll know by next week?  Otherwise, we may assign you the 
Parisian equivalent of lagniappe...just in case you don't make it!

Folks -

The time of our next gathering is rapidly approaching.  On the evening 
of
Saturday, March 23, we will meet at Tom & Jerilynn Daugherty's home in
Pearland (time and directions will be forthcoming).  Kim Watson will be
making the menu assignments for our French-themed soiree.

We need to know who is planning to attend so that the assignments can be
properly made (and confirmed).  Please reply to this message by Tuesday,
March 5, at 5 p.m., or leave a message at my office at (281) 440-5300 
x222
with your plans to attend (or with your regrets).  If you can make it, 
tell
me who and how many you will be, and if you have any course preference 
for
your assignment.

Our last evening out at Mark's American was fantastic, and we are all
looking forward to returning to the in-home dining of our origins.  We 
hope
to see you there.

John
