Sara,

Here is a list of new deals since December 03, 2001.  There are several deals listed as "pending bankruptcy," but were put there by our group due to the bankruptcy itself.  These deals do not have any generated confirmations, but can be done very quickly if you would like.  Please let me know what you would like me to do.


Thanks,

Patrick
