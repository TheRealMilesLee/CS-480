The following items were discussed in this weeks corporate change control...

Feb 27
From 5:00 - 6:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will block all ICMP messages from all Internet routers.  These changes will be made on the Houston, Ardmore EIN, and Omaha Internet routers.  No impact is expected.

Feb. 27
From 9:00 - 10:00 p.m., the Messaging team will upgrade Nahou-MSBES01P, Nahou-MSBES02P and Nahou-MSBES03P to SP2 and apply a hotfix.  This change will result in a five minute delay sending and receiving Blackberry messages.

Feb 28
From 7:00 p.m. through 3/1 at 1:00 a.m., the Unix team will upgrade the ftp.enron.com server from existing Ultar2 to E450 as well as upgrade ftp to Proftp ver. 1.2. This maintenance will result in a total outage of the ftp.enron.com site.  The old sites moby.enron.com and sparky.enron.com will no longer exist after this change.  Support staff should ensure jobs going to the enron ftp server use ftp.enron.com.  Any questions about this maintenance, contact me at 713-853-3381 or 713-859-6676.

Mar. 6
At 12:00 p.m., the Gas Measurement team will decommission the MIPS server (IP address 192.168.175.62).  All users and processing should be pointing to PGAS as the MIPS system is not longer being updated. The MIPS server will be powered off at this time but the equipment will not be moved until later.
