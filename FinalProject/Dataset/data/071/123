Just a quick note to let you know the team involved in this decision.  In addition to your meetings on Wednesday, our outside consultant, Ed Gillespie played a huge role with the White House, as his note below discusses.  Ed Coats in our Tax Department and Chris Long in DC did all the leg work and much more over the past year on this.  And of course, this thing is still far from a done deal...despite the President's announcement.  In the days ahead we will be calling upon many of our Houston team to help out.  So I may be calling!

linda,

there were  a lot of things that went into this, as you know, but one of the
critical factors was the early intelligence you picked up and i passed back
on the q.t.  (ain't bipartisanship grand?)  

best, ed g.
