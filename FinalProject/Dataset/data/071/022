Hi Vince,

It was good to talk to you today.  I need the following for the NDA:
Exact legal name
Corp Address
Contact (if other than you) and title 

Hopefully we can strike a mutually fruitful relationship.

Talk to you soon,
Nick


P.S.
Also, just a couple of suggestions for your web site team.
1.  Get rid of the "boing" mouseovers on the main page.That's awful!
2.  Under "Contact" it should be more than a form to email in.  Add
contact information.

Just my thoughts.  I liked your previous site (from a user-friendliness
perspective) better.
