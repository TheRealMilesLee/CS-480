I woke up in the hospital, groggy and confused. The last thing I could rec=
all was going to bed, how did I get here. I looked up and as the blurry fa=
ce came in to focus I saw my mom standing over me, holding my hand, a tear=
 running down her cheek. "Your awake!" She said almost surpirsed. "What ha=
pened" I asked barely able to speak. "Honey, you were sleep walking again,=
and you fell and hurt yourself." I tried to sit up, but couldn't move. "Oh=
,hold on" My mom said as she un-did the buckle on a restraint over my ches=
t."You were thrashing around, we had to restrain you so you would not get =
hurt." I finnaly sat up and stretched my arms. I looked over to a mirror a=
nd saw the bandages around my head. "Am I okay?" i asked worried. "Yes, yo=
u'll be fine. You need to stay here a little longer, then we can take you =
home,but we will have to do something about your sleepwalking." I shook my=
 head in agreement, but quickly stopped from the sudden pain it caused
