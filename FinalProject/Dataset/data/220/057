I love you very much sweetie. 

I'm sorry it's boring in there for you. I hope you can get out a little early today so you can get a little rest and get the things you want to do around the house done. It must be kind of sad to be there right now. How is the thing you were worried about Friday working out. Did you talk to Sean about it yet? I hope he feels the same way you do about it.

  
I love getting up with you too, scurrying around the house trying to get ready for work together and being late anyway, despite our hurry-up-ed-ness. :)

We are going got be very happy in our life together. It just feels so right. 
I was looking at the pictures of our place with somebody just a few minutes ago. I'm very excited about us in our place. I can't wait to be with you in there, entertain people and have years of fun there. 

You are the love of my life. 
I LOVE YOU. 
I'll see you soon baby. 

CV. 

P.S. 11 day to go. :)

Hi There, 

I love you, I hope you have a good day.  Work is shaping up to be a real snooze-fest. There are only 9 of us on the entire trading floor right now. Normally there used to be about 65-70 of us!

Waking up with you is so nice, I am looking forward to many years of doing just that. I think we are going to settle in just fine together. I love you and enjoy being with you so much. You are the man I have waited all these years for. Thank you for being part of my life.

I will see you this evening, a little dinner, a little laundry action, maybe a little dominoes and sheet-she-me?  Woohoo!

I love you, 

CF
