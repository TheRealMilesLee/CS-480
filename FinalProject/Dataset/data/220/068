             Label Your Way Out of Chaos

Dear Jess,

A mailing to get out the door, corporate videos to 
label and deliver, file drawers jammed so full you 
couldn't pry them open with a crowbar. 

Can you say "chaos?" 

Better to say DYMO LabelWriter EL60, the easy way to 
organize your office, and your life.  

This powerful, versatile PC printer is compatible 
with Palm(tm) Desktop. It's also a snap to use.  
Simply access the LabelWriter software through your 
Palm(tm) Desktop to choose from more than 40 
different labels for printing addresses, media, name 
tags and file folders. No more trips to the post 
office-the EL60 even prints Internet postage. You 
can also print addresses and contacts stored in 
Microsoft Word, Outlook, Goldmine, ACT! and CardScan. 

And you won't spend a cent on toner or ink cartridges 
because The EL60 uses thermal print technology.
