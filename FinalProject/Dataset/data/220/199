	FYI.  I would still like the On Call TW Scheduler to dial in at 8:00 a.m. on Saturday
	and Sunday to review status of the computer systems and any major concerns.
	If there are major concerns, we will probably not discuss them until the NNG 
	meeting is over and the NNG Marketers are off the phone line.  At that time
	we can call the On Call TW Marketing Rep if needed.  

	If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn
