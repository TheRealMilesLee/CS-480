Profit Optimization Web Seminar on Natural Gas Trading

 
February 4, 2002-Houston- PROS Revenue Management, the world's leader in pricing and revenue optimization science and software, will host an Energy Profit Optimization Web Seminar for natural gas trading on February 7, 2002, 3:00 - 4:00pm Central Time.  This is the last chance to register.
 
The PROS Trading Optimization System utilizes PROS network optimization technology to optimally schedule natural gas volumes to market across multiple pipelines and provide buy/sell recommendations that maximize the revenue and utilization from all transportation assets.  In addition to the 10-15% profitability lift from optimal gas scheduling, the system also completely automates the scheduling process.  The PROS Trading Optimization System has been in live use since 2000.  Version 2.0 of the TOS system has been completely parameterized allowing companies to dynamically configure the system for multiple unique pipeline trading strategies and tariffs.  The result is the reduction of the gas scheduling process to less than 60 seconds.
 
These seminars will cover the basics of increasing revenues and profits while providing insight on how real-time data can be used to optimize profits.  The Web format will allow participants to attend from remote locations, ask questions in real-time, and interact with the presenter through an Internet browser and toll-free telephone number.  Participants of previous PROS seminars have found these sessions to be extremely helpful in improving their business and making them more valuable to their respective organizations.
 
PROS Revenue Management solutions have been credited with delivering 6-8% incremental revenue and 20-100% incremental profits.  These Web seminars will allow industry leaders to learn from the experience PROS has gained in over 17 years of deploying these solutions.
 
This seminar is free of charge, spaces are limited for a first come first served basis.  More information and registration can be found at: www.prosRM.com <http://www.prosrm.com/>.  Interested participants will be contacted to receive conference access information.
