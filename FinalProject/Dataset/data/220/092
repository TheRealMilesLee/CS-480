OK so it's really 20 under original plan but because of 8 extra IT folks we are showing just 12 under.

Please find attached the headcount reconciliation you requested.  I have added Su and Shahi to the Fundy's number for tracking purposes.  Given this, I show 12 open positions.  I need to compare my spreadsheets with our database to ensure we have similar info. If I find any discrepancies, I will let you know on Monday.
