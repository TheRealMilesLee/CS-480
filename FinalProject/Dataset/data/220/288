Corry, Don, Theresa and Tom.

I have asked OATI to reduce the number of accounts from 40 to 10 to reduce the costs for the estate.  Therefore I recommend we go down to the following accounts Enron01-10.

Please reply ASAP.

Thanks

Lloyd,
I am going to attach a document that contains the 40 users for EPMIE.
Please let me know which 30 users you would like me to delete, and I will
take care of that for you.  I will also let my billing department know to
change all of the contact information on your invoices to what you have
stated below.  Do you know if these are going to be the Entity names that
you will be using for UBS AG or will they be different.  Just let me know.
If you could let me know which users you would like deleted, I will get this
taken care of for you.
Thank you,
