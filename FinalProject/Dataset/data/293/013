Is This an Undiscovered Gem that is Positioned to Go Higher? Review 
Exactly What this Company Does.

Breaking News!!

Tiger Team Technologies Corporation (TTMT) has had an extremely 
positive first half of year 2005. The company set out goals in the beginning 
of the year, but did not foresee the progress that it has made. So far 
this year the company has secured short term funding, receeived a clean 
bill of health from its auditors and is therefore ready to file the 
necessary paperwork with the SEC to move to a better exchange, and 
finally, as noted in the previous press release dated June 25, 2004, the 
company is now being aggressively marketed in the Pacific Rim. 

Therefore, because Tiger Team has made inroads with major online 
retailers and internet transaction processors and wants to better service its 
clients here in the US and now being recruited in the Pacific Rim, the 
company has opened a new office in the San Francisco Bay Area. This 
office will compliment the one currently located where the company is 
headquartered in St. Paul, Minnesota. The company continues to garner 
interest from many market sectors and companies around the globe; thus, an 
expansion was only a natural outcome of the amazzing growth experienced 
this year. 

Tiger Team Technologies Corporation (TTMT) is pleased to announce that 
it has entered into a marketing agreement with Modern World Media, a 
leading Japanese marketing gr0up , to promote its products and services 
in the Japanese and Asian markets. This deal opens a completely new 
avenue for potential revenue and exposure as Tiger Team now looks to expand 
beyond the U.S. borders. 

Having a consistent presence in these two markets can only enhance the 
company's stature and in the long run, its profitability. A satisfied 
Paul Hogan, CEO of Tiger Team Technologies, stated that "the 0pp0rtunity 
for the company to introduce its products and services into the most 
sophisticated and fastest growing market in the world not only gives the 
company and international scope but will impact the company's bottom 
line in very significant ways for years to come. 

Modern World Media specializes in introducing new and innovative 
technologies to the Japanese and Asian markets, and is highly selective in 
the products and services that it chooses to introduce into the primary 
markets. Therefore, besides being excited about the prospects of having 
its product being marketed one of the fastest growing economic regions, 
Tiger Team also feels honored of having been chosen since the selection 
process by World Media is that stringent.
