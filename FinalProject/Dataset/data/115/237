awesome Dana -- congratulations! I know it will be a good change for you - do you know anybody in the new group?  I still can not believe how much the group has changed since I have been there!  Crazy stuff!

Have a great last day in Merchant Finance :)

Take care

Susan

Good Morning Sue -
I've been out sick for 2 days.  I'm going to the Global Counter party group on the 37th Flr.  
Yes, I am very happy about no more wires and signatures.
