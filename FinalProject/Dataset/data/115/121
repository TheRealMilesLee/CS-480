I have left Greg both a phonemail and email about our plans for the BoD meeting late today, and the handling of the limits.  He also will receive the documents this A.M.  Pls. touch base with him personally prior to the BoD meeting if you feel he will have any questions about the numbers.  Also, Rick, pls. touch base on your discussions with Pug after you make connection with him to give a heads up on if we are all on the same page. Thanks a lot.  Paula
