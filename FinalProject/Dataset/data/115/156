Sue,
 
Attached is a draft of the Petition which can be circulated.
 
I recommend that an Alliance member join the Alliance as a Petitioner to eliminate any issue about standing.  I am assuming that there is at least one willing member who was also a formal party to the proceeding which resulted in the Preferred Policy Decision.  Was the Alliance a formal party to that proceeding?
 
The basic structure of the Petition is complete.  I shall complile the Exhibits and then review same to determine whether the citations and to add any arguments which have been overlooked.
 
I would like to file on November 9.  I think that this Petition and the Commonwealth Petition should be filed on the same day.  If you concur, I will coordinate with Commonwealth's counsel.
 
I look forward to your comments.  EWD
