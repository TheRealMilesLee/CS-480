Dan, is it possible to see the AReM response to the Wood ACR before it is
filed tomorrow?  I am going to be preparing  the written prehearing
conference statement for Enron to be submitted to Barnett at the nov. 7 PHC
and I want to make sure we are being consistent in our approach.  Thank you.
Mike Day
