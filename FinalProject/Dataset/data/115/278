By the time you finish reading this management report, you'll have gained a working understanding of power market risk-management concepts and practices. 
Risk management is a structured discipline that uses well-defined policies and procedures to mitigate a company's credit, market, or operational risks. It's a way of looking at an unstable factor, such as fluctuating fuel prices, and finding ways to offset the risk of that instability. Our Survival Guide will give you the tools you need to make risk management an integral part of your power market business. You'll discover:

Ways to incorporate risk-management operations into your business strategy.
 
 
 
  <http://public.resdata.com/htmlmail/opri%20bullet.gif>

  <http://public.resdata.com/htmlmail/opri%20bullet.gif>
 
Workable strategies for monitoring and assessing risk-management operations. 
To corporate energy managers, risk management may mean understanding the risks and variable value of different commodities. Power market players need to run their plants and structure contracts to ensure that they'll be able to service debt and achieve a solid return. As new entrants join the power market, bringing risk-management experience from other sectors, existing players need to get up to speed quickly. The Survival Guide supplies exactly what information these professionals need to get started.
"Power Market Risk Management: A Survival Guide" focuses exclusively on risk management for power markets.
Risk management isn't gambling-it's business sense!
