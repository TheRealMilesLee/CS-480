FROM THE DESK OF MR SANKARA USMAN
OF AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNEX
OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA FASO.


             DEAR FRIEND
                                               ASSALA MUALEKUM

             I know that this letter may come to you as a surprise.I 
got 
your address through a local Business directory on the web.I must 
apologise 
for taking some of your valuable time to explain a proposal that I 
believe 
will be of utmost benefit to us .

I need your help and urgent assistance.I am the Bill and Exchange 
Manager of 
  African Development Bank,Ouagadouguo Burkina Faso.  In my department 
we 
discovered an abandoned sum of (11.300.000)ELEVEN MILLION THREE HUNDRED 
THOUSAND US DOLLARS, in an account that belongs to one of our foreign 
customer who died along with his surposed next of kin in 1999 plane 
crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his 
next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we can not release  it 
unless 
somebody applies for it as the next of kin or relation to the deceased, 
as 
indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that 
all his 
supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him in the plane 
crash 
leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that we decided to make this 
business 
proposals to you and release the money to you as next of kin  or 
relation to 
the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is 
coming 
for it because we don't want the money to go into the bank treasury as 
unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money 
remains 
unclaimed after  5 years, the money will be transferred into the bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request for a foreigner in this transaction is necessary because 
our 
late customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe can not stand as next of 
kin 
to a foreigner. we have agreed that 25% of this money will be for you 
as 
foreigner partner in respect of the provision of a foreign account.5% 
will 
be set aside for any mislenious expenses incurred  during the business 
and 
70% would be for me and my partner, after which we shall visit your 
country 
for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to your account 
as 
we have arranged,you will furnished me with your Bank account detail 
where 
the money will be transfered into from AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK  to 
your 
account,your private tel and fax number for easy communication.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail a text 
of 
the application which you shall retype and fax to our Foreign 
Remittance 
Department,for easy execution of the transaction.
I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% 
hitch-free on both side and has no atom of negativity,for we have made 
all 
required arrangement for the transfer of this fund to your account.

Please we would like  you to keep this transaction very confidential 
and as 
a top secret as you may wish to know that we are Bank officials.

Trusting to hear from you immediately,

  MR SANKARA USMAN
