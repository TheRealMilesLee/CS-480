Presented each year in conjunction with Hewlett-Packard, the Digital Economy Conference has established itself as a premiere annual gathering of the technology elite, and has featured the likes of Steve Jobs, Jim Barksdale, Jeff Bezos, Meg Whitman, Bob Metcalf, Mark Cuban and Linus Torvalds...in many cases, long before they were household names!

This year's Digital Economy Conference will again bring a dynamic delegation from all industries to explore best practices for achieving innovation and immediate ROI through the power of the Collaborate Enterprise. Participants will be briefed on the extraordinary economies that technology-forward companies are achieving by "working as one" over the Web.  By connecting with customers, suppliers and partners in new ways - both wired and wireless - these new Collaborative Enterprises are radically redefining business processes and creating new value propositions.

In addition to the business sessions, the conference will feature a special address by The Honorable James A. Baker, III, former U.S. Secretary of State (1989 - 1992) and former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury (1985 - 1988). A key strategist in the post-Cold War era, Mr. Baker will offer his informed perspective on U.S. response to the ongoing threat of global terrorism. His remarks, entitled Moving Forward: What's America's Role in the World? are not to be missed.
