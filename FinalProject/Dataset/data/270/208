to any client who does not see results within four weeks." Mr. West further stated,<BR> 
"We will begin aggressive marketing of our product line over the internet and radio during the next 3 months.<BR> 
We anticipate capturing one percent of sales from the 60 million balding men and women within the United States.<BR> 
Our first year revenue projections are estimated to be in excess of $1.5 million.<BR> 
As we continue increasing our revenue and marketing, we will expand nationally and prepare to move to a new exchange.<BR>
