Subject: We promiss you sex
X-Mailer: KYX-CP/M FNORD-5604


There is this free date site filled with a bunch of sexoholics.

No flowers, no walk on the beach, just meet up for sex :)

There are also some people who want serious relationships though
So if you want a long-termer, or a one-nighter, you got it ;)

Whatever floats your boat pretty much!
