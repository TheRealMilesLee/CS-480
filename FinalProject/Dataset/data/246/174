Attn.: Russian Investment Opportunity.


Dear Sir or Madam,



INTRODUCTION:


My name is alexei  alennikov, I am one of Mr. Mikhail Khodorkovsky's

personal treasurers.

Mr. Khodorkovsky was once one of the richest men in Russia.
Mr. Khodorkovsky is owner of the following companies:


Chairman CEO: YUKOS OIL (Russia's Largest Oil Company)

Chairman CEO: Menatep SBP Bank (A well known and well respected
financial institution with branches all over the world)


Situation:

Some while ago whilst in the process of crediting certain funds, via
various European security and finance companies , Mr. Khodorkovsky was
arrested for his political involvement in the financing of political
parties which posed a threat to President Vladimir Putin's second tenure
as
Russian president.

Due to these facts, Yukos Oil has been forced to file under chapter 11
for bankruptcy. Ironically the shares of our largest conglomerates was
dubiously and specially orchestrated by Putin and sold to a local coy
just last week.
Due to the situation wit regards to Mr. Mikhail Khodorkovsky 'arrest'
and the recent takeover of the petroleum industry by the Russian
Government I have an amount in excess of $21.5M USD which I seek your hel=
p
and
'business advice' in acquiring access to.


SOURCE OF FUNDS:


The documents that allow me access to the funds in question were handed
over to me [in the form of payment] by a United Stats based oil
merchant with regards to previous business done by him and Mr. Khodorkovs=
ky.

The funds are currently held by a European security and finance company
who are charged with allocating and the final crediting of held funds.

At completion of business, should you agree to help me, you will be
rewarded with the sum of 15% of the aforementioned sum  in cash to an acc=
ount
of your choice for your
'advisory' input as a 'consultant'.


YOUR ROLE:


All I need from you is for you to agree to stand as the beneficiary of
the above mentioned sum. I will arrange for the documentation to be
translated and filed with the relevant agencies which will enable the
European finance company transfer the sum to an account.

As soon as I receive confirmation of your readiness to go ahead with
the transfer of funds I will send you all the appropriate documentation
that you need to continue including details of the European finance
house concerned with this transaction.


Sincerely



Mr. alexei  alennikov
