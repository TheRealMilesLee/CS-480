Does it make sense to try to get together to talk about Bridgeline?  I am not sure if you tried to contact Jean but from what I understand, I suspect that she is not willing to help.  Maybe, we gather everyone else that knows anything about the deal, put them all in a room and extract as much info as possible.  Then, we can try to summarize the state of affairs and recommend various courses of action.  Your thoughts.
