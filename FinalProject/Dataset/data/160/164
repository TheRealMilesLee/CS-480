Dear Investor: 

My name is Ken Fisher. I write the "Portfolio Strategy" 
Column for Forbes magazine and serve as Chairman 
and Chief Investment Officer of Fisher Investments, Inc. 
My firm manages over $7.5 billion for institutions and 
high-net-worth individuals. 
   
I recognize you may not be considering doing anything 
differently with your investments right now. Regardless, 
I'd like to send you a kit of useful insights you can't get 
anywhere else free and without obligation.  

As soon as you fill out the online-request form, I'll 
email you the latest version of my Quarterly Report. 
It's designed to be interesting to investors whether they 
are interested in the full service we specialize in or 
not. The report, which I update with my latest 
thinking, highlights my viewpoint on: 
 
- Which stocks to select for investment now 

- The right balance between equities, fixed income 
securities and cash in this volatile market 

- The role mutual funds play in the portfolios 
of high-net-worth individuals 

- The impact of the Federal Reserve's actions 
on your investment strategy 
 
Fisher Investments' latest private Quarterly 
Report normally is given, along with their 
investment results, only to our clients. Each 
one has at least $500,000 in our care. 
After you have requested the Report, you will 
have the chance to review my Seminar on Money
Management. I strongly encourage you to visit 
the Seminar. It reveals the strengths and weaknesses 
of management options available to people like yourself. 

The reason I'm offering you this extensive intellectual
capital at my expense: I've found educating 
high-net-worth investors is good for our investment 
management business, whether any individual becomes 
a client or not. 

Some, for whom our outstanding client service and 
strong results are attractive, become clients. Others 
simply listen, learn and use our advice to inform their 
own management. But they tell their friends, some of 
whom prefer to have the details taken care of for them. 

Whichever group you fall into, please allow me to 
give you the benefit of my firm's original research 
and my thinking. I'm certain you'll find it interesting 
and useful. And, of course, FREE and without obligation. 

Thanks for your attention. I look forward to hearing 
from you. 

Sincerely, 

Kenneth L. Fisher 
Chairman and Chief Investment Officer
