Dear Rick,

I quickly wanted to send you my new contact information as well as ask you
about my Cash Balance Plan.  My fifth anniversary with Enron is coming up
this Sunday, December 9.

The Cash Balance Plan vests after five years and I want to make sure that
HR's comments to me regarding the plan are right.  HR (Sheila Walton) told
me last week that I need not to worry about vesting in the plan since we
will officially still be Enron employees as long as we are getting paid
severance.  With the latest information we got this seems to be questionable
now.  HR and Benefits do not seem to know what is going on now; all my
questions remained unanswered when I called them this morning.  Benefits
stated that as long as my termination date was after the 9th of December I
would vest.  HR doesn't seem to know when my official termination date is.
If needed, I have more than 10 days of unused vacation; I could be deemed on
vacation and terminated after the 9th.

I would like to ask you to help me with this matter and try to set my
termination date after December 9, i.e. at the earliest next Monday.  I feel
that the company has left us with absolutely nothing but an extreme lack of
information and loads of unanswered questions. I do not see myself in a
position where I want to give my Cash Balance Plan up.

My contact information is:

Thanks again for all your efforts, I really enjoyed my time in RAC, and you
were right, I did learn many useful tools for my future endeavors.

Best regards,

Carol North
