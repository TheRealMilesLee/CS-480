Hello to our members:

We greet you again on the Ides of March with our next investment profile. =
 As the spring flowers begin too pop-up out of the ground we have a stock =
that we feel will begin to bloom into a beautiful stock profit.

DSI Direct Sales Inc. 
(Pink Sheets: DSDI)
finance.yahoo.com/q?s=3DDSDI.PK
Outstanding Shares: 110,750,000
Current Price: $0.08
Accumulate to: $0.50
Profit target: $1.00

With the purchase of the new building and equipment DSI has successfully p=
ositioned itself for substantial growth. Throughout the past year, and con=
current with their move, they have been forging relationships with new cli=
ents in their region, throughout the U.S. and in several international mar=
kets. DSI's Marketing Department has also been focused on strengthening th=
eir current client base and explaining the new expanded services they offe=
r. The Production Department is in negotiations and acquiring new equipmen=
t including enhanced large format devices to be installed by the end of Q2=
 and variable data digital printing equipment sometime in the near future.=
 With their current production
capability and with a new sales and training program to be implemented in =
Q1, we envision over a 30% increase in sales in fiscal 2005. Once the new =
equipment is online management believes sales will increase over 70=
% in fiscal year 2006.

The Keys to success for DSI are:

Anticipate client's needs.
Develop value added programs to avoid becoming a commodity to our customer=
s.
Stay in front of the curve on equipment investments to maintain industry l=
eadership.
Carefully plan ROI on all capital expenditures.
Listen to our customers and translate technology into a solution.
Cultivate more profitable relationships and issue credit carefully.


The new and emerging technology of large format imaging, while a natural f=
it for DSI, has not been embraced by the majority of our competitors. This=
 is probably because the implementation is fairly complex and a company mu=
st have electronic prepress strength to do so. This service is very lucrat=
ive and creates sales opportunity that often leads to printing projects fo=
r DSI.

Information Management, AKA "The Vault", has been a tremendous tool DSI pu=
ts in the hands of its clients as well as being a great image enhancer as =
to their understanding of the Internet and how to leverage it on behalf of=
 the customer. This application is utilized by companies that have either =
many digital assets or many people in many places that need to have access=
 to them. By organizing company's digital files into user friendly data ba=
ses which can be accessed over the Internet, DSI builds a very strong bond=
 with the client that uses it. To date many of DSI's competitors have negl=
ected to implement such a system.


We at Growth Capital are very excited about this ground breaking opportuni=
ty to invest in a well established company in a well established industry.=
  What makes it even more attractive is that the price of DSDI is at a cur=
rent low.  Buy Low, Sell High, that is what we do here at Capital Growth a=
nd we will be big buyers of this stock over the next week. We suggest you =
buy some now before the price gets too high ($.50).  We will keep you upda=
ted as to our position in DSDI.

We hope that you have enjoyed this installment of the Growth Capital Newsl=
etter and look for our next hot issue.
