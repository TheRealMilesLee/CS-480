Rod,
how was the holiday. i hope not as exhausting as mine.
i assume that Cindy Olsen has yet to get you an answer.  Enron may get a
little bump in anticipation of a positive earnings release.  This may give
us an opportunity to create some sort of hedge/collar.  Let me know as soon
as you find out.
Erik
