Here are the results of the third week.  Barrie is the first place
winner--due no doubt to the fact that her daughter lives in Ohio--so Barrie
picked both Cincinnati AND Cleveland to win.  Second place goes to Andy, and
Cary and Eldon tied for 3rd.

Two more  players sat down when Minnesota lost, so Nancy and the Deitrick's
are out of the Last Person Standing  pool.

And here's an explanation of the different worksheets in the file:

Week #3.   There will always be a worksheet with the results for  the  week,
It also shows ranking and total points.  It is sorted  by the total points
for the current week.

YTD Standings.  This worksheet shows the cumulative points and ranking.  It
is sorted  by  total points.

LPS.  Status of Last Person Standing pool.  An "x" above a name indicates
that that person is no longer standing.  Also, you can see which teams you
have picked  in the past.

PAYOUT. Shows the money winners each week and the cumulative total.  Sorted
by dollars won.

There may be other weeks still showing, but Nancy drops them off as the
season progresses so the file does not get too big.  Please call if you have
any question about this or you spot an error somewhere.
