I am Mr. Bo Lee Wang, Bank Official of Banco Nacional Ultramarino , Macau
Branch,Macau, China.

On December 6, 2001, an Oil consultant/contractor with the China petroluem
and Chemical Corp., The customer made a numbered time (Fixed)
Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$128,000,000.00 (One
Hundred and Twenty Eight Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I
sent a
routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a
month, we sent a reminder and finally we
discovered from his contract employers, the Oman Oil Company that the
customer died from an automobile accident.
that the customer died from an automobile accident. On further
investigation, I found out that he died without
making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I
therefore made further investigation and
discovered that he did not declare any kin or relations in all his official
documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in
my Bank. This sum of US$128,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the
interest is being rolled over with the principal
sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.
According to Laws of Republic of China, at the
expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the
Chinese Government if nobody applies to claim
the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand
in as the next of kin of the deceased
customer so that the fruits of this  old man's labor will not get into the
hands of some corrupt government officials. This
is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and
address so that the attorney will prepare the
necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next
of kin.We shall employ the services of an attorney
for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary
documents and letter of probate/administration in
your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that
you will provide will then facilitate the transfer
of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid
into your account for us to share in the ratio of
90% for me and 10% for you.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be
done by the attorney and my position as
the Branch official guarantees the successful execution of this
transaction. If you are interested, please reply
immediately via the private email address above. Upon your response, I
shall then provide you with more details and
relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please
send me your confidential telephone and
fax numbers for easy communication. Please observe utmost confidentiality,
and rest assured that this transaction would
be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance
to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply via my email address.

Thanks and regards.

Mr. Bo Lee Wang
