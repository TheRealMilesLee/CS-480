Atlanta-based energy provider Mirant will fund at least $50 million in initiatives to help find solutions to global climate change, it announced recently. The investment, which will be made over 10 years, is one of several projects outlined in the company's first annual environmental report. 
"This funding is a further investment in the development of a progressive environmental program that can benefit the global community in which we operate," said Mirant President and CEO Marce Fuller. 
Mirant's environmental report outlines the company's commitment to fund climate change initiatives, including greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation projects to help offset its CO2 emissions, such as carbon sequestration projects. The company will also fund research develop less carbon- intensive generation technologies. 
Additionally, renewable energy will play an important role in meeting global energy the company will pursue opportunities to develop and invest in renewable generation projects. "Mirant expects that Europe offers many of the best opportunities for investment in renewable energy given the targets set by several European Union countries to increase their share of renewables," said Barney Rush, CEO of Mirant's European business group. 
Mirant's environmental report also features several environmental initiatives the company has developed, including establishment of environmental performance indicators to set improvement targets and measure performance and a commitment to develop air emissions reduction goals.
