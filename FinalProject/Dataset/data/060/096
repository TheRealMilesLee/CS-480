Dear sir/madam

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I belie=
ve
everyone will die someday. My name is MUSTAPHA WAZIRI a merchant in Dubai=
,
in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer . It has defile=
d
all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few mon=
ths
to live, according to medical experts.I have not particularly lived my li=
fe
so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my busine=
ss.


Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to peop=
le
and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. B=
ut
now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just
wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gi=
ves
me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different=

way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed a=
nd
given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family
members as well as a few close friends.

 I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to=

give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charit=
y
organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked memb=
ers
of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I=

have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused=

and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as
they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of ei=
ghteen
million united states dollars $18,000,000,00 that I have with a finance/S=
ecurity
Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispa=
tched
it to charity organizations. I have also set out 10% of this money to be
giving to the less privileged affected in the recent Tsunami Disaster in
Asia( Sri lanka, indonesia and Thailand) 15% has being set aside for you
and for your time.

You are to respond through my personal and safe email address.
God be with you.

Regards
Mr. Mustapha Waziri.
