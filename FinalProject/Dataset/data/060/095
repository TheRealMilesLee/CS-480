Good Morning!

This was shared with me and it is too neat!!  I hope you have Power Point
or another type of presentation software on your computer.  It's a little
long, but it is worth the time!  You can click anywhere on the screen in
order to speed the presentation up if you want to, but trust me, it is very
encouraging to read all the way through because it shares several of the
promises our Father gives us....one on each slide.

I hope you are blessed by being reminded of just a few of the many promises
the Word of God gives us because the only way we can deal with situations
like the one our country is facing right now and have peace and not be in
fear is through the living truth of Word of God.

Have a wonderful day!!!!

Peace and Love,

Constance
