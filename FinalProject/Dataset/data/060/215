Mark,

I have created the product using the language that Leslie requires.  If you need more than this to sign-off on the Product type, please let me know.

Kevin and Chris:

The spread looks fine except for one minor point.  I'd included a parenthetical defined term at the end fo section (A) of the product long description so that it would be clear in section (B) that Firm (LD) energy was as defined in Schedule P of the EEI agreement.  You deleted the reference.  Please include the parenthetical or give me a call to discuss leaving it out if you prefer.

Thanks,

Leslie
