Steve Hall and I do not prepare ISDAs.  They have to be prepared by the ISDA group in Houston.  A former ISDA trading attorney in Houston, Carol St. Claire, recently helped  us negotiate a couple of ISDAs with Benton and Franklin PUD's.  We should see if she can help us with this one, and if not, it has to go into the ISDA kingdom through a door opened by one Tana Jones.  Perhaps they can sort it out and let us know after reading this message. ----cgy

Legal,

Per the request of Stewart Rosman, please prepare an ISDA between Public Utility District Number One of Grays Harbor and ENA.  Credit concerns should be addressed to Tracy Ngo or myself.

Thank you,

Susan
