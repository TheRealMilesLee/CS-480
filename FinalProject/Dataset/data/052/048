Attention;


PRIVATE AND URGENT.

I am contacting you in regards to a business transfer
of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though
I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make
anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you
that all will be well at the end of the day. We
decided to contact you due to the urgency of this
transaction.

PROPOSITION;

We discovered an abandoned sum of (Nine Million United
states Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of
our foreign customers who died along with his entire
family.. 

Since his death, none of his next-of-kin or relations
has come forward to lay claims to this money as the
heir. We cannot release the fund from his account
unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to
the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.
Upon this discovery, we now seek your permission to
have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased as all
documentations will be carefully worked out by us for
the funds (Nine Million United states Dollars) to be
released in your favor as the beneficiary's next of
kin.

It may interest you to note that we have secured from
the probate an order of madamus to locate any of
deceased beneficiaries. Please acknowledge receipt of
this message in acceptance of our mutual business
endeavor by furnishing me with the following;

1. Your Full Names and Address.
2. Direct Telephone and Fax numbers.

These requirements will enable us file a letter of
claim to the appropriate departments for necessary
approvals in your favour before the transfer can be
made. We shall be compensating you with 3 Million
Dollars on final conclusion of this project, while the
rest shall be for us. Your share stays with you while
the rest shall be for us for investment purposes in
your country.

If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take
undue advantage of the trust we have bestowed in you,
I await your urgent email.

Regards,
WILLIAM OBOH.
