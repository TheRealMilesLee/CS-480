Hi Barry.Tycholiz, 
<p>
If you seek treatment, the recommendations you receive will likely depend on the specific symptoms you have experienced, their duration and severity, and any previous history of depression. As you consider your treatment options, you should assess the relative costs and benefits of different forms of treatment. For example, there are some possible side effects associated with anti-depressant medications, but these medications are often a very effective and expedient form of treatment. Frequently, psychotherapy can be a very useful way of resolving emotional and interpersonal problems associated with depression, but it does requires a commitment of your time and energy. All of the depressive conditions are highly treatable and many individuals experience a full recovery from their symptoms. You are encouraged to discuss any questions or concerns you may have about treatment with a counselor or physician.
