See attached memo.  Greg Whiting will be directly in charge of acctg for Sithe and monitoring the income and cash flows.  We are expecting approx $6.8 mm in 2002 earnings which we can monitor against that expectation.  I have told them to take any earnings against the intangible asset as you and I have discussed.  If you want to edit this we can sit down with you and do so.  

Is there someone you want commercially responsible?

Here are all the pieces and the accounting.  I will send the to-date numbers in a separate email.

Hopefully this will cover what Wes is looking for.  More can be added, but these are the high points.
