Ed and I took part in the discussion with Calger's guys on the West Power assets.  We worked through the top four assets regarding status, value, current activity and forward strategy.  By Monday Calger is going to try to have put together an estimate of burn rate on the top 25 contracts, potential supply sources for power/ gas, cash needs for contracts to maintain performance and a list of potential buyers/ assignees.  We are going to try to have another quick conference call on Monday to discuss what has been put together.
