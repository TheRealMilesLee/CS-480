Marlene,

Thanks for the email.  Ok, I'll tell you more; I'm 36, I live in Broomfield but work downtown.  I'm currently looking to sell my place in Broomfield and move west into the area around Golden.  Maybe Lookout Mountain or Genesee, Broomfield is ok when you're married, which I was for 4 years now divorced two, but alittle far from everything when you're single.  Athletic but only competitive when provoked.  How am I doing so far?

I moved to Colorado from Texas (San Antonio) in 1992, and I don't think I'm going back, although I'm in the energy business which is run primarily out of Houston, TX.  No pets or kids due to the fact that I travel somewhat frequently for my job and pleasure.  Well at least the travel and pets part the kid's part is for other reasons, which I'm sure you can imagine.  I like to ski but prefer the summer better.  And finally, if I get this job I'll work very hard to insure this company remains profitable and loyal to it's customers.  Oh sorry I got off on a tangent.

So now it's your turn, "tell me more."


Paul
