Ed, Eric,

I have confirmed with Jeff Hodge regarding the termination of this contract.  At this time, the contract is effectively terminated as Bankruptcy causes a triggering event to terminate, although no notice has been received by ENA from the Counterparty with respect to a termination payment.  After talking to Jeff, he explained (as stated in the contract) that the Affected Party shall pay the Termination Payment to the Notifying Party.  Since ENA is the Affected Party, no payment would need to be made, as the contract is in the money to ENA.  

**With respect to ENA sending a Termination Payment Notice to the Counterparty, please ensure no notice is generated to affect the timing/value of the potential asset sale of which Fred Mitro is involved.

Thank you,
Russell.
