The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a |ong-term bu|l market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oi| Be|t"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Millions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-We|| Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverab|e Reserves
South Texas in a large existing fie|d that was discovered and dril|ed 
by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The fie|d is established with substantial recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi||ion barrels of oi| and about 2 bi|lion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbol - EOGI
Price   - .075

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|l skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bul|
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-mi||ions, EOGI is selling for |ess than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particularly c|ose attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This small company
with a comparab|y sma|l market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But all that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wi|l the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
dec|ine
s|ight|y, you wil| sti|l make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wil|
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wil| be 
staggering.

Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares wi|| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are wel| estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area will really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bul|etin.
