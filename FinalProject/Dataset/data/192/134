We are not testing all scripts today. The purpose of today's test is to verify that the test scripts contain all the steps needed for Sunday. On Sunday, we will run through all the test we developed this week.

The attached scripts were not scheduled for.  Has there been a change I am not aware of?
 
Thanks,

Everyone,
 
I have attached the preliminary schedule for tomorrow's test of the integration test scripts. For those individuals, who have been identified to participate in the test and are unable to attend at your scheduled time, please send me the name of your substitute as soon as possible. The current schedule allows plenty of time for each step. If the test is ahead of schedule, we may call you in at an earlier time.
 
Thank You,
 
Terry
