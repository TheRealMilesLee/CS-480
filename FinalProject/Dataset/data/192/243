It is proposed that these will be transferred to the Netco.  The hardware and software were purchased by ENA or EPMI (I have been trying to obtain the answer to this question from accounting).  It is proposed that the $1.5 million outstanding payable to the vendor ESCA would remain with the estate.  Please let me know if you have a problem with this.
