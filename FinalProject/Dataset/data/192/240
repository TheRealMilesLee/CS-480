When E-Tag 1.7 is activated on March 6, 2002 the OATI webTag (ETS) system will require secure access using an OATI Digital Certificate.  OATI Digital Certificates will be provided to our existing webTag customers at no additional cost under their existing ETS Agreement.

For those companies that have not yet acquired OATI Digital Certificates, to start the process, please download the Company Information document at the following URL:

http://www.oaticerts.com/repository/company_information.doc

Complete the form, and then e-mail it to OATI at support@oatiinc.com.  Please do not delay, get this service today to avoid access problems on March 6.

For those companies that have already acquired OATI Digital Certificates, our OATI webTag Administrator will be contacting your company shortly to activate this service with your current E-Tag 1.67 access.

If you have questions, please feel free to contact us at (763) 553-2725 or support@oatiinc.com.
