Can you guys help try to resolve these differences?  We may have to write them off anyways, but we need to know what they relate to.  I think Phyllis Kennedy should be able to provide some more detail.  Thanks

Richard

Attached is a spreadsheet with the potential write offs in 12/01 general ledger.  In addition, I think Phyllis talked to you about other changed - i.e. we will not be booking UA4 or FTA in 12/01 general ledger.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I am not sure of the process on our end, I have submitted this information to Greg Whiting who is going to submit it to his boss, etc.  I will let you know when I hear something back from them and please let me know if there is a problem on your end.

thanks
Lisa
