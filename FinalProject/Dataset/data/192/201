Kimberly,/Rhonda --  (1) As mentioned on a voicemail to Rhonda, the 1996 Modesto  enabling agreement (96000724) does not have auto termination while the 1999 Enabling agreement does. Can you give Stacey White guidance as to the transactions under each?  Thanks.

David,

Attached is the spreadsheet containing the contract #, names and dates for the non-terminated counterparties. Should you have any question or need me to research any information further, please let me know. 

Regards,

Kimberly
