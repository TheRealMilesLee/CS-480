GNSS as a long candidate. 

GNSS gaps over resistance at 70 so the move constitutes a breakout. BRCM did the same thing today taking resistance at 50. a close beneath the 13-day EMA constitutes the roving cautionary flag as GNSS has had an excellent relationship with the 13-day EMA since the green bar birthed in november. GNSS has not closed beneath the 13-day EMA since. so the 13-day EMA is the yardstick. 

waiting i am for the next julianna hatfield concert! unfortunately the best thing to be had at the local casino of choice is Styx.
