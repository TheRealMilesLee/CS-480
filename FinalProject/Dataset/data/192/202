Hi, Sweethearts,
 
I want to let you know that Michael's father passed away yesterday  morning. He had been feeling bad for about a month and last week he passed out and hurt himself. At the hospital they found out that he had a bleeding ulcer that made him faint. They took had to take him off the blood thinners and they were giving him medication for the ulcer and sent him home Tuesday night. Wednesday morning he must have had a blood clot that caused a heart attack. Crystal and Jamie did cpr which started his heart again but then it stopped. 
 
Michael is in Denver and is going to Alamo tonight for the funeral on Saturday. The kids and I aren't going since Michael has to leave for Denver and then North Dakota on Sunday and he doesn't want me trying to drive out there alone with the kids. Michael was training on Wednesday so I waited to tell him until lunch. He is blessed that two of his good friends were there and they have helped him deal with his loss (one of them is exactly Michael's age and is dying of lymphoma...he has 5 children, the youngest just 7).
 
Michael seems to be doing fine, although the funeral will be hard. His family will be in a financial crisis, though. Please pray with us for them that God helps them through their pain and hard decisions.
 
Mandi, I hope your move goes without problems. 
 
I love you all,
 
Mom
