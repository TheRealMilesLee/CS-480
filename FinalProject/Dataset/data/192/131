Subject:	Latest update on Sublette 26

 Sublette 26 made test on the third try last night. All area's of the test were successful. The unit will ship to Sublette Sunday and the Solar Rep's will be on sight Monday morning to install the unit. We will have Lormar Reclamation on sight Tuesday t clean the oil reservoir, piping and oil itself. Team Rep (Mike Burnham) made it home late last night and is back on sight at Sublette making the final arrangements for the installation process. I want to thank Mike for all his efforts throughout this process. He did an excellent job.
