Good morning. Yes, I did look at the annuity link. It looks good to me. It
is run by an insurance company. Thus, I assume there will be not only the
standard fees charged by whatever mutual fund in which you invest, but some
charge made by the ins. co. Thus, you should make certain those charges are
reasonable and defined. Additional, if the your money is actually paid by
you to the ins. co.( verses directly to the specific mutual funds) to be
invested, which I suspect is the case, then you must select a financially
strong ins.co. Do not want an Enron fiasco with this type of retirement
investment. Let me know if you have any questions. Love-Dad

Hey Dad,





Did you get the link I sent on the Def Ann?  If so, what do you think?  Is
there anything I missed?

I am still waiting on a couple of RSVPs for the bachelor party so I will let
you know on the transport.

How are things otherwise?
