Sally - 

Thanks for your call.  Attached is the Gas Risk data Jeff provided me today.  I may not have mentioned it in our conversation, but Louise is also looking for a brief explanation as to why a person should be nominated for a promotion.  For any promotions you propose, please develop a few bullets to explain the reasons for this action.  Please call if you or Bob have any questions.  

Thanks - Tana

PS  - I am going to comp now to get the ranges and will forward those as well.
