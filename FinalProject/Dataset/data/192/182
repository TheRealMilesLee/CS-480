Sally - per our discussion this morning regarding Todd's issue please see the follow-up message from Evelyn below.  I have left a message for Todd to call me as well as spoken with Kevin Sweeney.  Kevin and I will be meeting in the next few days to ensure that on a going forward basis all the gaps are identified and closed.  If you have any questions, let me know.  Thanks, Leslie

Scott Tacket has made numerous requests for the deal spec information he needs to process settlements and he does not have it yet. He is contacting Todd Hall about it again and stressing that it is urgent.
