I've given Rita a few comments to discuss with Elizabeth, but as always she has done a great job of pulling this info together.  One item I want to make sure we all watch for , is that we have not reported any fuel sales as part of transport deliveries regardless of location.    Good job Elizabeth and others    MK

Rita,

See the file below for your review.  Please note the outstanding items also.  Did you have a chance to get a list of past data requests from Naomi?

Let me know if you have any questions.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Here are the preliminary reports ready for your review.  Fields highlighted in pink require updates by others:

Item 1 - TK to input daily rates into CBS for remaining contracts
Item 3 - Darrell and Terry to review the PFS tab and make appropriate footnote cross-references between the PDS and PFS records
Item 4 - Don Powell's query for Item 3 seems to retrieving accurate data, so I will give him the go ahead to process Item 4

Lindy/TK - Please verify the rates I have entered into CBS for those contracts identified in Item 1.

Please let me know ASAP if there are any questions/concerns with regard to the reports.  My plan is to send the file out to Rita Bianchi by mid-day Tuesday for Omaha to review.
