Hello all.
 
I just spoke with Dan Wayland at TFS.  He said that a college education fund has been established in Robby's son's name.  
 
I am sending this message out to all of those people who knew Rob or who have mentioned wanting to contribute to such a fund if it should come about.  I recognize that all of you may not have known Rob as well as I did.  Also, some of you have been impacted by the loss of many friends in this tragedy and may not be able to contribute to every fund.  Still, I wanted you to be aware of this one.
 
Checks should be made payable to:
 
The Charles A. Noonan Educational Foundation
 
...and be sent to: 
 
The Charles A. Noonan Educational Foundation 
c/o Craig Polar
89 Lower Cross Road
Greenwich, CT 06830
 
If you have questions, please call  Craig Polar at 917-691-5153.
 
Thank you,
 
Kurt
