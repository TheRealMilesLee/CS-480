On September 10, each of the UDCs filed applications to change distribution
level standby rates.  In Decision 01-07-027, the Commission had directed
the UDCs to file such applications to propose distributed generation standby
rates in conformity with certain requirements set forth in that decision.
These standby rates are to viewed as interim, subject to change in
individual utility proceedings.

I have not reviewed the applications thoroughly.  Please let me know if you
would like me to do such or whether you wold like a copy of the applications
( I do have two of the three UDCs electronically).
