Tom,

With respect to this NDA, do you want us to send it directly to Deloitte, or do you want to send it to them?  If you would like us to send it to them I am going to need an email address...

Let me know what you prefer...

Tana -

Could you please prepare an NDA for Deloitte Consulting (at the Boston address that is in the Jake Staffle NDA) for CommodityLogic.  The subject matter should be generic as they are looking at Deloitte to provide some basic accounting and compliance auditing services.

Thanks.

Mark
