Laurie,

We're still working on cleaning up July.  I'm here in Houston working with Gloria on some historic accounting issues and we'll be getting back to July probably by early next week.  Please hold off on sending anything out until then.

It would probably be sooner, however, we have an all day meeting on Monday so I won't be able to work on it until Tuesday.

let me know if this is a problem.

Thanks,
Theresa

Theresa, this was changed from 81,730 to 76,855??  Can you send the pipe support so I can recoup?

Thanks
Laurie

Laurie,
Please redraft again.    I think we have it fixed.  We show it should be 81,730.  (They show 81833, however, our pipe support is 81,730).

Let me know.

We have differences between the 2 pipeline backup.  FUGG shows 81,730 and KN shows 81,833.
Can you redraft (i see it's finalized) this and see what volume you get now?

Hey Theresa, I did not hear from you yesterday afternoon - just wondering if you were able to finalize the FUGG volumes?  If you need the support Retex sent, I will be happy to fax it.

Laurie ,

I would be the one to help with this.  I am getting support from Fort Union and will let you know.  We are still finalizing volumes on FUGG.

It should be early this afternoon.

Theresa, we have sales to Retex for 0701 on FUGG totaling 75,730 MMBtu's.  This volume is on deals 896559 and 921936.  Retex has sent support showing that this volume should be 81,833 MMBtu's.  Could you let me know who can help with this?  Thanks.
