I spoke to the three primary Senate consultants dealing with energy.  As of
9:30 a.m. this morning the Governor has still not officially called for a
Third Extraordinary Session, or, for the Second Extraordinary Session to
reconvene.  In fact, Senate staff is continuing to prepare for their annual
golf excursion next Tuesday. In addition, while staff from the Senate and
the Administration have met, the Administration has yet to produce either a
new version of SBX2 78, or, amendments to the existing version of SBX2 78.
Staff reiterated that they believe there is still no chance of passing SBX2
78 in its current form.
