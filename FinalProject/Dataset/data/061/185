We haven't lost the Smurfit deal yet, but the client believes it is taking us too long to clarify our credit parameters for this deal.  

The individuals in Bill Bradford's group are extremely qualified and hard working.  There are just not enough of them.  We greatly appreciate your considering if additional resources are needed.
