Jeff, 

No action is required on your part at this time. This memo was in response to your question in the weekly EGM staff meeting. 

Iain Greig and Randal Frisbie will be in touch in the next couple of weeks. We would like to set up a meeting to discuss your vision for the next release of Position Manager. New requirements (e.g. - backward cumulative roll) that you mentioned in the demo are already being planned for. 

Ideally, we'd like to install MoneyPenny onto your desk top so that you can use it and help us understand what other things need to be added. 

Thanks.

Jeff, 

Here are a few deliverables that should provide answers to the question you posed on Monday about Thunderball. 

1) The first spreadsheet lists the traders and risk analysts in each office that are involved in user acceptance testing for Position Manager and the schedule for signoff. (User Rollout 626.xls)

2) The second document higlights current overall status for the Moneypenny trading application. (DevStat625.doc)

3) The third document highlights future Position Manager functionality. This is an initial draft that will be confirmed with key traders as well as Todd Hall.  We will then set up a meeting to get your input and review. Note, this includes key requirements that you requested in the system demo such as support for a Cumulative Backward Roll view within Position Manager. (PosMgrR2...)

Let me know if you have further questions. 

Thanks.
