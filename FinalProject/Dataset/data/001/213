Market Participants: 

> Summer Reliability Contract Capacity Payment/Charge
> Charge Type 1120
> 
> To assist in meeting the peak demand conditions during the summer period,
> the California Independent System Operator contracted for new generation
> through the Summer Reliability Agreements (SRA).  On March 30th the ISO
> Board directed management to recover costs incurred under the Summer
> Reliability Agreements as provided in the ISO Tariff Section 2.3.5.1.8. 
> 
> The SRA Fixed Charge amounts will be charged through Charge Type 1120
> (Summer Reliability Contract Capacity Payment/Charge) on the Preliminary
> statement for the last day of the Trade month before payment is due. The
> ISO will charge the market based on an estimate of the metered Demand
> (including Exports). This will be the month just prior to the actual
> billing month.  For example, the June 2001 charges will be entered on the
> Preliminary Statement for Trade Date 5/31/01.  The SRA charges will then
> be adjusted including penalties and offsets on the Final statement for
> Trade Date 6/30/01 (the last day of each actual billing month) to match
> actual charges calculated based on metered Demand (including Exports). 
> 
> The first charge for June 2001 will appear on the Preliminary Statement
> for Trade Date May 31, 2001.  This Preliminary Statement will publish on
> July 25, 2001.  Adjustments for June 2001 will appear on the Final
> Statement for Trade Date 6/30/01, which will publish on September 12,
> 2001.
> 
> CT 1120 will be a manual charge type within the Manual Line Item Records.
> No structural changes will occur in the Specification for Settlement
> Statement Files, Version 13.0c.
