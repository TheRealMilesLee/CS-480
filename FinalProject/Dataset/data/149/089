Yeah, our offense was pathetic and OSU played really well.  Our defense
is tough but you don't deserve to play for championships when you
have 0 yards rushing against a defense that gave up over 1100 yards
in its last two games including 517 to freakin Baylor.   Best of luck
against Colorado.  I wonder which team will show up?
