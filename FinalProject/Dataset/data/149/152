JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Jacksonville Jaguars receiver Jimmy Smith tested
positive for cocaine after police stopped him Nov. 11 on suspicion of
drunken driving, but he will not be prosecuted.

Smith could face disciplinary action from the NFL for violating the league's
substance abuse policy.

NFL spokesman Dan Masonson said the league was reviewing Smith's case.

Smith denied having taken cocaine, and said he was trying to figure out how
the test could have returned positive.

"I've never done it, don't do it and don't plan to do it," Smith said. "I
just hate for my name to be associated with anything like that, ever. Since
I've been here, I've been a good role model, and I will continue to be a
good role model. It's devastating to me and my family, but life goes on."

Coach Tom Coughlin said Smith told him he did not take cocaine.

"This is a person I've had a long relationship with," Coughlin said. "He
looks me in the eye and tells me he didn't do it, I'm going to believe it."

Smith passed two breath tests after he was stopped, but police took a urine
sample, which was sent to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement for
analysis.

Smith tested positive for cocaine, Assistant State Attorney John Guy said
Monday.

Guy said his office would not prosecute Smith for drunken driving because he
did not have a blood-alcohol level above the state's .08 limit. Smith also
will not be prosecuted on drug charges.

"He didn't have anything on his person when he was arrested," Guy said.
"There was only cocaine in his system, and for that I can't prosecute."

Smith, who has been to the last four Pro Bowls, was third in the AFC in
receptions with 70 this season -- one in which most people didn't think he
would play.

He had three abdominal operations in the off-season, lost about 20 pounds
and spent about a month in the hospital.

This is something that's been rumored for the last few days and looks like
the rumors had some merit behind them.   You'll have to wait to see how it
shakes out.   Tough news all the way around but it's still very unclear what
(if any) action the league will take.   More as we hear it.
