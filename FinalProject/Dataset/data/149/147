I am OK with your simplifications. There was indeed repetition. There is still some redundancy at the very end (Are forward markets irrelevant?). But I think it does not hurt.

I think the graph Mike included needs some further explanation. It is not self-explanatory.

As per my conversation with Christi this morning, I will NOT contact Larry Ruff until I hear from you guys.

 I understand that you will be discussing this paper with Doug Gilbert today. Please let me know if I can be of any help. I am availablt today and tomorrow.

Tks

I have added an executive summary, removed a repetitive argument on historical need for balanced schedules and retitled the section headings.
