All of our producers have cut us off, and I hate to try and get them in a deal with us because I don't know if they will get paid.  I would talk to Lee at BR, I know he is under water with the Canadian Hunter acquisition.  You would be a major star at Hanover, any interest?  I think I would talk to Kinder Morgan.  They have a lot of projects on the books, as well as Calpine.  They really need gas help.

Good Luck and stay in touch.

Mark,
Mark,
Hope all is well with you guys in Denver.  
I  hope you are able to continue to make deals and are not caught up in the unbelievable craziness here in Houston.  
I was looking for companies to approach about employment and Burlington Resources name came up.  I assume Lee Hanse is still with them. I was going to send him an e-mail with my resume.  Any thoughts about BR.
Thanks,
Andy
