Arctic Drilling Affected by Lower Natural Gas Prices
 
     The drilling industry ready for an active winter season on the 
tundra of Canada's far north, but low natural gas prices and a weak 
economy have lowered expectations of a boom time. Most companies such 
as Petro-Canada and Paramount Resources  are pressing ahead with 
exploration in the rugged Northwest Territories. Due to marshy 
conditions for the rest of the year, wells are drilled in winter when 
the ground freezes. Petro-Canada plans to drill three 9,840-foot deep 
wells in the Mackenzie Delta and Paramount intends to drill two wells 
farther south, near Fort Liard, below the Arctic Circle. The region 
could hold trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. In recent 
federally supervised land sales, producers committed to spending 
C$650 million on exploration over the next few years just in the 
Mackenzie Delta. But some wells in theYukon and the Northwest 
Territories' central Mackenzie Valley have been canceled or delayed 
by Canadian Natural Resources. But the troubled economy and the drop 
in prices from $10 per MMBtu last January are having an impact. Akita 
Drilling is keeping two new rigs in Alberta this winter and delaying 
the move of the C$18 million units to the Mackenzie Delta until later 
in 2002. Imperial Oil, Shell Canada and Conoco are studying building 
a C$3 billion pipeline to transport about a Bcf per day of Arctic 
volumes to southern Canada and the US.
