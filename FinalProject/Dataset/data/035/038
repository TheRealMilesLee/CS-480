Louise,

I am doing much better now. Most of pain and sour is gone. Maybe it is the effect of the medication I have taken. But, I feel a lot better. Next Thursday, I will have a checkup on my leg. Hopefully, my ruptured bone will recover soon. I am planning to come back the week after Labor Day.

Thanks

Zhiyong
