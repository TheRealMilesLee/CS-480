Dear:Sir /Madam, 

I understand quite well that this message will sound so strange to you but it is a very serious
 matter that we need to tackle together very urgent. Before i proceed further,Let me formally 
introduce myself to you .I am DR. WILLIAMS MUGABE, the first adopted son of president Robert 
Mugabe, the current Zimbabwean President. I am contacting you today for an urgent assistance 
to transfer into your account the sum of US$25,000.000.00(TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED 
STATES DOLLARS). I hope that you may be aware of the recent differences that is going on rigth 
now between my father and the opposition party in my country, this also brought about the 
commonwealth community sanctioning my father and freezing all his foreign account both in 
America and britain.This decision was carried out during the 4days commonwealth meeting 
that was held in malawi in a part of South East Africa recently. 

It will interest you to hear that i never supported my fathers treatment to the white 
zimbabwean citizens, and this has seriously brought about some personal misunderstanding 
between me and my father.I have been opposing him since the past five (5) years fighting 
so hard to see that he leaves the presidential seat after governing for the past 22 years 
On this account i disassociated myself from him and we do not have any thing in common 
right now.He even forced me to leave the country with immediate effect after receiving 
the sanction from the common wealth community, Although he thought that i am behind 
his delimma. In the year 1996 when i was in good term with my father, he gave me a 
treasure box containing the sum of US$25,000.000.00 (TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES 
DOLLARS) to deposite in a private security company in South Africa for safe keeping, so 
i did exactly as he instructed me without disclosing the actual content of the box to 
the security company,every documents was signed and documented in my names and details.
this money has been lying in the security company for the past 7 years.

Now that he sent me out on exile, i left zimbabwe to South Africa where i am currently 
seeking political assylum.My aim of travelling to South Africa was to claim the money and 
transfer it out of South Africa to any other country that will be safe for investment.

I am contacting you therefore on the account that you will support me with your foreign 
account and to come over to South Africa so that we can both claim the fund together, and 
then we can travel down to your country for proper investment of the fund.

I have visited the security company and made every neccessary enquiry concernig the fund 
and it is still intact in the security house.I will compensate you with 20% of the total 
sum (i.e US$5,000.000.00) and i have set aside another 5% (i.e US$1,250.000.00) for any 
expenses that may be incured during the transaction. Please this is a very confidential 
matter that needs utmost secrecy and confidentiality, so i am really pleading to you to 
try as much as possible to keep every aspect of this confidential. Please also do not 
reveal it to any one as my hope and futture solely depend on this money and if you are 
willing to work with me and assist me on this transaction,then do not hesitate to contact 
me immediately by sending me your TELEPHONE and FAX NUMBERS,and reply me through my e-mail 
address for us to carry on with the next step of the transaction.

Hoping to receive your positive response soonest. 

BEST REGARDS, 
DR. WILLIAMS MUGABE.
