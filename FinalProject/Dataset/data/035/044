Hey Mike
It will be handled however the EPA handles the allowance, emissions and the ownership data.  If the EPA shows each company as two separate entities then the SO2 program will do the same.  If we write code to handle this on our own, luck would have it that the EPA will start reporting the two companies together.  It would probably be best for you to give them a call and inquire about how they normally handle this situation.

Wade,

On the SO2 Model, if there is an merger or acquisition, does the companies SO2 positions roll together.  For example, I am being told that Carolina Power & Light Co. was acquired by Progress Energy.  They should only show one position under Progress Energy.  

Please advise,
Mike
