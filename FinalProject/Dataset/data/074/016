MRS PAMELA WELSH
54 RAMSFORT HOUSE,
MANOR ESTATE
LONDON.
W5N 0AD
Dear Friend,

PLEASE UTILIZE THE FUNDS FOR HUMANITARIAN PURPOSE.

I am the above named person from LONDON. I am married to MR PATRICK GERALD WELSH who worked with BRITISH HIGH COMMISSION CANADA for nine years before he died in the year 1999. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that
lasted for only four days.

Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home.
When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of£7.5 Million
(seven Million five hundred thousand pound sterling)with an OFFSHORE
BANK here in UK.Presently, this money is still under the safe keeping
of the BANK.

Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last
for the next SEVEN months due to my cancer problems.
Though what disturbs me most is my stroke .Having known my condition,
I decided to donate this fund to church or
better still a christian individual That will utilize this
money the way I am going toinstruct here in. I want a
church that will use this fund on, orphanages and widows
propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of
God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that
Blessed is the hand that giveth.

  I took this decision because I don't have any child that will
inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I
don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by
unbelievers and  in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking
this bold decision.
I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I
know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. I know
that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace.
I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my
health. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your
reply I forward your personal information to my husband's Attorney in
London who will contact the BANK and introduce you as the legal owner
of this fund before transfering the fund into your nominated Bank
Account in your country.

You will be issued a letter of authority by him that will
empower you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I
want you and the church to always pray for me because the
lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life of
a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord
must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always
beprayerful all through your any delay in your reply will
give me room in sourcing for a church or christian
individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you
will act accordingly as I stated herein.

Your response should be channeled to my alternate email account at
(pamelawelsh22@netscape.net).

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.

Yours in Christ,

Mrs Pamela Welsh.
