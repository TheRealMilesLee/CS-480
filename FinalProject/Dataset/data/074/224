Dear Lawrence,

We have recently been provided with your email address.  Stanford Business
School Alumni Association offers all alumni personal, "GSB alumni email "
forwarding addresses. To improve communication with you and your classmates,
we have activated your GSB email forwarding account to the email address

your most current address.

Your GSB alumni email address is:

Forwarding to:   whalley@enron.com

To access GSB Online Services:

*******************

Guidelines for using the GSB Mail Groups:

1) JOB POSTINGS SHOULD ONLY GO TO THE JOBINFO@ALUMNI-GSB.STANFORD.EDU
DISTRIBUTION LIST AND YOUR CLASS LIST ONLY.  There are currently 1,583
people on the job info distribution list with a heavy amount of overlap to
HiTech and Bay Area.  PLEASE DO NOT SEND JOB POSTINGS TO HITECH AND BAYAREA.
 
2) WE HAVE SET UP A MAIL GROUP FOR BUSINESS ANNOUNCEMENTS listed under
Alumni-Business News on the list of mailgroups
(gsbbiznews@alumni-gsb.stanford.edu).  In general, other lists are not for
announcements such as "We've just launched a new business, please check us
out on the Web Site" or "If anyone is looking for an OB Consultant, please
call me".  However, many folks have expressed an interest in continuing to
receive these announcements.  You may subscribe to this list on the web
site.  Industry specific lists are great for "I'm looking for a resource
for..... does anyone have an idea" and public service kind of announcements
(e.g. speakers, etc.), but NOT appropriate for commercial announcements.

3) CLASS MAIL GROUPS CAN DETERMINE THEIR OWN CODE OF CONDUCT.  Presumably
you know everyone on your class distribution list and you can all battle it
out amongst yourselves as to what is appropriate for your list.  If you get
into fist fights, give us a call and we'll hire a consultant. :-)

4) DO NOT GIVE OUT THE MAIL GROUP ADDRESSES TO ANYONE OTHER THAN A STANFORD
GSB GRAD. We ask that you only send information to the mail groups that
service you directly, not friends and family.

 ***** The JobInfo, All Alumni, BayArea, Venture Capital, Entrepreneurs, Hi
Tech, Internet, Real Estate, San Francisco, and Peninsula lists are now
moderated lists, and it may take 24-48 hours before your message is posted.
This is because the listmistress reviews each message and determines whether
it is appropriate before posting it.  This is done to prevent you from
receiving a high volume of unwanted e-mail.
