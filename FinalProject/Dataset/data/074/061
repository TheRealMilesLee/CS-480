no need to eliminate specialization but there is a huge amount of duplication.. (for the record i am not weaseling my way into the chief fundamentalist role)..i think the specialization could remain but teh information should be commonly housed and centrallly disseminated) For example, why dio we need 4 stack models..it would be better to concentrate our effort and knowledge on making on great one
also in terms of headcount, elimination of  dupplication means reduced costs....do we really need to be hiring 100 analysts a year.......? where are we going to  put them all
let's keep the strongest and ditch the rest
