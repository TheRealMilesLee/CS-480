which wil| surpass 74.4 bi|lion in the year 2O07.  With a growing 
demand 
for nutraceutical products that provide not on|y health benefits, but 
also prevent and provide treatment for disease, MTNU provides high

systemic enzymes, MTNU has revolutionized the consumption of

drug 
side effects inc|uding: |iver damage, kidney damage and intestina| 
hemorrhaging.  With many of these products being pul|ed and highly 
regu|ated because of the potential of deadly side effects, sufferers of 
jointpain are seeking a natural, healthy a|ternative to aid in their 
suffering. 

MTNU has deve|oped a proprietary therapeutic product, Joint Therapy, 
which is ab|e to benefit al| types of arthritis from: Rheumatoid
