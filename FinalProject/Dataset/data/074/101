I am aware of the transaction and agree the account should be established.  After the securities are settled, I strongly suggest we close the account and will follow up to make sure that happens.  Donna

This request to open a brokerage account is in connection with ENA's sale of Hanover Compressor Company Common Stock .  The transaction involves several components.  We are being asked to open a brokerage account with Bear Stearns International Limited so that Bear is able to obtain favorable tax treatment on the specific types of transactions that we are doing.  We are attempting to enter into these transactions on a "one-off" basis to avoid negotiating a brokerage agreement that would govern any future transactions.

Gil:

Before any brokerage account can be opened, you need to advise the RAC group.  Please send an email to the three persons ("Cc") above explaining what accounts Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") requires and the purpose of those accounts (if you have not already done so).  ENA has a brokerage agreement with Bear Stearns Compamies, Inc. but not with Bear Stearns International Limited.  ENA already has resolutions for opening brokerage accounts.
