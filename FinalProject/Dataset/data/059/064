Company Business Strategy <br>
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\<br>
<br>
Having unrelated businesses, such as baby care products and computer hardware, provides the company benefits of diversification. Each business division is expected to serve different objective within the overall twin objectives of growth and profitability. The baby care product segment has a comparatively higher margin, where as the computer product division provides a higher revenue base for the organization. <br>
<br>
Strategy for Baby Care Products<br>
<br>
The baby care products and services is a $40 billion market annually. In Canada the Company has a 25% market share in baby care products market, where it competes with companies such as Avent, Gerbers, Safety First. The strategy for competing is to focus on a niche product, which is manufactured locally, thus reducing production lead-time.<br>
<br>
Company’s sales and marketing plan is to increase representation and sales growth through retail locations. This would entail increasing their market share in North America and providing products to international markets such as Europe, South America and other emerging markets, at the most economical price. In addition, the company has plans to increase market penetration through web based representation of newly sourced products. It also plans to continue growth inorganically through the acquisitions and alliances route for which it is in negotiations with targets in related businesses. <br>
<br>
Strategy for Computer Products<br>
<br>
Compuquest’s sales and marketing strategies have been based on specific target markets. They have established a dedicated sales force composed of three full time sales representatives and two independent sales representatives, working solely on commission for the computer division. Compuquest has developed an extensive telemarketing program, consisting of telemarketing sales personnel located in Toronto to target financial, graphics, utility, and education sectors throughout North America.<br>
<br>
Computer product division is providing high volume business for On the Go. However, margins are expected to range from 4 to 18 percent depending on the profile of the client. It plans to grow by building on the successful relationships with its clients and by becoming a quick reactionary supplier by harnessing on its leaner design to offer emergency services across North America. <br>
<br>
Sustained growth in Quarterly Results<br>

The company’s operating cash flow has been positive with a net inflow of $3872 prior to amortization of $23,824. The higher Selling, General and Administrative expenses of $103,987 are offset by the increase in gross profit. On the Go has been investing in marketing research, infrastructure and its website to position the company for expansion and growth. The trends in revenues for the last five quarters provides strong base for the companies’ ambitious growth plans.<br>
