In the wake of last week's disaster, we have had numerous requests for
contingency decisions on issues of a trading practice nature. We are
compiling a list of these questions for review by ISDA's Trading Practice
Committee, chaired by Jonathan Moulds at Bank of America.

If your firm has experienced or if you are aware of any such issues in
relation to the market disruptions (eg: how to establish CMS/CMT rates for
those days), please would you be prepared to raise them at tomorrow's Board
Meeting. If necessary, ISDA may subsequently ask its Trading Practice
Advisory Group to convene to address these issues.
