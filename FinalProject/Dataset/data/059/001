Gerald,

Here is the revised contract. Torch is going to do one final review today and get back with us. If they are satisfied with the contract, they will sign it today or tomorrow.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Judy

Wayne,

Attached are the redline contracts including the modification to the GTC article 2. Per our earlier conversation, I have inserted "Seller's Daily Deliverablity" as the amount that must be scheduled or the contract is in default. Please let myself or John Grass know if you have any further concerns.

Thanks,
Judy Thorne
