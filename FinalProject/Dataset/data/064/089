I have asked some of the originators to supply me with information re: EES approaching their customers. So far, I have received the following, all of which have occurred within the last few months:

1) Citgo Refining - Last month, we provided pricing for a facility in IL.  The customer indicated he already had a non-competitive bid from EES. 
2) AE Staley - the customer indicated he had recently been dealing with a representative from Enron Direct.  This was rectified when the rep left Enron last month.
3) Dow, Air Products, Praxair - EES spoke to them about a put option.
4) Abitibi, Shintech, Alcoa, Solutia, Kinder Morgan have all been approached by EES.
