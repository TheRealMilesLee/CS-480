Dear Sir,

 

I am an importer/exporter base in South Africa, who exports raw materials, such as Calcite, Barytes, Manganese Dioxide, Dolomite, Mica, China Clay, and Manganese Dioxide, Ferrous (Iron) Oxide, Paints, Rubber, Plastics, Construction chemicals and export  from  Asia and export into Europe, America and Australia.

 

My company was established in 2001. I am interested in employing your services, to work with me as my private payment agent who can help me establish a medium of receiving  payment on my behalf for goods and raw materials I supplied to my customers in Europe, America or Australia,  as I am already experiencing difficulties in receiving my payments from clients.

 

If you are interested in transacting business with me, I will be very glad and grateful to have you as my partner in business. Subject to your satisfaction you will be given the opportunity to negotiate your mode of which we will pay for your services as my representative in Europe, America and Australia. Please if you are interested forward to me your phone/fax number and your full contact address to my private e-mail address :

j_bruno8@excite.com 

 

I will be informing Jonathan R. Lloyd to whom I am personal assistant of your good intentions.

 

Thank you as I await your further response.

 

Faithfully Yours,

 

John Bruno
