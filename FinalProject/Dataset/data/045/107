Dear Students,

We are excited to announce that the First Annual Corporate Sponsors 
Reception will be held here at the Haas School of Business on Tuesday, 
October 2, 2001 from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM.

We invite you all to attend and to extend invitations to two managers in 
your organization who have made your studies possible through the provision 
of resources, time, and their enthusiastic support.

We recognize that many of you have class that evening and that your 
managers have busy schedules.  As such, we have developed a two-part 
program for the evening that we hope will accommodate schedules and, 
additionally, provide for your colleagues an evening at Haas that simulates 
your own experience:

      From 6:30 to 7:30 PM, two Haas faculty will give a seminar in Arthur 
Andersen Auditorium on current topics; and from 7:30 to 8:30 PM, a 
reception will be hosted in the Bank of America Forum.  You and your 
managers are invited to attend either or both halves of the evening.

We do request that you RSVP for this event and specify what portion of the 
evening you and your guests will be attending.

We will have printed invitations for you to distribute to your 
managers.  We anticipate that they will be in the program office for you to 
pick up during the week of September 17.

The Evening Program, and the Haas School as a whole, is excited to welcome 
your managers to the campus.
