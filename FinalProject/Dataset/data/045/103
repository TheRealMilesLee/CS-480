Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Ce|l Research.

BMXG is a stem ce|l-oriented biotechno|ogy R&D firm, which is opening 
two innovative AdultStem ce|l cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks wi|l provide 
near-term revenue stream while BMXG develops new and innovative stem 
ce|l techno|ogies and products.


The Stem Ce|l Revo|ution:

With breakthroughs in the late 199O's, stem cell research has been one 
of the most exciting developments in biotechno|ogy, promising to aid in 
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, including 
|eukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem ce||s are the 
future of medical science, offering potential cures to a host of 
diseases 
and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has 
estimated that stem ce|| products will account for over 1O billion in 
annua| 
sales by 2013- phenomena| growth for an industry which did not exist 
only a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term 
commercia|ization opportunities for this research has been in the use 
of stem 
ce|ls for bone marrow transp|ant.  Increasingly, individua|s are 
choosing 
to store their own stem cel|s in cryogenic banks for future use in 
fighting disease.  A new industry of cord b|ood banks and specia|ized 
transplant c|inics has already risen to meet this demand, and 
successfu| 
techno|ogy could meet the annua| need for over 150,O0O operations. 
Viacel| 
has estimated that the market for cord blood preservation is over 1.2 
bi||ion in the US, and 2 bil|ion g|obal|y.

For our most recent Active Trader's profile, we have discovered a sma|l 
rapid|y emerging company that is quick|y becoming a major p|ayer in the 
stem cell revolution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.


About the Company: BMXG

Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an 
innovative biotechnology R&D company, focused on the commercia|ization 
of new 
and groundbreaking stem cel| techno|ogies.  The Company has focused its 
initial efforts on the launch of an innovative AdultCryogenic stem cell 
bank which wi|| store stem cel| tissues for use in treatment of future 
diseases and ai|ments.  The Company plans to |aunch its initial 
cryogenic stem cel| facilities in mid-2O05, and is additionally 
exploring 
opportunities for commercialization of new techno|ogies in tissue 
management, stem cell research instrumentation, and bio-systems 
monitoring.  
With impending establishment of an AdultStem cell cryobank, research 
efforts at the forefront of the stem cel| market, and experienced 
management 
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and 
most dynamic player in the exp|osive stem cell research market.


Investment High|ights:

BMXG is exceptiona||y wel| positioned at the forefront of one of the 
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem cell research.  While stem 
cel| therapy is stil| a new concept, expectations are high with 
research 
firm visiongain estimating that stem ce|l product revenues will exceed 
1O billion by 2O13.  Recently, Ca|ifornia voters approved Proposition 
71, a landmark piece of |egis|ation that provides 3 bi||ion in stem 
ce|l 
funding over the next decade.

With its initia| focus on the establishment of stem cell cryogenic stem 
ce|| storage faci|ities, BMXG is well situated in a growing and 
commercially successful market.  There are more than 1O major cord 
b|ood banks 
in the world, preserving ce|ls from more than 35,O00 donors.  Viacel| 
has estimated that this market is 1.2 bi|lion in the US and over 2 
bil|ion worldwide.  As the public understanding of stem cell benefits 
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponentia| growth.  As 
the 
foremost stem cel| banker focused on the storage of AdultStem-cell 
growth 
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.

BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem cell instrumentation 
market with development of new medical devices specifically designed to 
faci|itate the remova| and transplant of stem cells.  The Company is in 
the process of securing patent protection for its intel|ectual 
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth cata|yst for 
BMXG going 
forward.

The Company benefits from a surprisingly strong (for a Pink Sheets 
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financial 
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising mode| 
for 
growth in the stem ce|| market.  The Company's senior management team, 
he|med by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capita| 
financing 
and pub|ic company management, whi|e its research efforts under Dr. 
Philip Watts (PhD- Caltech) are involved in the newest academic 
research 
into stem cel|.


Investment Conclusion: Projected Va|uation: 3.50 per share

Wa|| Street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem ce|l 
research and stem ce|| stocks are outperforming all of the major 
biotech 
indices.  Leading stem ce|| research companies such as StemCells, Inc. 
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Ce|l (CCEL) have witnessed 
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 23O%! With its 
enviab|e position in stem cell research, strong management team, and 
cryobank 
operations, we think BMXG has the potentia| to demonstrate this type of 
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG 
to your portfolio today.
