Tim,

It appears that they are following their "adjusted" formula almost exactly as we had calculated it a couple of weeks ago.  The spreadsheet I put together shows PG&E's Adjusted CTC for the months of Jun, Jul, and Aug (the time period in which >96% of the volumes appear) to be $23.13, $25.41, and $23.79 respectively.  The average of these three?  $24.11 !!!  (Okay, it's a simple average, not weighted, but we are certainly well within the ballpark.)
