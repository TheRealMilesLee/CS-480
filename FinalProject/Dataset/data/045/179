	Just got done talking with Corry, and Deal Scheduling showing the incorrect status of a physical routed flag is an issue. Corry will proceed and test against pwrtestp on Monday, no production rollouts will occur at this time.  
	Since we do have a major database migration process this weekend, our DBA's are currently tied up and our requests for production updates to the database have been slightly postponed till next week.

I had no idea that Corry was requesting the move to production yet.  I feel like the communication has been very one sided FROM me lately.

Won't the lack of proper flagging of physical paths in Deal Scheduling have an impact in the East?

Cara et all ,

	Deal Scheduling is what we are currently waiting on [physical routes issue], and the fix for it will probably take a couple of days till release. 

	Corry's request to move Path Confirmation to production by Friday COB can be scheduled pending database change requests which have been requested to allow for them. Upon approval the move for Preschedule Workspace to production can be done by Friday COB also? Cara is still testing the application and we will wait for her approval ..

Cara,	

	Thanks for stepping me through Deal Scheduling to see exactly what the problem was in regards to the Physical/Non-Physical issue.  Addressed this issue and we have someone currently looking at this issue and will try and get this kicked out asap. The two other apps are in stage and the schedules for our test date have been erased.. I will notify you immediately once we have Deal Scheduling's issue resolved.

thanks

Cara et all, 

	Following list of bug fixes are moving out to stage to address the recently reported issues: 

	New versions of both applications have been moved out to stage..


PreSchedule Workspace:
#1
Problem:
Uploading to the Path Confirm Area:*accepted Mid C-1:53   Rockies-0:22    Palo 1:11  COB 0:49 (Row 69 Generated a General SQL error message) 
This is showing Physical and non-physical right.

Solution:
Line 69 , the timezone value under column G was '6/20/2001-6/20/2001' when it should have been 'PDT' or any other valid timezone value.


#2
Problem:
Running Build Route Report:
	Criteria Selection-unable to select criteria for build route, got "List index out of bounds (4)" error *needs fix

Solution:
Fixed.. was losing track of which workspace was open

#3
Problem:
Daily Summary Function
*needs fix or workaround-Would not work at all, got 3 error messages. " Unable to locate" "can't find last row!", and "Failed to export summary!" this is going to create a csv file right to the AGG sched vol report now according to Mr. Poston, I am thrilled to hear it.

Solution:
Executive Report was just pushed to stage yesterday, the data is currently what we're focusing on with this release and will soon start shaping it to make it visualy look like the pre-existing excel-based Executive Report.

#4
Problem:
Error Checking - took 1:29, produced a line by line error sheet that is printable, *accepted
	BUT routing errors for lines 19-223 in the COB sheet produced a routing error that just states "ERROR:" no reason.  We need to know why an error is shown(was 	run after all routes were deleted) *needs fix

Solution:
Error Checking will not spit out any errors if there aren't any.



Path Confirmation:


#1
Problem:
One little housekeeping thing,  can we move the delete button away from the confirm button?  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button?  This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion?

Solution:
Dialog box included for deletion alert confirmation purposes and button repositioned.

Routing
Mid C-13:27   Rockies-2:23   Palo 7:56  COB 5:12 the time is fine.

**needs fix**The routes are still not showing designated Physical or Non-Physical Properly. All are coming through as Non-Physical.  This is must be fixed prior to release for production as our WSCC fee pulls directly from this data in deal Scheduling.


Path Confirmation:

Speed is very much an issue here,  I had Mark Guzman sit with me while I cut a path and when I confirmed a group of paths. The confirmation of 5 paths as a group took 70 seconds from the time I entered the name and hit the "ok" button until the confriming was completed. This is too long, we need this to be 20-30 seconds max. Currently, this process takes about 10 seconds in lotus. Confriming 2 paths with the 20th fully populated took 1:39.

Cutting a path went fast enough until I closed the screen to go back to the confirmation report. This also took over a minute.  This is another 10 second process in lotus.

One little housekeeping thing,  can we move the delete button away from the confirm button?  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button?  This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion?

All of the sorting looks great, the paths are represented properly, we are very very close!


Real Time Discussion:

Where are we on this?  I heard initial rumblings, but nothing lately.

Here are the sheets that I have used to create data for 6/20

 << File: COB_JUNE20_USEME.psc >>  << File: Mid_C_June20.psc >>  << File: Palo_June20.psc >>  << File: Rockies_June_20.psc >> 

I can do more testing or Net meeting stuff tomorrow until about 10:30, but after that I have to be a scheduler for a couple of hours.

Thanks,

Cara
