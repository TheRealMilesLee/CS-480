I need your help in getting this effort started.    I don't know what the
probability is of actually doing what they have in mind as a finalg oal, but
after a discussion with them yesterday, I am convinced there may be some
potential value in the study they propose, as to our goodwill issues.    If
they can get a larger value from their study for plant purposes than we
currently have and they suggest that may be a goal of the study, it will
help us along towards our goal.    I don't know what the potential is for
success, but if they want to do a study and it potentially can help us, I
think it's worth a shot.

 Rod: 

I am following up on our recent meeting concerning Project Hitchcock.  We
have made good progress on a number of the issues, and believe it now makes
sense to get the following stepsu nderway:

1.	

	 Meet with Keith Harris (and other appropriate Wessex management) to
provide an overview of the project, its benefits, and the steps required to
implement.  
2.	Initiate a property cost-segment study, which will be required to
determine more precisely the available U.S. tax depreciation.

As you would expect, we will need some additional assistance from Wessex if
we are to make this project work.  We continue to work ons everal other
issues in parallel, but feel that it makes sense at this point to get the
two highlighted steps underway.

 Would you please offer your advice as to the best method for moving
forward?

 Regards,

         Dave
