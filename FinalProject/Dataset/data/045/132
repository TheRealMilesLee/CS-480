Welcome back all of you veteran pickers!  I’d like to introduce our three
new rookies:

The Deitrick’s - Val and Scott - from napa
Andy Bledsoe - from Napa
Kent Deverell - from San Francisco

Good luck to all!!

Steve McCarthy is not in the pool this year (we'll miss his bazaar picks)
and we aren't sure if Carlton is still in.  If he is, we'll have a total of
27; if not it'll be 26.  We'll send out a completed report of the projected
payouts before the first week of the season starts.

Attached are two Excel files.  The first one just has the pick sheet for
week #1


One easy way to submit the weekly picks is to:
1)	Click on this sheet and open it in Excel
2)	Fill in the information at the top
3)	Make your weekly picks by putting numbers in the cell with the line under
it by the team you want to pick.  (This will also give you a check figure at
the bottom to be sure you have gotten, at least,  the correct total - not
necessarily the WINNING numbers, however!)
4)	Save and close the file
5)	Use "FORWARD" to get the e-mail back to me at eldon@direcpc.com
6)	If you use "REPLY" the attachment does not get sent

It really makes a huge difference in the amount of time it takes to do the
statistical work if you use this form so we really appreciate getting your
picks this way.

Here is an Excel workbook that contains a tab for every week - so all 17
weeks are here plus a sample.  However, all you need to send back is the
sheet for the current week.  Just to make it easier, (or in case you've
misplaced the attachment) we'll send out, via e-mail, each upcoming week's
pick sheet in time for you to make your selections.   If you have any
questions about Excel please give me a call at (707) 255-4813 or call Nancy
at (707) 251-4870.
