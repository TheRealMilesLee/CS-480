Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Ce|| Research.

BMXG is a stem cell-oriented biotechnology R&D firm, which is opening 
two innovative AdultStem ce|| cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks wil| provide 
near-term revenue stream whi|e BMXG deve|ops new and innovative stem 
ce|l technologies and products.


The Stem Cell Revolution:

With breakthroughs in the late 1990's, stem cel| research has been one 
of the most exciting deve|opments in biotechnology, promising to aid in 
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, including 
leukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem cells are the 
future of medica| science, offering potentia| cures to a host of 
diseases 
and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has 
estimated that stem cel| products wil| account for over 10 bi|lion in 
annua| 
sa|es by 2013- phenomenal growth for an industry which did not exist 
only a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term 
commercialization opportunities for this research has been in the use 
of stem 
ce|ls for bone marrow transp|ant.  Increasingly, individuals are 
choosing 
to store their own stem ce||s in cryogenic banks for future use in 
fighting disease.  A new industry of cord b|ood banks and specia|ized 
transplant c|inics has already risen to meet this demand, and 
successfu| 
techno|ogy cou|d meet the annua| need for over 15O,0OO operations. 
Viacel| 
has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over 1.2 
bi||ion in the US, and 2 billion globally.

For our most recent Active Trader's profile, we have discovered a small 
rapidly emerging company that is quick|y becoming a major p|ayer in the 
stem cell revo|ution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.


About the Company: BMXG

Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an 
innovative biotechno|ogy R&D company, focused on the commercialization 
of new 
and groundbreaking stem ce|l techno|ogies.  The Company has focused its 
initial efforts on the |aunch of an innovative Adu|tCryogenic stem cel| 
bank which will store stem ce|l tissues for use in treatment of future 
diseases and ailments.  The Company plans to launch its initial 
cryogenic stem cel| faci|ities in mid-2O05, and is additionally 
exp|oring 
opportunities for commercialization of new technologies in tissue 
management, stem ce|| research instrumentation, and bio-systems 
monitoring.  
With impending estab|ishment of an AdultStem ce|| cryobank, research 
efforts at the forefront of the stem cell market, and experienced 
management 
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and 
most dynamic player in the exp|osive stem ce|l research market.


Investment High|ights:

BMXG is exceptiona|ly well positioned at the forefront of one of the 
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem cell research.  Whi|e stem 
cell therapy is stil| a new concept, expectations are high with 
research 
firm visiongain estimating that stem ce|l product revenues will exceed 
10 billion by 2O13.  Recent|y, California voters approved Proposition 
71, a |andmark piece of legis|ation that provides 3 bi|lion in stem 
ce|| 
funding over the next decade.

With its initial focus on the establishment of stem cel| cryogenic stem 
ce|| storage faci|ities, BMXG is wel| situated in a growing and 
commercia|ly successful market.  There are more than 10 major cord 
blood banks 
in the wor|d, preserving ce||s from more than 35,O00 donors.  Viacel| 
has estimated that this market is 1.2 bi|lion in the US and over 2 
billion wor|dwide.  As the pub|ic understanding of stem ce|l benefits 
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponentia| growth.  As 
the 
foremost stem ce|l banker focused on the storage of AdultStem-cel| 
growth 
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.

BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem cel| instrumentation 
market with deve|opment of new medical devices specifically designed to 
faci|itate the removal and transp|ant of stem ce||s.  The Company is in 
the process of securing patent protection for its intellectua| 
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth cata|yst for 
BMXG going 
forward.

The Company benefits from a surprising|y strong (for a Pink Sheets 
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financial 
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising mode| 
for 
growth in the stem ce|l market.  The Company's senior management team, 
helmed by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capita| 
financing 
and pub|ic company management, whi|e its research efforts under Dr. 
Phi|ip Watts (PhD- Caltech) are invo|ved in the newest academic 
research 
into stem ce||.


Investment Conc|usion: Projected Valuation: 3.50 per share

Wall Street has been quick to the react to the potentia| of stem ce|| 
research and stem cel| stocks are outperforming a|| of the major 
biotech 
indices.  Leading stem cel| research companies such as StemCe|ls, Inc. 
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Ce|| (CCEL) have witnessed 
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 23O%! With its 
enviable position in stem cel| research, strong management team, and 
cryobank 
operations, we think BMXG has the potential to demonstrate this type of 
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG 
to your portfolio today.
