 Dear Sir,
 I hope that this letter will not constitute a sort of embarrasement 
to
 you. Please bear with me let me introduce myself.
 I am barrister Rapheal Akias a private attorney to the deceased as
 mentioned herein. Mr.Daniel Figueiras, who was a consultant with
 Shell-development Company in Nigeria and a personal friend, He died 
and
 left behind a hugh amount deposited in a finance house(GLOBAL CITI
 TRUST SECURITY COMPANY ) valued at $7,753,000.00(Seven Million Seve! 
n
 Hundredand Fifty Three Thousand United States Dollars Only).
 My relationship with Mr.Danie started in 1992 when I was working with
 the security company as a supervisor, Marina branch. We met in my
 social
 club's annual end of the year party and I introduced him to the said
 security company where he deposit most of his treasures some few 
weeks
 later, making me the LEGAL officer to the account which he operated
 until his unfortunate demise. On the 1st of June 2001, Mr. Danie , 
his
 wife and their three children were involved in a car accident . All
 occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I
 have made several enquiries to locate any of Mr.Danie's extended
 relatives this has also proved unsuccessful.
 After these several unsuccessful attempts, to locate any member of 
his
 family hence I contacted you. I am contacting you to assist in
 ! repatriating the money left behind by Mr. Danie before they get
 ; confiscated since the SECURITY COMPANY has declared the account
 unserviceable. I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for
 over 2 years since I was retired as a Senior Manager from a transfer
 that took me to another branch of the bank. I therefore seek your
 consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased, so that 
the
 proceeds of this account valued at $7,753,000.00 (Seven Million Seven
 Hundred and Fifty Three Thousand United States Dollars Only) can be
 paid
 to you and then you and I can share the money. 70% for me and 30% to
 you. I have access to all necessary legal documents that can be used 
to
 back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest 
cooperation
 to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be
 executed under a legitimate a
 rrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.
 Please send to me you! r full name and private telephone and fax 
numbers
 to enable us discuss further about this transaction.You can also
 contact
 me through my
 email address;barr_akias_chambers@cashette.com

 Anticipating your soonest co-operation.
