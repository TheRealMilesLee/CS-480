When Rob became interested in electricity his clear-headed father
considered the boy's fancy to be instructive as well as amusing; so he
heartily encouraged his son, and Rob never lacked batteries, motors or
supplies of any sort that his experiments might require. He fitted up the
little back room in the attic as his workshop, and from thence a net-work of
wires soon ran throughout the house<BR>
Not only had every outside door its electric bell, but every window was
fitted with a burglar alarm; moreover no one could cross the threshold of
any interior room without registering the fact in Rob's workshop. The gas
was lighted by an electric fob; a chime, connected with an erratic clock in
the boy's room, woke the servants at all hours of the night and caused the
cook to give warning; a bell rang whenever the postman dropped a letter into
the box; there were bells, bells, bells everywhere, ringing at the right
time, the wrong time and all the time<BR>
<BR>
And there were telephones in the different rooms, too, through which Rob
could call up the different members of the family just when they did not
wish to be disturbed. His mother and sisters soon came to vote the boy's
scientific craze a nuisance; but his father was delighted with these
evidences of Rob's skill as an electrician, and insisted that he be allowed
perfect freedom in carrying out his ideas.
