Hard as it is to believe, we do not really know where the TW lines are within the ROW.
Best we can tell,  a centerline survey of the easement was done proir to construction, and the line/lines were installed somewhere within the easement width..
Bottom line is no offsets from edges of the ROW appear to be available to identify the exact locations, and only completing a field survey will tell us the exact location of the lines.
I don't think these costs are warranted at this stage. Do you agree?
 
The San Juan Lateral  has 1 - 30" line in it and typically has a 50" average ROW width.
The TW Mainline has 2- 30" lines in it ( with a 50' separation between them) and the ROW width varies from 75' to 120'.
 
Hopefully, next weeks field trip will allow me to try and peg the location in a few spots down.
