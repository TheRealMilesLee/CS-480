He was convinced I was too young to take this seriously. "You're only 26. You're too young." He kept repeating my age as though he was convinced that the lumps (now at a total of 3) were a figment of his imagination and failing that, I was overreacting. By coming to the follow up I was told to? Now I'm suspicious. As doctors, drugs and treatments have all taught me in the past, cover your own ass. Do your own research. Get a second opinion, then a third and keep asking just in case. There is a difference between hypochondria and removing doctors from a pedestal they had no place being on.2</SPAN><strong>Can I let you in on a secret? </strong><SPAN style="display:none">Well, I knew it would happen and it has. The cat B got from her mom has latched on to me, and it is driving me crazy. Prissy will not leave our room for anything, yes she has only been there a week and it will take some time I know. BUT it is driving me a little nuts. If I go the the bathroom she goes to the bathroom, heck if I enter the room she is following me around when I get in bed she has to get in beside me and bugs me till I love on her. Now we have another cat Tuff, he is my cat and has been since he was born in our house, this has really upset him, they sat on the bed last night staring each other down and growling. Heck I hid under the covers afraid the claws might come out and I would be the scratching ground. Now Prissy has decided the only way to get from my dresser where she stay to the food which just happens to be on the other side of the bed is to come across the pillows, it doesn't matter if you are sleeping or not, I nearly killed her this morning when she jumped on my pillow and I was in a fight in my dream lets just say I need to vacuum the cat hair.6</SPAN></font></p>

I see people with no jobs, no careers, no futures and a sense of hopelessness crushing the fragile space where they once stored dreams. What is reality like for them? Can a middle-class white woman with very few problems and past traumas even understand? How long would it take for the world to distort if I were cold and alone. Totally. Bus stations, parks, malls, condemned buildings, fields, woods - places to sit, wait and move on. Nowhere to go or be. No one to talk to. Who would notice or care? Unless I got in the way by needing or wanting something, I could become invisible. And it's so hard to come back to the world. To get back in the flow of human traffic. 3</SPAN>
