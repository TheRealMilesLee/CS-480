HANG SENG BANK LTD.
DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,
CENTRAL HONG KONG,
HONK KONG.=20

=20
Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr Cheung Pui,
Director of operations Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have an=20
obscure business proposal for you.

Before the U.S led war on Iraqi, our client Major Fadi Bassem who=20
was with the Iraqi forces and also a businessman made a numbered fixed =
deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of twenty four millions fi=
ve hundred thousand United State Dollars in my branch. Upon maturity se=
veral notices were sent to him, even during the war earlier last year. =
Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response=
 came from him. We later found out that the Major and his family had be=
en killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home.

After further investigations it was also discovered that Major Fadi Bas=
em did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the=
 paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last ti=
me he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my =
bank.=20

As you can see, twenty four million five hundred thousand United State =
Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to =
claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the by-laws of my c=
ountry at the expiration of 3 years the funds will revert to the owners=
hip of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.=20=


Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as =
a=20
foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Bassem so that you =
will be able to receive his funds.=20

Modalities:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so=20
that we will come out successful. I have contacted an attorney
that will prepare the necessary documents that will back you up=20
as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem.All that is required from you at=
 this stage is for you to provide me with your full name and address so=
 that the attorney can commence his job, after you have been made the n=
ext of kin, the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf an=
d secure the necessary documentation for the move of the funds to an ac=
count that will be provided by you.

There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt=
 a=20
legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary docume=
nts.=20

Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning =
this issue.=20

Once the funds have been transferred, we shall share in the ratio of 70=
% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the cours=
e of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your priva=
te phone and fax numbers for easy communication, you can write me via t=
his private box: c_p246@yahoo.co.uk, and finally after that, I shall pr=
ovide you with more details of this operation.

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.




Kind Regards


Mr.Cheung Pui.
