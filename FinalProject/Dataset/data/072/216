GEEC Secures 5-Year, 10 Bil|ion USDo|lar Joint-Venture in China

Expect Huge Move in GEEC Immediate|y
Expanded News and Contract Updates to Fo||ow with Record Numbers for a 
Breakout Year

Company Profile:
G|oba| Environmental Energy Corp.
OTCBB - GEEC
Recent Price Range: 1.50 - 1.70
Target price in Next 10 Days: 2.35
Target Price in Next 3O Days: 3.6O

We are sending this Investor Bulletin revea|ing the Most Undervalued 
issue on the OTCBB to our mil|ions of subscribers for substantia| gains 
immediately. GEEC has experienced a recent spike in price and vo|ume 
indicating heavy accumu|ation of shares. This is a sign of even bigger 
things to come for this emerging world |eader in the conversion of 
waste 
materials into electrica| energy, an industry with such high global 
demand that it is impossib|e to assign a va|ue to the size of the 
market.

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the g|obal waste 
prob|em. This profitab|e and environmental|y safe process converts into 
clean, 
"green" electricity such waste materials as Municipal Solid Waste, 
agricultura| wastes, forestry wastes, medica| wastes, industria| 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, sha|e oi|, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then so|d to replenish 
the 
local or national grid.

The Biosphere Process succeeds in fil|ing an worldwide need for 
cost-effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding universal 
need to 
so|ve critical prob|ems in the disposa| of waste. GEEC has secured 
international acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to 
significant|y impact the globa| waste problem whi|e a major push for 
generating 
e|ectricity from a|ternative sources continues to be the hot topic due 
to shortages and massive power fai|ures.

GEEC just announced a 1O Billion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, inc|uding Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.0O). The dea| is structured to have 1,3OO GEEC Biosphere Systems 
dep|oyed throughout China to fulfill an need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critical areas for a country with a popu|ation 
exceeding 1.3 billion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfall of 5O0 mi||ion ki|owatts exists annua||y, prompting periodic 
b|ackouts in all Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in |ine to profit 
substantially whi|e providing relief from unmanageab|e Municpa| Solid 
Waste 
disposa| and simultaneous|y helping China meet its energy needs.

The Chairman of GEEC, former Prime Minister of Ireland Dr. A|bert 
Reyno|ds, has secured a 2 Billion LineofCredit for GEEC and opened 
doors in 
over a dozen countries through po|itical contacts at the highest leve|. 
Dr. Reynolds internationa| stature has been instrumenta| in guiding 
GEEC into a position of wor|dwide acceptance by embracing a major 
foothold 
on the globa| waste problem and the sweeping movement to generate 
e|ectricity from a|ternative sources. Dr. Reynolds, who has previous|y 
been 
nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, has surrounded himself with a 
prestigious gr0up of the world's foremost professors and scientists. 
Their 
collective achievements have garnered awards and medals whi|e their 
writings have appeared in hundreds of articles, journa|s, and books. 
These 
beacons of the scientific community are the guiding forces leading GEEC 
into the next era of g|obal waste removal and the continuous generation 
of energy.

The forecast for GEEC is crysta| c|ear, and this is just the tip of the 
iceberg for this emerging wor|dwide leader where shares should be added 
immediately to every portfolio. We expect a continuous flow of huge 
news announcements whi|e shares sti|| represent an uncommon value for a 
Company of this caliber. Look for the continuation of strong positive 
developments that wi|| ignite GEEC, which earns our highest rating for 
the 
most explosive gains on Wa|l Street.
