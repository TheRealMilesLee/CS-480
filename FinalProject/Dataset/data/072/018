Marine Investment Growth Alert 
Discovering the Most Profitable Investments in the Seas
****************************** 

Virtually untapped and barely known to even the most seasoned investment p=
rofessionals, this industry is quickly becoming the most vibrant and faste=
st growing segment of worldwide agriculture.

The answer is aquaculture, or fish farming, and it has quietly become the =
most dynamic segment of global agriculture, representing roughly 28=
% of all seafood production and producing annual revenues of $56 billion.
But why haven't I heard of it?
 
While aquaculture is huge internationally, it has been slow to find accept=
ance in the US.  But with increasing US consumption of seafood and overfis=
hing of natural stocks, this is all rapidly changing!! Aquaculture is the =
fastest growing segment of the US agriculture industry and is expected to =
reach $5 Billion over the next several years!!
*****
How can I get invosteve.keaned?
*****

We have discovered a small Florida-based company, trading for a little ove=
r a quarter per share, that is positioned to revolutionize the face of aqu=
aculture forever.
 
In the abandoned rock quarries of south Florida, this small company has sp=
ent more than five years developing eco-friendly aquaculture technologies =
that produce better quality seafood at lower cost and with faster producti=
on times.  This company is already utilizing these technologies, and has b=
ecome a major producer of striped bass and other popular seafood species. =


What is more, the company is diversifying its operations with independent =
wholesale, technology consulting, seafood processing, and value added prod=
ucts; the company is also expanding into Australia and the Pacific. With a=
 fully vertically-integrated business model, this company is well on-track=
 to become a leading US seafood conglomerate.

*****
The Aquaculture Explosion
*****

Since 1945, aquaculture has become an increasingly important component of =
global food production, representing the fastest growing segment of the wo=
rlds food economy with annual increases of more than 10% a year. 

With an increasing global population, seafood has supplanted many other fo=
rms of protein and sustenance as the primary source of caloric intake, wit=
h more than 1 billion people worldwide dependent on fish as their main sou=
rce of animal protein.  Worldwide fish consumption has risen from less tha=
n 40 million tons in 1970 to over 86 million tons in 1998.  As global cons=
umption has skyrocketed, the ability of natural stocks to sustain this con=
sumption has plummeted. 

Once considered an inexhaustible natural resource, the world=92s seafood i=
s faced with alarming over-fishing and environmental considerations.  Expe=
rts have predicted that by 2030, there will be a global 40 billion pounds =
per year seafood shortage.  Already, in many places, heavy fishing and env=
ironmental problems have forced governments to limit or halt fishing until=
 populations can recover. 

Many of the world=92s commercially important fish species are nearly gone,=
 replaced by species of much lower market value. 

These factors pose a direct and critical threat to the $250 billion global=
 seafood industry.  Aquaculture represents the only clear and attainable n=
ear-term solution for this supply gap.  Globally, aquaculture is a $56 bil=
lion industry, and represents roughly 28% of global seafood production- up=
 from only 3.9% in 1970.  

In spite of the tremendous and critical need for dramatic expansion of aqu=
aculture production, the US has been slow to implement aquaculture product=
ion efforts.  Total aquaculture production in the US represents only 1 bil=
lion pounds, or roughly 8% of total production.  This $1 billion US indust=
ry is expected to reach $5 billion within the next several years, accordin=
g to US government policy mandates.

At the same time, Americans demand for seafood has reached unprecedented h=
eights.  As consumers recognizes the health benefits that a diet high in s=
eafood with lean protein and heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, per capita=
 seafood consumption has increased by more than 50% since 1960, and is exp=
ected to reach 5.4 million tons by 2020.

The inability of wild-catch fish to meet increased demand has already crea=
ted skyrocketing prices and limited availability of many species.  The US =
is now the world=92s second largest importer of seafood behind Japan, and =
seafood imports are the second largest raw goods import, with $14 billion =
they are behind only oil in dollar value.
 
 
But there is some good news to this situation; the opportunity for savvvy =
traders to see their profits soar from early investment in the US aquacult=
ure industry is better now than it ever has been in the past.  We have fou=
nd one company, in particular, that we think has the potential to make you=
 rich:
 
Neptune Industries is a small Florida-based vertically-integrated producer=
 and distributor of seafood products that has been making big waves in the=
 aquaculture industry.  Neptune has spent more than five years developing =
and refining a series of innovative eco-friendly aquaculture technologies =
that will help make its product among the freshest and most flavorful on t=
he market, while reducing production time and costs.
The SAFE=99 System-  A Revolution in Aquaculture Technology
The core of Neptune's operations are its Solar-powered, Aquaculture, Finfi=
sh, Environment (S.A.F.E.) System- which is an innovative floating contain=
ment system, using solar power, solid waste removal, automated feeding sys=
tems, and advanced water circulation to create an ideal environemtnet fot =
the healthy and rapid growth of fish.  Including the Company's patent pend=
ing Eco-Tank=99 jointed, articulating tank which absorbs the imact of wave=
, wind, and current actions, the SAFE=99 System is truly revolutionary wit=
hin the industry, and will produce recurring revenue streams for the compa=
ny from licensing sales.  Neptune has recently signed a landmark joint ven=
ture agreement for licensing and implementation of this technology to aqua=
culture producers in the Asia-Pacific region.  Neptune has recently filed =
a provisional patent application for the SAFE=99  SYstem, which will provi=
de full protection of this technology in the US and abroad for the next ye=
ar, as the company files worldwide patent applications.
Pacific Expansion
Neptune just announced a joint venture agreement with South Pacific Aqua T=
echnologies, Ltd. of The Cook Islands.  South Pacific Aqua is a diversifie=
d fisheries company seeking to develop aquaculture operations in the Cook =
Islands, New Zealand, Australia, and Samoa.  Headed by the former Secretar=
y of Marine Resources for the Cook Islands, Neptune has secured the formal=
 support and endorsement of the Cook Islands' government.
 
Neptune could earn about $0.10 per share during 2005.  Other public compan=
ies in the aquaculture sector trade at price to earnings multiples of 25x,=
 or better.
Using only a P/E of 20x, shares of Neptune (NPNI) should be currently trad=
ing at $2.00 or more!!!
Neptune cannot keep up with the demand from its distributors and recently =
doubled its capacity to meet the demand.
Neptune expects to produce be up to 3 million lbs. of its striped bass pro=
duct next year. 
The Company is going to start selling its SAFE Systems this year, and is a=
lso aggressively pursuing acquisitions of US fish farms to build out its p=
roduction capacity.  We think that a $0.10 EP projection is extremely cons=
ervative!!
 
The $250 billion seafood industry is expanding far beyond the capacity of =
natural stocks to meet demand.  By 2030, there will be a global 40 billion=
 lbs. per year seafood shortage.

Aquaculture has emerged as a clear solution.  Well established worldwide, =
aquaculture is a $56 billion industry with production of 76 million tons, =
28% of total production.

As Americans turn to a healthy diet and consume more seafood, US aquacultu=
re is expected to grow to $5 billion from its current market size of $1 bi=
llion.

Neptune is becoming a fully vertically-integrated seafood production and d=
istribution company with its introduction of value-added seafood products,=
 wholesale seafood distribution, and license of its production technologie=
s.

The Company has developed the leading aquaculture technology on the market=
, its proprietary S.A.F.E.=99 System, which provides eco-friendly seafood =
production.  NPNI has just received worldwide patent-pending status, and i=
s filing additional patents for global markets.

Neptune has recently signed a JV agreement with South Pacific Aqua Technol=
ogies to license this technology to aquaculture operations and fisheries i=
n the South Pacific and Australia, and has received the support of the Coo=
k Islands government for implementing this technology in the country.

President & CEO Ernie Papodoyianis is an experienced marine biologist and =
aquaculture executive with more than 20 years spent operating and managing=
 aquaculture and fishery businesses.  NPNI recently added Robert Hipple as=
 CFO.  Mr. Hipple is a former Professor of Tax and Securities Law at Georg=
etown University and has served in senior manageent positions for a number=
 of large publicly traded companies.

Based on current production estimates, we expect Neptune to reach annual p=
roduction of more than 3.5 million pounds of seafood within the next twesteve.kean=
e months- representing revenues of over $7.8 million- before acquisitions!=
!!

Trading at just $0.26 per share, NPNI is extremely undervalued.  Based on =
production estimates, NPNI...should carry a valuation of at least $2.00 pe=
r share- a gain of nearly 800%!!
