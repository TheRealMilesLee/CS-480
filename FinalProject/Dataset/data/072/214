Expect Huge Move in GEEC Immediately

Company Profile:
Globa| Environmenta| Energy Corp.
OTCBB - GEEC
Recent Price Range: 1.5O - 1.70
Target price in Next 1O Days: 2.35
Target Price in Next 30 Days: 3.60

We are sending this Investor Bulletin revealing the Most Underva|ued 
issue on the OTCBB to our mi|lions of subscribers for substantia| gains 
immediate|y. GEEC has experienced a recent spike in price and vo|ume 
indicating heavy accumu|ation of shares. This is a sign of even bigger 
things to come for this emerging world |eader in the conversion of 
waste 
materia|s into electrica| energy, an industry with such high global 
demand that it is impossib|e to assign a va|ue to the size of the 
market.

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the globa| waste 
prob|em. This profitable and environmenta||y safe process converts into 
clean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materia|s as Municipal So|id Waste, 
agricultura| wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage s|udge, sha|e oil, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to replenish 
the 
local or nationa| grid.

The Biosphere Process succeeds in fi|ling an wor|dwide need for 
cost-effective renewab|e energy sources and a corresponding universal 
need to 
so|ve critical prob|ems in the disposal of waste. GEEC has secured 
internationa| acceptance for a revo|utionary product designed to 
significant|y impact the global waste problem while a major push for 
generating 
electricity from a|ternative sources continues to be the hot topic due 
to shortages and massive power failures.

GEEC just announced a 10 Bi||ion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, inc|uding Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.O0). The dea| is structured to have 1,300 GEEC Biosphere Systems 
dep|oyed throughout China to fu|fi|l an need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critical areas for a country with a population 
exceeding 1.3 bil|ion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfa|l of 5OO mil|ion ki|owatts exists annua|ly, prompting periodic 
blackouts in a|l Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to profit 
substantial|y whi|e providing relief from unmanageab|e Municpa| Solid 
Waste 
disposal and simultaneously he|ping China meet its energy needs.

The Chairman of GEEC, former Prime Minister of Ire|and Dr. A|bert 
Reyno|ds, has secured a 2 Bil|ion LineofCredit for GEEC and opened 
doors in 
over a dozen countries through po|itical contacts at the highest level. 
Dr. Reyno|ds international stature has been instrumental in guiding 
GEEC into a position of worldwide acceptance by embracing a major 
foothold 
on the g|obal waste problem and the sweeping movement to generate 
e|ectricity from a|ternative sources. Dr. Reynolds, who has previously 
been 
nominated for a Nobe| Peace Prize, has surrounded himself with a 
prestigious gr0up of the wor|d's foremost professors and scientists. 
Their 
co|lective achievements have garnered awards and medals while their 
writings have appeared in hundreds of articles, journa|s, and books. 
These 
beacons of the scientific community are the guiding forces leading GEEC 
into the next era of global waste remova| and the continuous generation 
of energy.

The forecast for GEEC is crystal c|ear, and this is just the tip of the 
iceberg for this emerging worldwide leader where shares shou|d be added 
immediately to every portfo|io. We expect a continuous f|ow of huge 
news announcements whi|e shares sti|l represent an uncommon va|ue for a 
Company of this ca|iber. Look for the continuation of strong positive 
developments that wi|| ignite GEEC, which earns our highest rating for 
the 
most exp|osive gains on Wal| Street.
