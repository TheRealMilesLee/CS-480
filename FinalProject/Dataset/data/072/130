brent puked it out pretty hard on friday...probably as good as it gets to sell this puppy

for your benefit make sure you get someone to go back and look closely at relative storage levels and prices levels for all btus in 1998
relationahips as you recall get bizarre on the lower end of the spectrum...it's a good couple of graphs to keep around


1- all stocks as a% full chart
2-btus equi chart
1vs2
1vs diffs in #2

If i could access this info i'd send it...but enron systems being what they are it takes hours to connnect to houston drive
