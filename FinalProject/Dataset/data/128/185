                               SMUD Cosumnes Power Plant Project
                                  Begins Energy Commission Review 


Sacramento - The Sacramento Municipal Utility District's Cosumnes Power Plant Project took its first step in the California
Energy Commission's review process today. Commissioners voted four to zero to accept the SMUD application as data
adequate. The finding means that Energy Commission staff has enough information to begin the 12-month licensing review of
the project.

If approved and built on the proposed site near the decommissioned Rancho Seco nuclear power plant, 25 miles south of
Sacramento, the Cosumnes Power Plant Project will produce 1,000 megawatts. The combined-cycle, natural gas-fired
generation facility would be constructed in two phases. Each phase would generate 500 megawatts and consist of two
combustion turbines, one condensing steam turbine and two heat-recovery steam generators. SMUD expects the total cost of the
plant to be $595 million.

SMUD hopes to begin construction on the plant by the end of 2002, with the first phase beginning operation in spring 2005. The
second phase is projected to be ready for commercial operation by the first quarter of 2008.

After finding the proposal data adequate, the Energy Commission named Commissioner Robert Pernell to be Presiding Member
of the Cosumnes Power Plant Project Siting Committee. Commissioner Arthur H. Rosenfeld, Ph.D. will serve as Associate
Member. During the certification process, the Committee is responsible for overseeing all hearings and related proceedings on
the proposed power plant.

Some of the issues to be examined over the course of the review include environmental impacts, air quality, water, biological
resources, public health and safety, the transmission system and engineering design. As part of the review process, the
Commission and staff encourage comments from local, state and federal agencies, as well as the general public. Once the
review process is complete, the Committee will draft a formal recommendation for the other Commissioners to consider before
taking final action at a full hearing of the Energy Commission.

The Energy Commission's website provides information on the proposed project at:

                                        www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/smud/

Public participation is a very important part of the Energy Commission approval process. To find out how to get involved, call the
Energy Commission's Public Adviser, Roberta Mendonca, at (916) 654-4489, toll free at (800) 822-6228, or by e-mail at [
