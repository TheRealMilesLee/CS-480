Chris--

Could you find out if Patina has performed a gas analysis on the zone to
be completed at your new well.  If/when you receive a gas analysis, our
operations guys like to review this data for all new interconnects
(obviously, this information is kept confidential).

Thanks.  

Dan


P.S.  As we approach an "in-service date" (which is estimated to be
during the first half of December), let's get together with Mark Whitt
to discuss and coordinate gathering and marketing strategies.
