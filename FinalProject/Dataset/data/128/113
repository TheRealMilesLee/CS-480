	Marianne,

	Would you let me know how you are doing on the revisions that we discussed to your good due diligence memo in this matter?  There is another joint defense conference call coming up on Thursday at 1:30, and I'd like to see where you are.  FYI, AEP's attorneys have agreed to allow me to speak with Steve Schneider of HPL about what he recalls any Enron entity had down in Zapata County.  I have a call in to Steve and hope to speak with him before 2:30 today or tomorrow morning.

	Many thanks.
	
	Britt
