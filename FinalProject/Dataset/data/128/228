Karen,

Thanks for taking the time to discuss the confidentiality agreement pertaining to the ENA Trading Track.  As discussed, I am following up with a couple of questions regarding the contents of the agreement, specifically item 1.2.  From what I gather, the agreement very broadly covers the financial industry and I wanted to list a few scenarios to see if they are included or not included by the agreement.
- Non energy, non commodity based private equity firms
- Non energy-sector coverage within a mutual fund company
- Non derivatives based hedge fund
- Non energy based investment banking
- Equity research in with non-energy or commodity industry coverage

Please let me know for each of the above what is included and excluded.

Regards,

Gary Linhart
