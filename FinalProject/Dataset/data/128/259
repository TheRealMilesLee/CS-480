Dear Friend,

I hope this meets you in good health. My name is Barrister Yemi Lawson, 
Esq. a legal practitioner and Attorney to late Mr. Ziya Bazhayev who 
died in the plane crash of Yak-40 jetliner on March 9, 2000. You may 
follow the Link below to read about the Plane Crash my client lost his 
life:
 
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/europe/672849.stm

My late client was an influential wealthy businessman,a Russian 
Contractor in my Country and a Russian big time Oil dealer and the 
Principal owner of Oil Alliance Company and he left behind a deposit of 
Twelve Million,Two Hundred Thousand United States Dollar 
($12,200,000.00USD) in his domiciliary bank account in a commercial 
bank here in Nigeria. Which is one of the main reasons it has been very 
important to locate his next of kin. I have employed
every method to locate any of my clients extended relatives but this 
exercise has proved unsuccessful.

After the death of my client his bankers contacted me,as his Attorney 
to provide his next of kin who should inherit his fortune. The board of 
directors of his bank adopted a resolution and I was mandated to 
provide his next of kin for the payment of this money or forfeit the 
money to the bank as an abandoned Estate. The bankers had planned to 
invoke a clause in the property Act, to confiscate the funds after the 
expiration of a period given to me.

Despairing and at the point of desperation, I came across your name, 
while trying to locate documentation's regarding possible relatives of 
my client in his country of origin. Convinced that you may be able to 
act in locus for my late client as his next of kin, I therefore, 
decided to contact you with these facts before me because of the status 
quo. By virtue of my brief and my closeness to the deceased, I am very 
much aware of my client's financial standing and the bank account he 
operates here in my country.

I have reasoned very professionally and I feel it will be legally 
proper to present you as the next of kin of my deceased client and the 
sole beneficiary of his estate, so that you are be paid the funds left 
in his bank account,hence I contacted you. I seek your consent to 
present you as the Next of Kin; the bank needs only the facts as 
presented legally. The rest is between you and I and with my guide we 
can have the money paid into your account, once this is done we shall 
both share the funds. 50% to me and 40% to you, while 10% should be for 
Expenses or Taxes as your Government may require, I shall assemble all 
the necessary Legal Documents that will be used to back up our claim.

All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal 
through I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate 
arrangement that will protect you from any Breach of law.

Please get in touch with me.

Best Regards,

Barrister Yemi Lawson (Esq).
