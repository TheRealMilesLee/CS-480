Investment Offer.
 
Good Day,
 
This letter might surprise you because we have not met neither in person nor by
correspondence. But I believe it is one day that you get to know somebody either
in physical or through correspondence. I got your contact through some discreet
inquiry from the chamber of commerce and industry, you were revealed as being
quite astute in private entrepreneurship, one has no doubt in your ability to
handle a financial business transaction. 
 
However,I am the first son of his Royal Majesty, Iginawari Nweke Adisaraki III
and the traditional ruler of Eleme Province in the oil area of Rivers State of
Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in respect of US 28,000,000.00 (Twenty
eight million United States Dollars) whicih I inherited from my late father.
This money was accumulated from royalties paid to my father as compensation by
the oil firms located in our area as a result of oil presence on our land which
hamper agriculture which is our major source of livelihood. Unfortunately my
father died from protracted diabetes. But before he called my attention and
informed me that he lodged some funds on a two boxes with a security firm with
an open beneficiary status. The lodgment Security Code Number was also revealed
to me, he then advised me to look for a reliable business partner abroad, who
will assist me in investing the money in a lucrative business as a result of
economic instability in Nigeria. 
 
So this is the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move this money
from the security firm to any country of your choice for investment purposes. So
I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so that the funds can be moved
in your name and particulars to any country of your choice where it will be
claimed and invested.
 
Hence my father have had intimated the security firm personnel that the
beneficiary of the Box is his foreign partner whose particulars will be
forwarded to the firm when due. But I will guide you accordingly. As soon as the
fund reaches, I will then come over to meet you in person, so that we can
discuss physically on Investment entials.Based on this instance I and my family
have unanimously decided to give you 20% of the total money and annual 5% of the
after tax returns on investment for the first three years.Thereafter, the term
shall be varied. 2% for charity homes and 3% for expenses, which may arise
during the transaction, fax and phone bills inclusive. The balance of 70% you
will invest and manage for my family. 
 
I hereby guarantee you that this is not government money, it is not drug money
and it is not money from arms deal.Though you have to maintain high degree of
confidentiality on this matter. I will give you all proof of deposit and
existence of money once urged and fully satisfied with your capability and
honesty. I hope this will be the beginning of a prosperous relationship between
my family and your family.
 
Nevertheless if you are for any reason not interested, kindly inform me
immediately so that I will look for another contact. 
 
I required also your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication.I am
waiting for your quick response through my private email address due to the
insecurity in this country by scammers.Please understand my plight.
 
I am waiting for your quick response.
 
Yours faithfully, 
 
Prince Tunde Olusola Adisaraki (For the Family)
