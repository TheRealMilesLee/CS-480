I just faxed all of you the new DA language moments ago.  This went to
legislative counsel last night.  The bill may be heard by the Assembly
Energy Committee tomorrow.  Draft language will not be available until
either late today or early tomorrow.

Late yesterday, the Governor met with various large users including the
Chamber, CMTA, WSPA, CLECA, CRA and BOMA.  They are all opposed to the bill
for a variety of reasons but most importantly, because the entire repayment
burden rests on their shoulders.  CLECA, CMTA and WSPA are especially upset
about self generation which essentially disappears under the new provisions
of the bill.  Also, none of them consider the DA language beneficial.
