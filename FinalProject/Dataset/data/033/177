In addition to Scott's news, Assembly Democrats believe they have the
votes to pass the proposal as is.  Sen. Burton has been meeting with the
Speaker off and on most of the morning and even members such as Sher,
whose bill will be amended with the language, has not been included.
Burton is not sharing information with his staff on the status of the
negotiations yet.  Everyone I spoke with says either a deal is hammered
out over this language or its over.  As far as we can tell Republicans
are out of the play altogether.

On another note, a representative from CSU approached me to say they are
negotiating to extend their contract with Enron but have concerns that
Enron will leave the state because it won't be able to grow its business
under the legislative proposal or pending PUC action.  He asked us to
find out what Enron's plan is under these circumstances.  So, will one
of you share with us what the plan is, or at least, how we respond to
this question.  Thanks.
