Dear Friend 
This proposal is to you if you can assist me in all
sincerity.Time is 
against.I work in a bank in Africa. I will give you the
name of my bank 
and other
important information if I receive a positive reply from
you. For 
security
reasons I cannot disclose my full identity to you now until
I am sure 
of your
cooperation. I work in the operations dept where I serve as
account 
officer to
numerous customers. One of the customers whom I worked as
his account 
officer
has this secret about the source of his funds and confides
in me to 
help him.I will brief you once i am sure about you ok. 
Because this man was good to me, I took it upon myself to
travel to his country last month, to see if I could locate
any of his 
close
relations . I want you to keep this strictly confidential,
his name is 
Vincent Arap Moi of Kenya. For more information you can
visit these 
website:

I sponsored this trip on my own and nobody in the bank knew
I was undertaking the journey so I did not present any
official report 
of my
findings in Nigeria.
Now there are two things I could do with regards to the
dead mans 
money. First,
as his son's accounts officer, I could formally notify the
bank 
authorities that the
man is dead and has no next of kin. In this case the money
would be 
forfeited
to the government after some time. As a matter of fact this
is the 
proper thing
I am supposed to do. 
Another thing I can do is to arrange for someone else, a
foreigner, to 
act as
the next of kin of the late man so that he will claim the
money. This 
is the
option that I can do to help anybody and myself since the
money 
actually is public fund due to the fact that the ate
president was a close 
ally to the late brutal military president that looted
government treasury 
and that is why I have chosen to do it. I want you to be
my partner. All you would have to do is act as the next of
kin of the 
dead man
and the whole money in the account will be transferred to
your account. 
As the
accounts officer to the late man's son, I have all the
necessary 
documents that you
will require to claim the money in the account.
The total money in the account is USD17 million. Your share
will be 30% 
which
is USD5,100,000. My own share will be 69%, which is
USD11,730,000. We 
shall
keep 1% which is USD170,000 for expenses.
Reach me immediately by mail so that I can give you further

details.Also provide me you with direct tel/fax to reach
you and let me know if 
you have a good offshore account that can carry this sum of
money?
Yours truly     [Reply to francmani@yahoo.com for our
