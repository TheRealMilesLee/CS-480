Still trying to get John Goodpasture, who is representing Clean Fuels to give us an indicative or firm price. I hound him on a daily basis and can't understand why he won't quote us a price. As you may know the methanol plant has stopped operating and we soon will have to supply the MTBE plant with third party methanol barrels and we will need tankage to discharge barges and cargoes before the methanol goes to Morgan's Pt. Nowlan's thought was to have Mike intercede with Horton to move the process along, but Mike would rather save his bullets with Stan for a later day. If you have any stroke with Goodpasture or can strong arm him better than I have been able to do then I would appreciate your help. These barrels are critical to our long term supply and ability to discharge foreign cargoes of methanol. We also are evaluating a pipeline from the methanol tanks to the MTBE facility to save the barge freight and make Morgan's Pt more efficient.

Subject:	Methanol tanks

Per notification from Jim Prentice it appears the Enron methanol plant will cease production this Friday. Global Products has made arrangements to purchase our methanol feedstock requirements from outside sources once we have taken the balance of the methanol production at the plant. We have been working with John Goodpasture to purchase the methanol tanks at the Enron methanol plant for our future methanol feedstock storage. These tanks are able to store in excess of 400,000 barrels. We are still waiting for an indicative price on the tanks and the latest was a comment from Prentice who said Clean Fuels needs to do their fiduciary duty and check the market for the tanks' value. Since these tanks are probably on their books at zero we are hopeful that they would offer us a favorable price. The only other issue is that the dock leading to/from the tanks is owned by Oxy and we would need a long term arrangement with Oxy to utilize their dock to access the tanks. Again, Goodpasture was checking with Oxy on this issue. In addition, EOTT is willing to operate the facility, if necessary.

Mike--could you please contact Stan Horton and get him to engage in the discussions so we can move the process forward and have Clean Fuels offer us a price on the tanks? This is important because we will soon be bringing in cargoes/barges in excess of the methanol tankage at the Morgan's Pt. MTBE plant and we will need a place to store it.
