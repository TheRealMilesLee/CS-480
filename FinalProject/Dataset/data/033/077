Dear Sir/ Madam
How are you today? I am Dr. Thomas Fernandez a consultant cardiologist and I guess you must be surprised as we have not met personally before now. Over the years, 
I had a patient Mrs. Patricia Maria Gonzales who had protracted illness and I was very close to her in her last days. I was not too surprised when I was mentioned in her Will. She also left specific instructions that I look out for someone of repute to put to use the sum of Seventeen Million Four Hundred and Fifty thousand United States Dollars (USD$17.450.000.00) for Humanitarian purposes.
I have received routine notifications from her investor over the years now. I did look out for a couple of well known names here and abroad who could administer these funds for Humanitarian Activities. Following the aftermath of Sept.11th when some of these well known names were found not to have used the funds given to them for Humanitarian Activities, I then decided to look out for someone whom I could introduce to the investor as someone who will administer the usage of the funds. After proper discussions, I will write to her investor and introduce you. I intend to use 50% of the total sum personally for Humanitarian Activities in  accordance with the wish of Mrs. Patricia Maria Gonzales. 
This way, I will be sure that the funds are judiciously put to use. As I am looking at  war ravaged countries of the world and also the tsunami affected areas in Asia. I am offering you 20% for your help. You might wonder why I have decided to look for someone whom I have not had transactions with before, this is as a result of the fact that I prefer to have this transaction with someone whom after collection would 
proceed  back to his country and not with someone whom I will have to continually live  with. He might later develop negative ideas in the future so I will prefer to have this sorted out with someone not too close.  
However, if you do not feel comfortable with the transaction, please feel free and discontinue while I want to reassure you though that you have nothing  to worry about.
I await your response.
Dr. Thomas Fernandez.
Please send your response to drtomdez@tiscali.fr
