Memo to Jaime Williams to come shortly here are some other answers:

*NO corporate jet usage by Alatorre in 2001 (that was all we checked).

*The three expense reports that you have on Alatorre are all that have been paid post Max

*Susan is checking to see if there is one floating around waiting to be paid

*Susan is closing petty cash bank account - she will let us know when complete
