Dear Friend

RE: UNCLAIMED FUNDS

What I relate to you via this message is very urgent but I urge you to re=
ad
on for your assistance. There exists a dormant account belonging to a non=
-Swiss
indigene since World War II.It may interest you to know that in July of
1997, the Swiss Banker's  Association published a list of dormant account=
s
originally opened by non-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant
since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945).Most belonged to Holocaust vi=
ctims.
The continuing efforts of various government set up committees have since=

resulted in the discovery of additional dormant accounts -54,000 in Decem=
ber,
1999. 
The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including inte=
rest-bearing
savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit boxes,custody account=
s,
and non-interest-bearing transactionaccounts.Numbered accounts are also
included. Interest is paid on accounts that were interest bearing when es=
tablished.
The Claims Tribunal handles processing of all claims on accounts due non-=
Swiss
citizens.

 A dormant account holder (deceased) with a credit balance of 21,000,000
US dollar plus accumulated interest was discovered by me, in my bank. The=

beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era,Leaving no WILL and no
possible records for trace of heirs. The Claims Tribunal has been mandate=
d
to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and trans=
fer
of existing credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as=

provided by the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries wh=
o
died interstate (living no wills). Being an insider in the bank, I have
all secret details and necessary contacts for claim of the funds without
any hitch.The funds will be routed via a private financial facility, bein=
g
a safe haven for the funds and we can share the funds and use in investme=
nt
of our choice. 

Due to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim
the funds.All that is required is for you to provide me with your details=

for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents
for transfer of the funds to you, to this regard, you are expected to fil=
l
out a text form. I will pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is
transferred to a secured, numbered account in your name, where you will
be capable 
of accessing the funds and gradually transfering to your country and othe=
r
banks of choice in the world. You can find additional information about
unclaimed funds at the following websites: http://www.swissbankclaims.com=

,http://www.wiesenthal.com

The Claims Processing Office has put funds in Escrow, awaiting submission=

of valid claims for necessary disbursement.I find myself priviledged to
have this information and this is a great opportunity of a life time of
success without risks. Due to security reasons, reply via email only. If
you are interested and capable of handling this transaction,please reply
with your details at: hitb@financier.com 

I await your urgent response to this proposal,

My Regards

Mr. Edward Smith
