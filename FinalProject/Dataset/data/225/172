JOSE LUIS BITA,
(Accountant).
 
For your attention:  

My name is, Jose Luis Bita, an accountant with Banco Santander Central =
Hispano. Madrid - Spain and I have a very confidential proposal for you. I =
got your mail address on internet and  decided to contact you for this =
operation.The issue is, my bank plays host to billions of dollars in cash =
money, gold and diamond in storage, deposited by very important personalities =
around the world, especially past presidents, politicians  government =
officials, and directors of multinational companies. I have seen much in my =
years of service with this bank.  
All  deposits are coded with security codes, sometime some of the deposits =
are unclaimed especially when the depositor dies without living a concret =
address for fear of being probed by his government. When this happens, after =
some time the artifacts are bidded for and the physical cash goes to the =
government account. All deposits are reviewed at interval by the depositor or =
the next of kin for update.
This is where we have our opportunity there is a deposit of $39.000.000 =
(thirty nine million dollars), that we have the secret codes and details of =
the depositor.  He only left a clause in the documents that" My sister will =
come for this deposit and it should be released to her quoting the secret =
codes. The man died 3 days after he deposited in the private vault, he was =
killed in a terrorist attack. Nobody has come forward  for the deposit since =
then and he left no traceable address, now myself and some collegues have =
access to the deposit documents and secret codes which we can modify to name =
you as the next of kin which you will relate to my bank director for the =
deposit to be released to you. An attorney will prepare the necessary  =
documents, to authorize you to claim, including the deposit certificate which =
I will send to you also. This operation does not involve any risk because we =
the insiders will control all the movements.
 If you are interested, reply to this mail address jluisbita@yahoo.es   and I =
will give you more informations. Please observe utmost confidentiality, this =
is a chance.

Kind regards, 
Jose Luis Bita.
