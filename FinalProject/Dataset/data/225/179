Dear sir,

My name is MR Jeff Papiez, the elder son of Mr. Eric Papiez of Zimbabwe. This might be a surprise to you about where I got your contact address or information.

I got your address from the South African Chamber of Commerce And Industry in Johannesburg here in South Africa. During the Remote and current wars against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the supports of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned farms to his party members and his followers, he ordered all white farmers to surrender all their farms to his party members and his followers. My late father was one of the best and riches farmers in my country and because he did not support Mugabe's dictatorial ideas, Mugabe?s supporters invaded my father's farm and burnt everything in the farm, killing my father and his workers and made away with a lot of items in my father's farm. 

Before his death, my father had deposited with one of the Security Company in Johannesburg, South Africa the sum of US$42 million (Forty-two Million United States Dollars) with my name as the next of kin. After the death of my father, I decided to move to the Republic of South Africa where he (my father) had deposited the money in the Security Company as a box containing Diplomatic valuables for security reasons.

According to the instructions of my late, I wish to contact you as an
overseas/foreign business partner or beneficiary to the fund to assist me move or transfer this money out of South Africa.

According to the directions of my late daddy, on my arrival in SOUTH AFRICA I obtained refugee permit for security reasons. As an asylum seeker, I am not allowed to operate or run any form of bank account within South Africa because the refugee laws here does not permit asylum seekers certain financial rights such as running any form of account and that is the more reason why I need a foreign assistance who is willing and capable of flying down to SOUTH AFRICA to open a non-resident/Dollar investment account where the total sum will be deposited before onward transfer to the person's account overseas. If you are willing and capable of caring out the transaction.

We have agreed to offer you 20% of the total sum for your assistance, 5% has also been mapped out for any expenses that might be incurred in the course of this transaction and 75% will be for me and my family's investments in your country. All I want from you is sincerity and to furnish me with your personal phone and fax numbers for easier and faster communication. 
You can contact me on the above email address or my alternative email:jeffpapiez@mighty.co.za
 
(Note) This transaction is 100% risk-free and absolutely confidential.
 
Thanks and God bless. 
Best Regards, 
Jeff Papiez
