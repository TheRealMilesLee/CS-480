SOLICITING FOR A BUSINESS VENTURE AND PARTNERSHIP

Dear Friend,

First and foremost, I apologize for using this medium to communicate a
business proposal of this magnitude , this is solely because of the
confidentiality nature repose on the net; before I go on further, I must be
grateful to introduce myself. My name is Mr. Paul Wayne a Liberian. I was
formerly the chief campaign manager to Mr. Charles Taylor the president of
Liberia and I was also a personal aid to the Minister of trade in the depose
administration of Mr. Charles Taylor.Due to my position and closeness with
the President, I absconded with Thirty.Five Million United States Dollars
(US$30.5M) which was part of the money that was initially meant for
campaigning for President Charles Taylor re-election into office before the
recent crisis that led to his depose from office. Presently I have been able
to move the funds diplomatically to a reputable Finance Company in the
Netherlands where I now reside as refugee; and I do not have the intention
of returning home for fear of being assassinated by members of the
opposition party to Mr. Charles Taylor under whose administration I
served.MY REQUEST As a result of my present situation as a refugee who
cannot have access to own an account or accounts, I am therefore faced with
the dilemma of seeking for a trustworthy individual/firm that can advice me
in making the rightful investment as well as to provide account(s) where the
funds will be lodge into. More also, we are at the interim interested in
buying properties for residence as my family and I will be residing there in
the near future. Please be aware that my family are also in a safe location
and I am in contact with them.
 COMMISSION/REMUNERATION As regards your commission/remuneration, I and my
immediate family have decided to offer you 20% of the total sum and also set
aside 5% for all your expenses (i.e telephone bills, traveling expenses,
hotel bills and other miscellaneous expenses). NOTE: I shall commit half of
my own share of the total sum into a joint venture project preferably in the
purchase of Real Estate or other profitable business venture within your
knowledge existing in your area. Be assured that you stand no risk of any
kind as the funds in question belong to me alone. As soon as I get your
consent, I will furnish you with the details and contact of the Security
Company and after a few more details have being communicated, we shall then
proceed to arrange for a face to face meeting in order to know each other
better and also discuss the terms  and conditions of the partnership
extensively.I strongly believe that associating with you to embark on this
and other business ventures will derive a huge success hereafter and it will
be a long lasting business association. If you have any question, do not
fail to contact me with my e-mail address (paulwayne@mmail.com) I await your
anticipated co-operation. 

Yours truly, 
Mr. PAUL WAYNE.
