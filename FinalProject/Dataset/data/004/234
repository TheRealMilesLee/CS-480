resulted from grossly over-invoiced contract executed for
the FMW&H during the last administration. The companies
that executed the contract have been duly paid and the
contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US $42.462M

matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for

S$42.462M by legally subcontracting the contract
entitlement to your company. We have agreed that the funds
