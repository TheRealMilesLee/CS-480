Gerald,

Here is another GTC Dedicated Reserves confirm that needs preparing. Here is the well information:

Field/County/State: 		?  / ? / Texas
Well Name:			Heard #1
Meter No./Pipeline: 		01-1990/Tennessee Gas Pipeline

How critical is the Field & County?  I just can't find that information.  I have the schedulers looking for it so if/when they find it I will forward that to you.
