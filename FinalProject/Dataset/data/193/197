: New Date Rape Drug - Beware

 
DATE RAPE DRUG TARGETS MALES

 (URP) - Police warn all male clubbers, party-goers, and unsuspecting pub
 regulars to be alert and stay cautious when offered a drink from any woman.

 A new date rape drug on the market, called "beer," is used by females to
 target unsuspecting men.

 The drug is generally found in liquid form, and is now available almost anywhere.
 "Beer" is used by female sexual predators at parties and bars to persuade their
 male victims to go home and have sex with them.
 Typically, a woman needs only to persuade a guy to consume a few units of
 "beer" and then simply ask him home for no-strings-attached sex.
 Men are rendered helpless against this approach. After several "beers"
 men will often succumb to desires to perform sexual acts on horrific looking
 women to whom they would never normally be attracted.

After drinking "beer," men often awaken with only hazy memories of
exactly what happened to them the night before, often with just a vague
feeling that something bad occurred. At other times these unfortunate men
 are swindled out of their life's savings in a familiar scam known as "a
relationship."

Apparently men are much more susceptible to this scam after "beer" is
 administered and sex is offered by the predatory female.

 Please! Forward this warning to every male you know.  However, if you fall
victim to this insidious "beer" and the predatory women administering it,
 there are male support groups with venues in every town where you can
discuss the details of your shocking encounter in an open and frank manner
with similarly affected, like-minded guys.  For the support group nearest you,
just look up "Golf Courses" in the yellow pages.
