Hi Everyone:
It has been a crazy first week back after the holidays, and I failed to get a 
meeting notice sent out.  Nonetheless, we will have our last meeting of the 
2001 Children's Ministry Team on Monday, January 14, at 7:30 in the 
Fellowship Hall.  This will be an informal hour-long meeting at which we will 
celebrate and review the past year as well as share dreams for the future.  
We also will have something good to eat, i.e. a low-fat (maybe) dessert!  I 
hope everyone will be able to make it.  
Happy New Year!
