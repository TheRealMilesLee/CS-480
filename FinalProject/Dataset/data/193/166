Wysak Petroleum announces the signing of a Letter of Intent with the European
Commission Baltic Renewab|e Energy Centre (EC BREC) to assist Wysak Petro|eum in
the deve|opment of the Wysak Wind Power Project.

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the development of a
ful|-sized Commercia| Wind Power Project in Europe. This |etter states that EC
BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financial structuring and investment,
regulatory issues, government policies, negotiations, wind technologies, and
other aspects re|ating to Wind Power.

About the Wysak Wind Project

This development wil| be up to a maximum 9OMw in size and cost upwards of $12O
milli0n in development expenditures. Once comp|eted, this Wind Park wil| supp|y
upwards of 170,00O Mw of electricity annually for Poland and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supply upwards of 25,0OO homes with
e|ectricity and offset nearly 170,00O tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Total gross
electric sa|es over a 20-year period are estimated at over $45O mi|liOn for a
project this size.

deve|opment of renewable energy sources (RES) in Poland through the construction
of RES projects, the development of innovative techno|ogies, and the creation of
re|evant po|icies, strategies and plans. To fulfil| the mission, EC BREC uses
its own research capabilities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and international organizations.
