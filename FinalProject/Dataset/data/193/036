I echo Jon Gail's disappointment about the winter season.  Jon Bloomfield 
and I are looking into scheduling a time to have a practice of some kind 
(most likely just pick-up soccer) that perhaps can meet regularly.  We will 
keep you posted.

As for the spring season, the registration deadline is February 18, so 
although the season doesn't start until April, the sooner you can send me or 
Jon your moneys, the easier it is on us.

Hope to be in touch with you all soon.  If you play on TBA, I'll see you 
tonight.

Adam
