Subject: Money
  





It can buy a House...............But not a Home  

It can buy a Bed..................But not Sleep  

It can buy a Clock................But not Time  

It can buy you a Book..........But not knowledge  

It can buy you a Position......But not Respect  

It can buy you Medicine.......But not Health  

It can buy you Blood............But not Life  

It can buy you Sex..............But not Love  

So you see money isn't everything.  

And it often causes pain and suffering.  

I tell you all this because...........  

I am your Friend, and as your Friend I want to take away your pain
and  suffering..............  

So send me all your money..........  

And I will suffer for you.  

CASH ONLY PLEASE  

Thought this was gonna be one of those "inspirational" ones, didn't
