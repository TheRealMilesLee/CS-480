Thanks for dinner last night - I enjoyed talking with you and meeting
Eric..... Here is the poem you requested.


Paranoid 

Do you really care what I have to say? 
Are you going to end up ignoring me anyway? 
Should I sit here like a statue in stone? 
Do I really like feeling so alone? 

What did I do to the world to feel this way? 
Why am I so paranoid everyday? 
My mind lives in a constant shade of black 
I always want to run and pack 

To find a world that's all my own 
Somewhere I can finally call home 
But the fear remains with me   
It's all I can see 

Why does everybody stare? 
Or even glare 
They say it's all in my head 
It's like I'm a ghost back from the dead 

It's scary to be left alone 
Even inside my own home 
Everyone's out to get me 
All after me 

Now when you ask me what's wrong? 
It takes me too long 
To figure out 
What the questions about 

Do you really care what I have to say? 
Are you going to end up ignoring me anyway? 
Should I sit here like a statue in stone? 
Do I really like feeling so alone?
