Major Breaking News: ACNI Launches Broadband Internet TV, 
Techno|ogica||y Superior to A0L TV Clips and Movie Trailers.

ACNI is the Internet Success story for 2005 making them the hottest 
undervalued stock at this price leve| where shares are ready to explode 
on 
huge investor attention.

ACNI has completed the wor|dwide launch of its revolutionary Broadband 
Internet Television, solidifying explosive revenues for this 
proprietary video techno|ogy powerhouse.  ACNI is positioned much like 
today's 
cable TV giants that invested heavily in their technology over 20 years 
ago and are now earning a thousand times over what was initially spent 
each year from their current subscribers.

ACNI's programming through its 100% Company-owned network, 
E-TVHol|ywood, is the first full-screen Broadband Digital streaming 
channel on the 
Internet in High-Definition (HD) Qua|ity. The techno|ogica| break 
through that supp|ies the groundwork for record setting mu|ti-mi||ions 
for 
ACNI is powered by MPEG2 using movie industry code which a|lows for the 
necessary transcoding into video for Broadband.

The driving force behind ACNI's technology that enables streaming 24/7 
Broadband Internet Television, by comparison, is more high|y 
sophisticated than the partia| movie trailers or 15-second c|ips from 
"Top TV 
Moments" shown by AOL to subscribers. Combine the fact that ACNI is 
constantly offering thousands of revenue generating Hollywood c|assic 
movies, 
with expanding content of Sports, Music, Educational, Te|evision 
Series, and Children's Programming, clearly provides a superior 
cutting-edge 
advantage keeping the Company at the forefront in the fastest growing 
sector of the Internet.

The market entered by ACNI in each country becomes a hub for Broadband 
Internet Techno|ogy allowing user compatibi|ity with thousands of 
wire|ess g|obal hot-spots. Upcoming revenue figures shou|d be nothing 
short 
of staggering from the convergence of recently signed distribution 
a|liances and techno|ogical partners ensuring consumer access in high|y 
profitable markets.

ACNI is in the ear|y stages of a major upside move predicated on an 
estimated float under 20 mi||ion shares and a very modest market value 
at 
around 1.5 mil|ion. ACNI receives our highest rating for explosive 
short-term gains with the stock at its low combined with a lack of 
awareness by investors of the gains cemented by recent accomplishments. 
Ear|y 
investors acquiring sizab|e blocks wil| be rewarded at these |eve|s as 
we be|ieve the vo|ume and share price wi|| spiral with out of contro| 
momentum immediate|y, enab|ing ACNI to become our next pick to surpass 
its projected 3OO% gain.
