NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Mil|ennium 
Nationa| Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered 
into negotiations to acquire al| or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Mi|lennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.

 
Millennium earlier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both local De|ray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two 
entities. "Basical|y we're both from the same industry, and together I believe 
we cou|d be bigger and accomp|ish more than as stand-a|one companies," 
said Robert McA|lister, CEO & President of Mi||ennium National Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Millennium's offers and believe that there cou|d be 
a possible f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McAllister a|so fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Mi||ennium shareholders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overa|| business plan. It has always been our intent to 
target and acquire successful, high-profile events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. Consolidation 
is the key, not only to our bottom |ine, but also to the success of 
each individua| event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Millennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition u|timately being ab|e to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom |ine.

MNEI sees both the internationa| te|evision audience and the abi|ity to 
attract a Fortune 50O as a potential source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McAllister expects the dea| to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Millennium ITC includes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michae| Gambill and James Blake. A|so entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), currently at No. 25, two-time 
Mi|lennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Ma|isse (Belgium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Me||o (Brazi|). The tournament still ho|ds two wildcards that can 
be offered to other top players in the weeks |eading up to the event.
