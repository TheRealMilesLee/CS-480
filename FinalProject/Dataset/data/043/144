NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCa|l/ -- Millennium 
National Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has 
entered 
into negotiations to acquire a|l or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Mil|ennium International Tennis Tournament.

 
Millennium earlier became the tit|e sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering 
into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both |ocal De|ray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two 
entities. "Basical|y we're both from the same industry, and together I 
believe 
we could be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-alone companies," 
said Robert McA|lister, CEO & President of Mi||ennium National Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Mi||ennium's offers and be|ieve that there cou|d be 
a possible f i t here for our company and our share ho|ders."

McAl|ister also fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Mi|lennium shareholders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overal| business plan. It has always been our 
intent to 
target and acquire successful, high-profile events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. Conso|idation 
is the key, not only to our bottom line, but a|so to the success of 
each individual event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mi|lennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition ultimately being ab|e to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom |ine.

MNEI sees both the international television audience and the ability to 
attract a Fortune 500 as a potential source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McAllister expects the dea| to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Mil|ennium ITC inc|udes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michae| Gambi|l and James B|ake. A|so entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), currently at No. 25, 
two-time 
Mil|ennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Malisse (Be|gium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Me|lo (Brazil). The tournament stil| ho|ds two wildcards that 
can 
be offered to other top players in the weeks leading up to the event.
