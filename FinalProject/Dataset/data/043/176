           Internet Daily for Tuesday, September 4, 2001

Cable seen as primary broadband provider

Cable TV companies will be the dominant providers of high-speed 
Internet access services, according to market research released 
Tuesday by the Yankee Group. The Boston-based consulting firm 
expects cable to provide broadband to 15.7 million residential 
households by the end of 2005. DSL will be the choice in 10.5 
million, satellite by 4.5 million and fixed wireless will serve 
359,000. "Cable operators are uniquely placed to drive broadband 
penetration, resulting from greater availability, lower prices 
and quicker provisioning," the Yankee report said.

MP3.com may add videos, games

Vivendi's MP3.com is expected to expand its file sharing choices 
to include music videos and perhaps eventually game software. 
President Robin Richards said movie trailers may also be offered 
through a new Web site, MP4.com, according to The Wall Street 
Journal. Richards said he is "actively pursuing" offering games, 
but there are no firm plans.

The Motley Fool to sell professional advice

The Motley Fool will announce plans this week to partner with 
financial planning firm Ayco Co. of Albany, N.Y., to sell advice 
online. The fee-for-service advice is expected to initially cost 
$149 a year, the Washington Post reported. Subscribers would 
receive information online as well as be able to call and speak 
with planners. Daniel O'Brien, a senior analyst at Forrester 
Research Inc., commented, "These sorts of services, while not 
antithetical to The Motley Fool's ethos, are less about doing 
your own homework and more about relying on professionals."

Journal Interactive launches 4th niche site

Dow Jones' Wall Street Journal has debuted 
RealEstateJournal.com. The free site includes information about 
buying, selling, leasing, managing and investing in residential 
and commercial properties. It joins other Journal efforts 
including CareerJournal.com, StartupJournal.com and 
OpinionJournal.com. The new real estate site includes access to 
the residential listing database maintained by Realtor.com, 
regional market reports and a searchable database of commercial 
properties for sale and lease.
