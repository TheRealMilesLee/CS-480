Hey Jeff
Yep there were a lot of people.  The class seems a lot
more like an undergrad class: lecture style, one small
book,  only one exam-in class final, no name tags, no
attendance monitoring. Lecture seems to VERY closely
mirror the book. While the logistics look favorable
from a time perspective, I'm not sure how promising it
looks from a "wow" that was a great class perspective.
  

Class held from 6:00 til 8:30 ish, w/ a 5 min break
(we voted).
Hope you're havin fun on vacation!  Let me know if
you're going to go to this class, or want to catch up
on Tues durng break-
Courtney
