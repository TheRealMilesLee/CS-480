Now that the latest round of TW's negotiated rate hearing is behind us, we can re-focus our attention on the monthly reporting requirements imposed by the FERC on July 25, 2001.  Please review the attached document that addresses all the issues that were raised in prior meetings and provide your comments by COB September 7, 2001.  

I will then work with Don Powell to gather/compile the data required for the September 30th filing and distribute to the primary reviewers by mid-month.  Once the reviewers have had an opportunity to analyze the data, we can distribute for review and discussion.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

 


Thanks,
Elizabeth
