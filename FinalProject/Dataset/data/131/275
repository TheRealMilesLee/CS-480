This should not be a problem under the Merger Agreement so long as discontinuing the business unit/operation is "prudent in Enron's good-faith business judgment".  While that seems self-evident, we may want to document that language somewhere (in resolutions, a DASH, etc.) just to protect ourselves.  As to the payment, it is fine--and we don't need to track it--if the contract being terminated is not material.  Sounds like it isn't.

Should be okay; we need to check getting out of businesses though - as Joe and I discussed earlier.  Would you please answer his question, and cc me and Mark.  Thanks.

Lance -

It is my understanding that Enron Credit is currently closing down operations.  In light of this, EC has a contractual obligation to a company called Risk Metrics Group.  The obligation arises out of the development and hosting by RMG of a website devoted to the use of EC's credit risk data - the site being mainly focused toward subscribers to other RMG products.  Since we are terminating the development and hosting agreement - in essence shutting down the site - we will owe RMG approximately $96,000.

While I realize this is a small sum, I wanted to make sure (1) there are no approvals under the merger agreement that are required for a settlement of this nature and (2) if we are tracking this type of liability for merger purposes, that I provide the necessary information to the appropriate personnel.

Please let me know if either of the above are necessary.

Thanks.

Mark
