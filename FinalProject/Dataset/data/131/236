Subject: [Footballguys] News Update - Mike Anderson to Start
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

As we passed along to you yesterday, ESPNews was reporting that Olandis Gary
might get the starting nod for this weeks game.   It was reported in several
places, including CBS Sportsline.

Now CBS Sportsline is offering this
http://football0.commissioner.com/mp/pro-home?league=zero  :   "Contrary to
some earlier reports, Anderson will remain the starter in Denver's backfield
for now. Some reports had indicated that Olandis Gary would start in his
place."

This seems to be consistent with what the local Denver press is saying as
well.

Clearly, nothing is for certain with a Mike Shanahan Running Back Corps but
for now, it looks like Anderson is back as the starter although I wouldn't
be surprised to see Gary see some carries as well.

Thanks to Footballguy Bob Harris for sending me the email on this one which
he entitled "the truth shall set you free"...

Joe
