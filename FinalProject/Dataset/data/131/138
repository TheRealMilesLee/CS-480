Hi Zac - sorry it took a while to respond but things are quite busy here.  Yes, there are opportunities here.  However, the question is what our business looks like going forward given the circumstances facing Enron in the coming weeks and months.  I'm not sure how it is all going to play out.  I know there will be opportunities but how I'm going to go about filling those and what limits are placed on our business hasn't been made clear yet.  I'll be glad to take some time to sit down and talk about this with you and give you any direction I have.  You are welcome to call my secretary, Tamara Black, and get on my calendar.


Dana

Dana,

It has been a while since we have run into each other and had a chance to catch up.  I hope everything is going well for you and Rachel.  

I understand that there are currently opportunities in origination, structuring and trading within the East Power Trading group.  I am interested in those opportunties and would like to talk to you about them.  Do you have time to discuss the group, the opprotunities, etc.?

I look forward to talking to you,
Zac
