Dear Miss Causholli,
we have to advice you that our Master in Corporate Finance is
currently held in Italian and only partly (round 15%) in English.
It will be held entirely in English starting from its 2003-2004
edition. If you are anyway interested in receiving the brochure,
please tell us, and we will send it to you.
Best Regards,
