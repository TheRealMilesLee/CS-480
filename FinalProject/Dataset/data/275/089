My greetings,

Please read through this proposal with an open mind. It is highly legitimate 
and will not cost you anything financially or otherwise to execute.

I got your email address from a casual enquiry wherein I sought for 
trustworthy potential partners with whom to go into business with in the 
investment of some contact funds ( $ 8,500,000.00 U.S ) currently trapped. 
It is my hope that you will be of assistance in helping me free the trapped 
funds, transfer it, and put it to investment purpose. 10% of the funds will 
accrue to you for your assistance.

The source of the funds are as follows: During the last military regime in 
my country , government officials awarded contracts that were grossly 
over-invoiced to Contractors. The present civilian government set up the 
Contract Review Panel, and mandated it to use the instruments of payments 
made available to it by the decree setting up the panel, to review those 
contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding 
amounts.I have identified the above mentioned sum which have been lying 
unclaimed for years and would like to transfer and invest it. My position as 
a current serving Civil servant forbids me from operating foreign Bank 
accounts, this is why I need your assistance.

Here is where you come in : I need you to furnish me with the following 
information :

1. YOUR FULL NAMES
2. BUSINESS NAMES
3. ADDRESS
4. TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS

With these information, I will forward an application for payment in your 
busines's favour and ensure that it is approved. Upon the transfer of the 
funds, I will meet with you in your country so that we can go into 
investment after sharing in the agreed percentages ( 10% for you ).

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A SCAM YOU WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO PART WITH 
YOUR MONEY DURING OR AFTER THIS VENTURE.

Please do reply
Dr.John
