FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING
   FEDERAL SECRETARIAT
   LOME- LOMEGAN TOGO
   FROM:DR.DONATUS SABO CHilubaz

Dear Sir,

      ASSISTANCE REQUIRED FOR ACQUISITION OF ESTATE

I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates
or landed properties in your country on behalf of the
Director of Contracts and Finance Allocations of the
Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in Togo.

Considering his very strategic and influential
position, he would want the transaction to be as
strictly confidential as possible. He further wants
his identity to remain undisclosed at least for now,
untill the completion of the transaction.Hence our
desire to have an overseas agent.

I have therefore been directed to inquire if you
would agree to act as our overseas agent in order to
actualize this transaction.The deal, in brief, is
that the funds with which we intend to carry out our
proposed investments in your country is presently in a
coded account at the Togo Apex Bank i.e(the BANQUE
CENTRALE DES ETATS DE L'AFRIQUE DE L'OUEST)
and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to
your country in a convenient bank account that will be
provided by you before we can put the funds into use
in your country. For this, you shall be considered to
have executed a contract for the Federal Ministry of
Works and Housing in Togo for which payment should be
effected to you by the Ministry, The contract sum of
which shall run into US$28 000 000 Million,of  which
your share shall be 20% if you agree to be our
overseas agent.

As soon as payment is effected, and the amount
mentioned above is successfully transferred into your
account, we intend to use our own share in acquiring
some estates abroad. For this  too you
shall also serve as our agent. In the light of this, I
would like you to forward to me the following
informationed below:

1. Your company name and address if any
2. Your personal fax number
3. Your personal telephone number  for easy
communication.

You are requested to communicate your acceptance of
this proposal through
my above stated email address after which we shall
discuss in details the
modalities for seeing this transaction through.

Your quick response will be highly appreciated. Thank
you in anticipation of your cooperation.

Yours faithfully,

DR.DONATUS SABO CHilubaz
