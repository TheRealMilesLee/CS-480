Joe, see end of message.

Pig, the cart is in fine shape and has been taken to Austin by Chris and is
being stored at their yard. He advises that it should be retreived promptly,
theft concerns.

Chad and I have been investigating Trailer costs. 400 to 500, unless we get
lucky on a used one and they are scarce and we would still pay 350 for it.

Nobby Tires and lift kit can be done at Mission Equiptment for 800. to do it
ourselves (read chad) will cost at least 500 i guess in parts.

My thoughs. If you are still uncomfortable with transporting in your truck,
then we need to spend the money to get the trailer and drive as is and built
a box on the back. If you think it is ok, then consider spending money to do
tire and suspension job.
I will be in AUstin in a few weeks for depo and will be prepared to bring
unit home in a) purchased trailer b)rented trailer c)pigs truck.
Need to make a decision here.

Joe: Any word on borrowing friends mothers trailer? Any interest in becoming
a part owner? Any chance of being able to borrow Kim's grandfather's big ass
trailer to be pulled by my truck???

Trailer issues per chris, pulling one axle trailer that distance is tricky.
May wobble if load not well balanced. Probably ride better in back of truck
or on longer two axle trailer which will track better.
