My understanding is that the EPNG contract terminates today on its own terms if not rejected, and is deemed rejected automatically if we don't do anything to the contrary today.  There are some other contracts which will be deemed rejected on May 3rd unless assumed. Ruth is going to prepare a brief presentation to the BTRC for Thursday to deal with all of these matters instead of rushing in today.

If anyone disagrees with this description and/or game plan, please let me know.

Kay

PwC concurs with Kay.  We've alerted the Creditors, who in turn deferred to
the legal process since there is no value being waived.

I spoke with Chip.  This can be presented to the BTRC today at the 1 oclock
meeting, assuming we have all our ducks in a row.

Ed, Ruth, ready to go with this?
