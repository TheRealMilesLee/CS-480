Everyone - updates from testing last week, and communication of information/ going forward.
 
Thanks to all involved in last weeks testing.  Much has been accomplished.  We did encounter a legal mandated 'test freeze' on Friday given a legal communication came down to halt all data entry/ code changes, but as of Friday evening, it was eventually lifted.  Any unfinished testing can continue.
 
We've completed:
- Integration testing of 25 transaction type scenarios - from EOL entry, Sitara, TDS, Tagg.  This includes the sample testing of scripts, and the end to end testing to SAP.
- EOL has sent 13 gas and 4 financial transactions through downstream systems.
- Over 50 integration issues identified and resolved!  Majority were data setup issues, but code changes were identified, incorrect hardware being used, reports not running, start-up scripting issues resolved, replication issues resolved.
 
What's remaining to test and status:
1) EDI testing - Tammy Jaquet, Robert Virnau are expected to complete the EDI test by end of day today (01/28)
2) Financial Settlements/ EOL deals - Mechelle Stevens is completing her verification of EOL deals into Unify.  Testing is expected to complete the EDI test by end of day today (01/28).
3) SAP testing - SAP is still in requirements analysis with regards to GL account setup, profit centers.  A meeting is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon with the UBS, SAP, Netco leads.  SAP testing can be conducted between Unify and within SAP once decisions are determined.
 
Any other issues we are not aware of, please advise.
 
Outstanding known issues:
1) Unify custom reports (SQR) not working.  This was not part of integration test, but testing by Kelley Huntley on Friday resulted in failure.  Infrastructure expected to resolve by Monday noon.
2) There is some data setup that is being completed Monday morning and should be complete by now.
 
Any other issues we are not aware of, please advise.
 
Going forward:
1) The Netco EOL (or new OLT?) team will be testing all week deals into Netco environments.  You may see these in downstream systems.
2) Analysis of what estate data still resides in Netco, and what needs to be there to go forward.  Namely curve data for EnPower.
3) We will perform regression testing to determine if there are any cross dependency of hardware.  Testing scenarios include:
    a) Application messaging that use Tibco (port, multi-cast addresses)
    b) Estate execution with Netco hardware inactive
    c) Netco execution with Estate hardware inactive
 
Notice/ FYI - All Netco (UBS) employee's LAN NT user-id's will be changed to a new file server (anticipated Friday 02/01).  
The impacts are mainly the O:\ drive, W:\ drive will be split between Estate and Netco.  All authorized (legal) data is being copied now to the new file servers.
For example, if Netco employees need specific files on the O:\ drive, if they are missing, they would have remained with estate.  If you have files in progress, they
may missing the batch file copy which is occurring this week.
 
Updates to follow later this week!

Subject: Status report of integration testing from Wednesday, Jan. 23rd ; and Thursday's continuation..


 
Status report of integration testing from Wednesday, Jan. 23rd 
    - (16 gas/ power types of transactions to test)
 
Overall, there were no infrastructure or major application issues.  Unlike the prior testing, we've included many more gas transaction types and testing with all non-essential Netco data removed (aka baseline for Netco go-live). 
 
In today's test, we had numerous data setup related issues  that resulted in downtime (ie EOL- Dynegy information, TGP address information, bad credit counterparty/ contracts,  or database issues with data sync/ replication).   These were mainly attributed to the massive cleanup/ removal of data not needed.  The  remaining issues open are being addressed Wednesday night.  
 
Given the deferred 12:00pm to 2:00pm start time and data setup/ sync issues, we were unable to complete downstream processes (mainly Settlements, confirmations, SAP). 
 
Continuation of testing into Thursday
We are requesting the testers with tasks remaining to complete the script execution Thursday (morning shift and afternoon shifts given UBS offsite meetings).
We will try to balance the testing activities given some will be out in the morning, and some in the afternoon.  The bridgeline will be active from 9 - 5 for communication/ status.
 
 
RECAP of where testing left off for Netco and EOL entry. 
 
---> NETCO Deal types (with Netco external gas/power (good & bad credit)
Financial    All financial testing completed!
 
Power
Wednesday       
    - Completed tasks:  Deal Entry, settlement statement group setup, notification, EnPower deal load.  Awaiting settlements drafting issue.
Thursday (remaining & status)
    (1)  DCAF testing ready
    (2) Kelley Huntley to draft invoices after draft issue resolved.
 
Gas
Wednesday
    - Completed tasks:  Deal Entry in TDS, TAGG/ ERMS, Sitara.  Port Calc
 
Thursday
    - (Chris Spears) - Transport - The TGP payment methods are now setup.
    - (Clarissa Hanks)  - Transport usage ticket for generic contract is setup (Deal 20000082)
    - ( Wade Price) - To draft invoices after confirmation of activity upstream (pm)
    - DCAF testing after confirmation of activity upstream 
    - Need to conduct the EDI test (Tammy Jaquet/ Robert Virnau)
 
---> EOL Deals (Dawn Kenne has confirmed 4 EOL deals were setup.  2 Gas, 2 Power) 
 
Thursday's plans are to confirm the flow of these deals into  Sitara, Tagg/ EnPower. Followed by eventual confirmations, settlement through Unify and SAP.  These are ready now for validation by Sitara/ Tagg/ EnPower.
 
Thanks to your continued involvement ...
