Eddie,

Thanks for the note. This has been a very scary and tough time, but I'm
hoping something good can come from it. We are trying very hard to sell
the trading operation intact to several institutions. I'm sure you have
read about it. After the suffering you and all the other people who live
and work in the NYC financial district have gone through this year, this
pales in comparision. We're all hangin' tough.

Best wishes in this holiday season to and your family,
your friend
Andy
