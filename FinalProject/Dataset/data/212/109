Write Stuff
	
It takes more than water and flame retardant to put out forest fires. Reader and firefighter Paul F. tells us how his Visor Prism helped rescue a crewmember and keep the flames at bay.

Jump in the Fire
	
I am a smokejumper for the US Forest Service <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.2342.11693.46460.5127.233.34125625> in Missoula, Montana. (For those who may not know, smokejumpers are airborne, forest fire fighters that parachute into remote mountainous terrain to fight wild fires). As a Foreman for the Missoula Smokejumpers I manage several programs and coordinate several projects. My Visor helps me to stay on top of all that administrative work; but more unique is how it helps me on fires. My Prism was particularly helpful on one fire this last summer.

	
  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0090/final/images/012802parachute.jpg>We had a late afternoon dispatch to the Gallatin National Forest just north of Yellowstone National Park in early August-another lightning ignited fire. We were flying over the scene about one hour after receiving the call. As the airplane circled the fire I noticed a couple of small spot fires quite a distance from the main fire. I had my Prism out with the Magellan GPS <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.2342.11693.46460.5128.233.34125625> Module installed so I quickly marked a couple of waypoints as we flew over the spots. Within a few minutes we were leaping out of the aircraft and floating down to our jump spot about a half mile from the fire. Unfortunately one of our fellow crewmembers was hurt on landing, and because no helicopter ambulances were available in the area, we were forced to utilize the Malmstrom Air Force air rescue helicopter about four hours away. With my Prism and GPS unit I was able to gather the latitude and longitude coordinates of our location. I had the phone number for the 40th Air Rescue Squadron in my address book and thus was able to call them up direct on our satellite phone and arrange for the evacuation of the injured jumper-giving them all the pertinent information, including our location.
	
The next day I grabbed pictures of the fire with my eyemodule2 <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.2342.11693.46460.5129.233.34125625>. The fire made some impressive runs as the day warmed up making for some dandy photo opportunities but making for tough firefighting. Luckily, with some fast action and hard work on our part, we were able to get the fire under control as the evening cooled. The pictures I captured with the eyemodule2 helped to make a very complete fire report at the end of the fire.

The next morning (Day 3) I again used the GPS. We had been unable to find the spots we'd seen from the airplane by gridding for them, as they were no longer showing any smoke. However, I was able to locate the spot fires that I had marked as waypoints from the air. And it was a good thing too! Two of the spots still had hot embers in them, and thus had potential to kick up and burn.

Well, as you can see, a Handspring Visor Prism can be a pretty useful tool, even in some pretty unlikely places. All that, and I could even play Solitaire when we got a chance to kick back and take a break!!

So many numbers-so little time.

Write Stuff
	
It takes more than water and flame retardant to put out forest fires. Reader and firefighter Paul F. tells us how his Visor Prism helped rescue a crewmember and keep the flames at bay.

Jump in the Fire
	
I am a smokejumper for the US Forest Service <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.2342.11693.46460.5127.233.34125625> in Missoula, Montana. (For those who may not know, smokejumpers are airborne, forest fire fighters that parachute into remote mountainous terrain to fight wild fires). As a Foreman for the Missoula Smokejumpers I manage several programs and coordinate several projects. My Visor helps me to stay on top of all that administrative work; but more unique is how it helps me on fires. My Prism was particularly helpful on one fire this last summer.

	
  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0090/final/images/012802parachute.jpg>We had a late afternoon dispatch to the Gallatin National Forest just north of Yellowstone National Park in early August-another lightning ignited fire. We were flying over the scene about one hour after receiving the call. As the airplane circled the fire I noticed a couple of small spot fires quite a distance from the main fire. I had my Prism out with the Magellan GPS <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.2342.11693.46460.5128.233.34125625> Module installed so I quickly marked a couple of waypoints as we flew over the spots. Within a few minutes we were leaping out of the aircraft and floating down to our jump spot about a half mile from the fire. Unfortunately one of our fellow crewmembers was hurt on landing, and because no helicopter ambulances were available in the area, we were forced to utilize the Malmstrom Air Force air rescue helicopter about four hours away. With my Prism and GPS unit I was able to gather the latitude and longitude coordinates of our location. I had the phone number for the 40th Air Rescue Squadron in my address book and thus was able to call them up direct on our satellite phone and arrange for the evacuation of the injured jumper-giving them all the pertinent information, including our location.
	
The next day I grabbed pictures of the fire with my eyemodule2 <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.2342.11693.46460.5129.233.34125625>. The fire made some impressive runs as the day warmed up making for some dandy photo opportunities but making for tough firefighting. Luckily, with some fast action and hard work on our part, we were able to get the fire under control as the evening cooled. The pictures I captured with the eyemodule2 helped to make a very complete fire report at the end of the fire.

The next morning (Day 3) I again used the GPS. We had been unable to find the spots we'd seen from the airplane by gridding for them, as they were no longer showing any smoke. However, I was able to locate the spot fires that I had marked as waypoints from the air. And it was a good thing too! Two of the spots still had hot embers in them, and thus had potential to kick up and burn.

Well, as you can see, a Handspring Visor Prism can be a pretty useful tool, even in some pretty unlikely places. All that, and I could even play Solitaire when we got a chance to kick back and take a break!!
