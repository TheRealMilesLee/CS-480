Mike , 
 
If there are any power traders that did not sign on with UBS. Please pass this on . 
 
Progress Energy in North Carolina is embarking upon a major expansion of it's trading floor . They have hired an excellent SVP and are offering excellent growth opportunities for power traders . Traders with 2-4 years experience can move up to desk heads . Desk heads can move into more senior management roles . Let me know if you have any interest . Any recommendation you might have would be greatly appreciated .
