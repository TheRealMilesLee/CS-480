PROS Revenue Management Announces Profit Optimization Web Seminar for Marketing and Trading

 
January 22, 2002-Houston- PROS Revenue Management, the world's leader in pricing and revenue optimization science and software, invites you to attend PROS Energy Profit Optimization Web Seminar on Thursday, February 7, 2002. 
o        PROS Trading Optimization System: 3:00pm to 4:00pm Central Time  
The PROS Trading Optimization System utilizes PROS network optimization technology to optimally schedule natural gas volumes to market across multiple pipelines and provide buy/sell recommendations that maximize the revenue and utilization from all transportation assets.  In addition to the 10-15% profitability lift from optimal gas scheduling, the system also completely automates the scheduling process.  The PROS Trading Optimization System has been in live use since 2000.  Version 2.0 of the TOS system has been completely parameterized allowing companies to dynamically configure the system for multiple unique pipeline trading strategies and tariffs.
A Wall Street analyst was quoted: "By 2002, companies that neglect to implement revenue optimization techniques will become uncompetitive."  PROS Revenue Management solutions have been credited with delivering 6-8% incremental revenue and 20-100% incremental profits.   This Web seminar will allow industry leaders from the energy industry to learn from the experience PROS has gained in over 17 years of deploying these solutions.
The Web format for the seminar will allow participants to attend from remote locations, ask questions in real-time, and interact with the presenter through an Internet browser and toll-free telephone number.
