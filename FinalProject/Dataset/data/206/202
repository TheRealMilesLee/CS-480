I missed you getting up with me too, but that's ok you needed to get some rest. Only a little while longer and I won't have to go anymore.

I probably won't leave tonight until 5:30 or so, so if you get done I would love for you to come to the grotto before we go get Cal and Marion.

Last night was very very wonderful. Being with you, hanging out with you, it all just keeps getting better and better. I love you.

I hope your meeting was a good one. I can't wait to hear all about it. 

I love you so much. I can't wait to see you tonight Ms. Freeland. :-)

Good Morning Honey, 

I wish that I could have pulled it together enough to get up with you and take care of you this morning, I really missed that.  Thank you for waking me up and giving me kisses and love. It was a sweet way to start the day.

Today there is a meeting from UBS, in about 10 minutes. I wonder what will be said. I will let you know everything. 

On the way to work I was thinking about us planning for our home. I love the sound of our home. I hated seeing all of your stuff packed away today, I like snuggling with your pillows when you have gone to work. Soon we will both just be home.

Hopefully I will be all done with my bullshit in time to meet you at the grotto before going to Stanfords, but if not I will meet you there at 6. If I make it to the grotto by 5, will that be enough time for you to pick them up as well?

I am calling the doctor when his office opens to complain about the medication. I hope he gives me some more meds, but he might tell me just to hang in there until the new lower level is stabilized.

Last night was wonderful, each time we are together I find something new to enjoy. I love being with you, holding you and feeling all of your touches and caresses. You make me so happy, and I want to make you happy. I love that little grin on your face and the tenderness in your eyes. You are a wonderful man and I am the luckiest woman in the world to have you in my life.

I love you, 

Cara
