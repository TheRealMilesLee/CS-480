An important meeting  will be held tommorrow for all employees who

1) have accepted offers 
2) intend to accept offers ( to the best of their knowledge) but who have issues that need to be resolved

All employees in these categories should attend

Buses  will be provided for those who do not have their own transport and will pick up from the south side of the north building - please assemble in the Java plaza area from 8.30am  to 9.30am ( last bus @ 9.30 am )

The meeting will last until 1pm approximately and will be presented by senior managers from UBS on the firm and it's strategy.

There will be breakfast available at the Hotel from 9am to 10am and there will be sandwiches afterwards.  

If travelling independently please make sure you leave sufficient time to park (it will be very busy there ) and get to the Grand ballroom

Employees need to bring their id's or drivers licence with them to gain access to the meeting

I'm sorry for the short notice on this - please call out to anyone who should be attending who will not get this message in time
