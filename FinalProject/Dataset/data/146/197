The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

ADDITIONAL TIPS from Match.com:

Our anonymous re-mailer will strip away your real email address, so 
that it will NOT appear in the 'From:' line.

You may also contact this person from their Match.com profile by 
clicking 'Contact this person' and composing your message directly from the 
site.

However:

* Check to ensure that your email address is not in the BODY of your 
message as we are unable to remove these.

* Check to ensure that you REMOVE ANY AUTOMATIC SIGNATURE at the end of 

your email. And note that you cannot use 'Cc:' or 'Bcc:' if you want 
your email to remain anonymous.

Match.com does not monitor private email between members, nor are we
