Subject: [Footballguys] News Update - Anthony Thomas Downgraded to Doubtful

Entire story:   http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1123/1283244.html


Rookie Anthony Thomas, who has emerged as the Chicago Bears' top running
back this season, may miss Sunday's NFC Central clash against the Minnesota
Vikings.

Thomas, who has 638 rushing yards and four touchdowns, has been downgraded
to doubtful for Sunday's game with a strained right hamstring.

James Allen, a 1,000-yard rusher last season who lost his job to Thomas,
likely would start if Thomas is inactive for Sunday's game.

This is a crucial game for both teams. The Bears (7-2) need the victory to
stay ahead of the Packers in the Central, and the Vikings (4-5) need the win
simply to stay in the hunt for a playoff spot.

It's a dice roll here, folks.   He hasn't practiced all week and James Allen
has been working with the first team.   If you don't have anyone close to
Thomas' ability, you might roll the dice with him but if you've got another
option, I'd probably go with the safer route.   From Coach Dick Jauron's
eyes, I'm guessing he sees Allen as not a horrible choice plus the fact he
wants to get Allen healthy for the stretch run and playoffs.   Just my guess
though.

Joe
