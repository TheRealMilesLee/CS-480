There are files that back up the revenue projections that Steve Kleb gave me hard copies of for 2001 and 2002.  Can I get electronic copies of these, they have volumes and margins and appear to back up the revenue projections.   

2002 File looks like s\marketing\twfinmkt_anly\Tw\twfin\2001\misc\[plan_forecast_design.xls]\summary.  

2001 file looks like s\marketing\twfinmkt_anly\tw\twfin\2001\forecast-CE\[ce 3-2001.xls]model _source_data.    

If the same exists for 2000 can we get it as well.  I would like as soon as possible and you can email to the cc addresses as well.
