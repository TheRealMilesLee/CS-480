The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bul| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oil Be|t"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Millions per week.
Breaking NEws!!!
Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease opportunity in South Texas Providing opportunity 
for 22-Wel| Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large Recoverable Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing fie|d that was discovered and dri||ed by major oil companies 
in the 197Os.The field is estab|ished with substantial recoverab|e reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 million barrels of oi| and about 2 bi||ion cubic ft. of gas in the two pay zones.
Symbo| - EOGI
Price - .12
Se|l Target - .33 = Diamond P|ay
The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|l skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bul|
market in a generation.
2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.
3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-mi||ions, EOGI is se|ling for less than 1/4 the
value of its assets.
4. Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overall market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadrup|e returns.
Our subscribers need to pay particular|y c|ose attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This small company
with a comparab|y sma|| market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.
But al| that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa||y explosive
effect on
the share price.
What wi|l the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in
the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or decline
slight|y, you wil| stil| make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or
so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings will
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be
staggering.
Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wi|| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are well established and are going into massive production.
Early investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in this
area wi|| rea||y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu|letin.
