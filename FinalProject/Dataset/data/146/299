I just got back into town.  Looks like it was an interesting week.  Did you talk to Evans about this or should I call him Monday a.m.?

Richard, Andy, 

I'd appreciate a call on whether or not I should be releasing documents to AA, and if so, what, if any, process I should be going thru before doing so. 

Thanks
