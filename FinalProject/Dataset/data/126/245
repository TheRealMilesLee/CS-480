This is to provide clarification of the earlier message announcing 
the posting of Majority Accepted BP for WSCC New DP2 
(containing only Practices 10 and 17).  The full list of Business 
Practices with only BP #10 modified from the earlier version was 
posted for comment on August 1, 2001.  We received very few 
comments over the next 60 days. 

At its October 25-26 meeting, the OC agreed to have these two 
business practices posted, # 10 for an additional 60 days as only 
one comment was received relative to BP #10.  Other comments 
were related to items already approved by ISAS and OC vote.  
Business Practice # 17 is being offered for Due Process as 
requested by the OC (due to an OC member's request that WSCC 
become more consistent with NERC Policy 3 and the Eastern 
Interconnection).  Hence, the OC and ISAS Chairs are requesting 
comments about leaving #17 in the WSCC Business Practices or 
removing it all together.
