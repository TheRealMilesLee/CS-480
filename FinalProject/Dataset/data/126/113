Guys, given our continued need to be crisp and clear on our work product and a clear view to increasing efficiencies, particularily in the back and mid office, I think it would be a good exercise to clearly map out roles and responsibilities between ENW and the EES Services Group in some amount of detail.  Dan will take the lead in this activity.  I would hope that we could have this mapped out fairly quickly without a great deal of internal time.

Thanks for all the hard work.

Regards
Delainey
