Another question for Dave/Janet  --whether or not move Neil and family over here  -- I don't see another Gas Director available  -- even in a worst case scenario  -- unless you think some risk Directors will be coming out of EIM  --

I know the message is 'business as usual' but with some changes inevitable down the line, I'm just checking for all the people 'in the pipeline' for moves from overseas.....is it still a 'go' ?  

Please keep me in the loop if you think there may be changes to current plans for Neil's move.

Thanks

Jackie
