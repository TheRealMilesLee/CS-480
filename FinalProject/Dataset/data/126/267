Looking at Policy 3, version 5, draft 1, it reads:

1.2. Tagging. The PURCHASING-SELLING ENTITY serving the load shall be
responsible for
providing the INTERCHANGE TRANSACTION tag. (NOTE): 1) Any PSE may provide
the
tag; however, the load-serving PSE is responsible for ensuring that a single
tag is
provided. 2) If a PSE is not involved in the TRANSACTION, such as delivery
from a
jointly owned generator, then the SINK CONTROL AREA is responsible for
providing the
tag. PSEs must provide tags for all Interchange Transactions in accordance
with
Requirement 2.

NOTE 1) is the basis for the proposed change in WSCC Business Practice #10.


To the point, I seem to have missed past discussions regarding NOTE 2).
Please could someone provide some background on NOTE 2?  When does it apply
- under what scenarios, etc.?
