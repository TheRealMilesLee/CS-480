Mark,
Can you email me or fax me any written documentation we have give to Heidi in regard to performance.  I have her reviews but thought we did some other written documentation.  Let me know.  Thanks.

Have you heard anything from the HR lawyers regarding our ability to fire her in the near future for poor performance?
