St. Paul’s United Methodist Church 
Habitat for Humanity Project
  
November 19, 2001
  
OK, so maybe I was a bit optimistic . . . The work on the siding and soffits 
went very slowly, the plumbing was not completed, the paint for the second 
exterior coat did not arrive and the landscaping has been delayed.  According 
to Will Greenough, our construction manager from Habitat, his anticipated 
completion date of December 15 has slipped again to as late as mid January.  
Much of the delay is attributable to complications arising from the concrete 
construction, which made otherwise simple jobs very time consuming.  You 
should have seen the plumbers trying to drill through ten-inch concrete walls!
 
What all this means for us is that we have at least two more weekends of 
work.  If you are free on either November 24 or December 1, or both, please 
come out.  All of us find ourselves in the middle of crowded schedules this 
time of year, so anyone who can make the time to help, even for a half day, 
is very welcome.  We will continue on the siding and soffits, repainting and 
landscaping.  The going is slow, but the house can't be completed without it. 
 Let me know if you will be there so we can plan for food and drink.  We 
won't have van service on November 24, but we can arrange car pools from the 
church if there is any interest.
 
Thanks again to Ken Jones and Martha Cochrum for keeping us well fed.  Also 
to Jeanne Koch for keeping us safe (and not falling off the ladder) and to 
“chainsaw Felker” for not cutting anything but the trees.  Also to Allene 
Ford for her example of boundless energy and to our crew chiefs, including 
Bob Mahlstedt and Roger Fowler, for getting the job done.  Our site is full 
of the sense of warmth and family that makes St. Paul's such a special place 
for worship. For that, thank you all.
 
If you would like to help in acquiring the washer and dryer for the Franco’s, 
please make a check out to St. Paul’s and indicate that it is for Habitat on 
the memo line.  We received several generous gifts already to make this a 
reality.  You can either give the check to me or send it directly to the 
church.  I will send additional information on the dedication as we get 
closer.
 
Thank you all for your dedication.  If any of you have questions or comments, 
please feel free to respond by return email or call me at 713-748-3317.
 
Have a safe and happy Thanksgiving!
 
Les
