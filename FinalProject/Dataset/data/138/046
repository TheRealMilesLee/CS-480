As of 5:30 today, the EFM spot group had another record day.  123 loads, 288 transactions.

I talked to them this morning and reminded them that any value in the business will disappear unless they continue to grow volumes.  They hit it out of the park.

If you get the chance to stop by tomorrow and let them know you are paying attention I think that would do a lot for morale.  Keeping up activity in this atmosphere is remarkable, and they deserve some recognition.  The only upside for them at this point is being sold and getting Enron back part or all of its investment.

thanks,

dan
