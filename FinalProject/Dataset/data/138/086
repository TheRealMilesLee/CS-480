Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!  I really appreciate all you have done 
for me and I PROMISE, I won't let you down.  You'll be wondering how you 
ever managed without me.  Hope you guys are having a wonderful time in Vail. 
  Have a safe trip home and I guess I'll talk to you later this week.  Can 
hardly wait! :) Christina  303-674-8391
