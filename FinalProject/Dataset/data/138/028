Dear friend,

My name is ALLEN JOHNSON.I am a banker by profession,from 
Benin Republic in West Africa.I have the opportunity of 
transfering a left over fund which amounts to $14.3 
million USD,to any foreign account as the funds must be 
transfered outside Benin Republic for security reasons.

Hence,i am inviting you for a business deal where this 
money can be shared between us if you agree to my % 65:35 
proposal.

You can reply me on; allenjhs@yahoo.fr or call me on; +229 
095681
I am waiting for you.

Best regards.
ALLEN JOHNSON.
