I'm out (in SF) and off Wednesday. What's the status of the deal? Were we going to require them to get DOJ approval?

I can be reached by fax today and tomorrow at 415-383-1613.

Ben,

I need to get you to resign from the Montana Megawatts BOD.  Will you be in this week?  If not, we can handle it with fax/fed ex.

Please prepare a letter of resignation for Ben, leaving the date of the letter as November ___.  Thanks.
