Excellent memo.  It should come from you and Pushkar, to Zufferli, Lavorato, Hickerson, and me.

Thanks, and sorry you had to do this, but I think it will ultimately be very helpful.

Jeff

Jeff--

Please find attached a copy of the memo to John Zufferli regarding the recent forward transaction in US$/Cad$.  Gary has reviewed it, and I have incorporated his comments.  Please let me know if you would like any changes before I send it to him.
