This might be a surprise to you about where I got your contact address. Please I got your name and address through a commercial publication via Internet courtesy of S.A.I.E. during my desperate search for someone that could honestly and confidentially assist me by serving as my trustee.
I am the above named person from Tunisia but now undergoing medical treatment. 

I am married to Dr.Abdulmalik Daoud who worked with Malaysia embassy in Nigeria for nine years, before he died in the year 2002. We were both married for eleven years without a child. 

He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both Christians and since his death I decided not to re-marry outside my matrimonial home . When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$27.6Million (Twenty-seven Million six hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with a finance/security company in Europe.Presently, this money is still with the Finance/Security Company. 

Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Six months due to my cancer illness.Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to an individual or better still a God fearing person who will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want an individual that will use this to fund and provide succor to poor and indigent persons, establishment orphanage homes, and above all those affected in the Tsunami in far Asia.

I understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not inclined to helping poor persons and I do not 
want my husbands hard earned money to be misused or spent in the manner in which my late husband did not specify. I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Almighty. 

I do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health, and because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I do not want them to know about this development.
With God all things are possible. 

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Security/Finance House in UK. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original beneficiary of this fund,through 
my Lawyer. I want you to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life worthy of emulation. Whosoever that wants to serve the Almighty must serve him with all his heart and mind and soul and also in truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life.

Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for an individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act according to my specification herein. Hoping to hear from you. 

Thank you and may the Almighty bless you.

Mrs. Rebecca Abdumalik Daoud (Benefactor).
