Mike - does this include day trips from NYC to Conn. and NJ?  Limos in this instance I would think are appropriate.

Thanks,

George

George,

Jeff has just signed your expense account from last month.  It has been on hold because we have stopped approving all submitted reports that include car services (for all of EGM) that are outside of the direct airport to the hotel charges.  We have made statements to everyone via memo and our commitment to our bosses that we are watching our costs especially those like these specifically.  In most cities cabs or other shorter hires are available.  

We are not attempting to be cheap but we have put this is a hard rule and of course includes Jeff and me.  We haven't and will not do it either.  We don't want to discuss this further and it is not something we will think about again but we wanted to be clear.

Thanks,
Mike and Jeff
