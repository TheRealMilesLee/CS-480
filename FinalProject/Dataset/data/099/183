Hello Lizzette and Michelle,
I have attached the revised EEO policy, Harassment Prevention policy, related FAQ's for each policy, and the links (for all policies) for your review.  Please let me know if you have additional revisions or suggestions for these documents.

Thank you very much for your time and efforts.  I greatly appreciate it!
