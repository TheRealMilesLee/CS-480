You should complete the survey as if you are taking it.  there is an advance button at the bottom of the screen.  Let me know if you want me to walk you through it.

I did the first screen, which looked ok to me.  I couldn't get to other screens.  Michelle

Attached is the URL to test the questionnaire.  Please review the content for consistency.  I would like to complete any final changes today.  We will do our final/final walkthru at the hotel on Friday.   Once I clear the test responses, you will be live and will not want anyone going into the survey to play... 

Thanks...
