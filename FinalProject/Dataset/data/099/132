Subject: [Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Correction - Swayne to Start for Chrebet

Hi Folks,

Getting new information on the Wayne Chrebet situation.   Appears that
Rookie WR Kevin Swayne will get the start and not Matthew Hatchette.

Here's the story from Bloomberg:

East Rutherford, New Jersey, Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- New York Jets receiver
Wayne Chrebet and defensive tackle Shane Burton will miss this Sunday's game
against the Carolina Panthers because of injuries sustained in last
weekend's loss to St. Louis.

Chrebet has had migraine headaches following a hit to his head from
defensive tackle Brian Young in a 34-14 defeat this past Sunday. Chrebet,
who had a concussion the previous week against Miami, didn't sustain a
second concussion against the Rams, Jets coach Herman Edwards said.

Chrebet has started all six games this season and is fourthon the Jets with
15 catches for 226 yards. The seven-year National Football League veteran
had 69 catches for 937 yards and eight touchdowns last season.

With Chrebet out, Kevin Swayne will start along with Laveranues Coles when
the Jets (3-3) visit the Panthers (1-5) on Sunday. Swayne, an undrafted
rookie from Wayne State in Nebraska, has one catch for 16 yards this year.

I'd expect to see more than usual from Hatchette but it's Swayne who's been
backing up Chrebet.   Tough to expect the rookie to do a lot being thrust
into this situation so I wouldn't count on too much.   Sorry for the
confusion.

Thanks to Footballguy Matt Rosenthal for setting me straight.

Joe
