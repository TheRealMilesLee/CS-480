Jeff & Andy:

I spoke to Stevia and she stated (to my surprise) that TDC does not believe any further discovery is necessary, but they would like time to prepare a reply.  She is checking on the next available hearing dates and will set the motion for whichever date will give her sufficient time to prepare the reply.  i will keep you posted.

Robert
