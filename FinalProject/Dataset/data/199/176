Peter Swartz Joins EPIS as Vice President of Development

 
West Linn, Oregon, January 16, 2002 - EPIS, Inc., developer of the AURORAÔ Electric Market Model, announced that Peter J. Swartz has joined EPIS as Vice President of Development, with responsibility for the development of market modeling software as well as forecasting products and services.

The Power Planning Council is a four-state planning agency that oversees the regional energy and fish and wildlife interests in coordination with the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). As the principal author of the Council's power system planning and decision analysis models, he spearheaded the application of these tools to issues concerning resource economics and reliability in the Northwest power system, including the treatment of planning under uncertainty. Mr. Swartz has pioneered analytical models to examine the tradeoffs between system operation policy and effects on fish and wildlife constraints. 
 
"EPIS has grown significantly over the last three years. Our success in large measure is to due to timely development of modeling capabilities, and we are committed to continuing to meet our clients' energy forecasting needs for 2002 and beyond," said Warren Winter, EPIS President. "We are pleased that an individual with Peter Swartz's experience is joining our management team. Mr. Swartz has more than 20 years of experience in power system modeling and analysis and will be a great asset to our continued growth and success." 
 
"Not only does he bring strong model development capabilities, he also brings a wealth of background in energy policy and extensive analysis on energy issues, including the bulk power markets," Winter said.
 
Mr. Swartz also has provided consulting services to the water industry, developing water supply planning models for use in the analysis of supply, transmission, and conservation alternatives. Prior to 1982, he spent three years at Portland General Electric (PGE) in financial and resource planning.  Also, has taught management science and statistics at the School of Business Oregon State University. 
 
Swartz earned a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from Oregon State University in 1976, and he earned an MBA with high honors in 1977 with emphasis in management science and operations research.

The company is the developer of the AURORA electric market model, uses AURORA to produce market forecasts, and supports clients who use the model to forecast and analyze the energy marketplace.
