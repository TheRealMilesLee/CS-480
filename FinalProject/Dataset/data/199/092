Susan,

I'm delivering copies of the attached netting agreements.  Please note that I'm waiting to hear back from Credit and Accounting to confirm that I've listed all the existing netting agreements.  Hopefully they will also be able to provide us with copies of fully executed agreements.  I will update the list as soon as I hear from them.

Thanks,

Nony
