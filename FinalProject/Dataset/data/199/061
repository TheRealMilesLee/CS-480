	Extended forecast for the Tuesday 01/22/02, highs 32 - lows 15.   Gave Phil the go a head for his outage.   Spoke with Jim Merrick on the Owatonna team to inform him of this outage.   He informed me that the unit's breaker is locked-out, and if the unit is needed a call-out will have to be made.
                                                         Thanks

	Received a call from Peoples Co-op Service today and spoke with Phil Swenson (507-288-4004).   He informed me that there will be an outage of electrical power to Chatfield Compressor Station on 01/22/02 @ 0800 to 1600.   Phil would like to receive a call back to proceed with the outage so he can schedule it with the electric suppler.

                                                                        Thanks
