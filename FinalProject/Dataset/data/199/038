Hello Lindy Lou! How are you doing? Are you holding up? I was so glad to talk with you about how things were affecting you. You amaze me in how you are so objective and practical about the whole thing. Your concern is not for yourself but others who are older have less time before retirement. You are so thoughtful. But I have known that. I was sorry you felt so bad about the Company. You have worked for a great company that has been successful and good for the country let alone the oil market economy. This mismanagement is not a reflection on all the very very hard working honorable people who made the company what it is today. Like you and 99.9999% of the people involved. I just wanted to tell you I love you and was thinking about you today. I took Claire to get tested for allergies today. What a sad thing they poked her 18 times. She is allergic to cats and has a propensity to be allergic to the hampsters we have so the doc limited her contact with them. The cat allergy is!
 a problem because our sitter who watches her 3-4 afternoons a week has a cat. This lady-Carol is a Godsend. I think Claire's own grandparents couldn't care for her as good as this lady. She is like a member of the family. So, I don't know what we'll do about the allergy situation. You know how hard it is to find someone you trust to care for your child. I told Claire we could go anywhere for lunch since she was crying with the "multiple Pokes" to her skin and then I got paged to Adam's school that he had a fever and wanted to come home. So, I am in the Mommie mode today. Somedays I think it would be good to be home all the time. But, we'd have to move. Well, I'm just rambling on-imagine that! I hope you have a good day! Write back and let me know how Sam, Tony, Missy, Andrew, Anthony and of course YOU are! 
L/Y/L/A/S Holly Louise
