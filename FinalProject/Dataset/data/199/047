I thought of a couple other TW applications that I can access thru the Internet.
My access should be removed for TW but not for NNG.

Flowing Gas Invoices & related documents under www.tw.enron.com (or www.hottap.enron.com) - Customer Activities - Invoices
(This may one may have lapsed by now.)

ENVISION for TW Contracts & Invoices (but I need to keep ENVISION access to NNG Contracts & Invoices)

637 Transactional Reports/Administration Screen at x12.enron.com/ebbadmin  (used to edit Trans reports before posting to Internet).
Again, I still need access to NNG reports, but not TW.

Since Omaha Regulatory Affairs is no longer handling TW business, please cancel my ability to access the following:

1.  Read/Update access to TW's CBS system.
2.  Access to the twadhoc database on the etsadhoc server.  (However, I do still need access to the nngadhoc & etsadhoc databases on the same etsadhoc server.)
3.  TW-only Universes in Business Objects.  (I still need access to non-TW universes.)

My usercode in all cases is "rbianchi".

(Am I supposed to submit something thru E-Request on this?)
