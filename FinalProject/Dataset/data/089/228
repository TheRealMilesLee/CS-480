I attended a small fundraising dinner last night for Chairman Max Baucus.  At the event, I had a long conversation with the government affairs head of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation.  As you may recall, the Pequot literally created the enterprise of Indian gaming.  The Pequot's make Bill Gates look like a pauper, as they are worth billions.  Their annual gaming revenue exceeds $1B.  They also own golf courses, ferry services and mail-order pharmaceutical discount networks.  They very much want to talk to Enron about energy investments.  They believe using Indian lands for energy investments stands to be as lucrative as gaming has been for them.  I don't know if this is a pipedream, but they are serious players.  How should we proceed?  They very much want to talk with us.  Should you and I meet with them next week in DC as an intro meeting?  I'd love government affairs to get credit, if there is anything here.  Thanks
