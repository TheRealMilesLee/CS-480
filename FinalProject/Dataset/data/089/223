Donna, as per voicemail... thanks for the outline.  Just want to make sure that we coordinate this protest as i asked Kerry to look at this a couple of weeks back.  Kerry has already been through it and has extensive notes on most sections...he has also sent a couple of the detailed protocols to me for review.  

If have a feeling that your email duplicates some of those efforts so I apologise for not coordinating with you as well but suggest that Kerry is in the best position to bring the protest together with assistance from you and i.

regards
Mike

Attached are some notes about the Translink filing.  Kerry and I  were on a call with the Midwest Coalition.  Because Enron had filed a protest in the DTE/ITC case, we were asked to take a look at it.  This is very preliminary and we need to review the multi-volume filing further.  Comments are due October 29.  I propose that we file comments in this case similar to the position we took in the DTE case.

Mike and Kerry,
Perhaps we can divide up the multi-volumes and you can let me know if I have the gist of an Enron position in the outline.  Mike, can you take a look at the CMS since it is unclear if they are proposing the ability to retain their own or if they will commit to joining MISO on Day 2.
