FYI  -- the Master Workplan is now being maintained in Excel.  The file name is o:\corporate\tax\Master Workplan Post September Close.  Please note, this file can not be filtered or sorted.  So, Vicsandra created another file that can be sorted.  The sortable file can be located at o:\corporate\tax\Master Workplan Post September Close -FilterSorting.

Thanks,
  Caroline

The Master Workplan is now available.  The backup workplan (used for filtering/sorting) will be available by 11:00am. 

I will be performing further updates tomorrow morning from 7am-9am and the workplan will again be unavailable during that time.

RANKINGS - There are numerous entities that have not been ranked.  Please update this information as soon as possible.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks again for everyone's cooperation,
