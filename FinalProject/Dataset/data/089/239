Yes we would watch the game!  And celebrate a longhorn victory!  Good luck finding a decent place to stay. How much do you want to spend?  The driskol hotel on 6th street is great and the 4 seasons is wonderful. Not quite as much $$ is the omni (downtown), hyatt on the lake or sherton. I think there's a marriott down town too. 

I'd say call me on sunday but I know your aversion to the phone. Have fun. Think of me once or twice.
