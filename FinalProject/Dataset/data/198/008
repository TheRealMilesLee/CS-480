THANKS again for taking time to assist me last night.  I told Danny that I am set up and how cool it works.  Since you are on a roll.  Can I have the printer that is in EB1339? (John Goodpasture's office)  It is a small HP printer?  The Enron Wind people are scheduled to move in tomorrow night and I am afraid that the printer will disappear.
