Thanks for the email.  In connection with this transmission agreement, a
business decision needs to be made as to whether EPMI can realize value
from it.  That depends on what EPMI's long term needs for the transmission
are?  It is very risky to assume a 13.5 year deal if EPMI only needs the
transmission for the next year because once EPMI assumes the contract, all
payment obligations under that contract are postpetition, administrative
claims.

If EPMI can find a good buyer for this contract, the EPMI can assume and
assign the contract and realize the value through the consideration paid by
the buyer for the contract.

I understand that PGE may want us to assume or reject promptly, but with
this kind of contract, we need sufficient time to allow the business plan
to be fully developed and a firm understanding of what EPMI's long term
needs are going to be.

I hope this helps.  Thanks.

I spoke last evening with Rich George, a lawyer at Portland General
Electric.  He said that EPMI needs to make sure that it only pays the
post-petition part of the Dec transmission services invoice (received by
EPMI on 1/2/02).  Apparently, this bill had Dec 1-2 (pre-petition)
separated.  I understand that Steve Thome is retrieving the bill to make
sure that EPMI pays only the post-petition amount (bill is in line to be
paid this Friday).

Rich understands that EPMI is not going to pay the pre-petition at this
time and said that PGE is not planning to curtail EPMI's transmission.
However, he asked that EPMI consider accepting or rejecting the
transmission agreement in bankruptcy court fairly soon.  MELANIE -- Can you
please let us know what to do in this regard?  This is a Long Term (13.5
years remaining) electric transmission agreement with an estimated in the
money value to EPMI of $5 mill.  EPMI would consider transferring it or
possibly holding it for its value.  Thanks.
