Kids and I went out Saturday for first flight in +10 years only to have to
abort due to mid time student landing in front of us flipping a new 172
over.  I did not see the flip, but it looks like he ran off the runway and
the nose wheel caught in the ditch and he went over.  No one was hurt, but
the plane is probably a write off.

We made it on Sunday.  Normal stalls, steep turns, touch and goes.  I
probably have 1 or 2 more rides to make sure it wasn't a fluke, but we
should soon be able to go for the famous $100 hamburger or $200 burger if we
get it at Dennis's.

Also training the kids about planes.  We started with, don't touch unless I
say okay and don't walk around props.  We made a choice of not giving them
headphones so we could have quiet on the intercom, but we forgot to tell
Power not to talk on final unless there was a collision pending.  He also
commented we forgot to tell him about the stalls but Marydith like them.  I
curious how much of his PC flying will translate to the real thing when he
can ride copilot.
