Kam, 

I am not sure if Anne Bike is still with Enron, but this email could not be delivered to her. Can you look at the email below and let me know if it is something you can help me with?

Thanks,
Genaro

Anne,

For Nov. 2001, ENA billed Northwest Natural Gas for demand charges on deal # 992523 and deal # 967236. The total amount for each deal was $127,500.00 (300,000 @ $.425). The customer paid for only one of the deals. Do you know if both deals are valid and the customer is responsible for paying both? (Note: the comments on deal # 967236 state - seller's choice, if gas is delivered @ Caly Basin use # 992523.) Please advise.

Thanks,
Genaro
