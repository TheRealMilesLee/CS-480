details, but in summary,the funds are coming via a swift security firm,whose name is withheld for now due to obvious reasons and pending when we open communication. 

This is a legitimate transaction.My client is willing to pay 10% [US$5 Million] for your partnership and "management fees".

If you have the interest to assist,please write me back by 
email:j_ofor005@terra.com.mx, and provide me with your confidential telephone number,fax number and private email address .As soon as I have these,I will provide further details and instructions.

problems/scandals.Also, note that this project must be concluded within the shortest possible time.Please write back promptly.I will also suggest you visit this news site on the internet to be better informed about this project.
