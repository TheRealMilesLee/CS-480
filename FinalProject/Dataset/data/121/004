Tim,

Ted Noble works on the weather desk.  Is there any sensitivity in providing him with this information?

Jim,

How the mighty bruins have fallen.  Too bad because I thought the National Championship game was within reach.  Oh well. 

The weather desk gas gone through a fundamental transformation and has attempted to align itself with the gas and power desks.  Dave Kistler (origination) and I (mid-markets) are getting ourselves organized and we need your help.  We would like to get a West Power org chart and if possible a list of your desk's counterparties (we do not want to interfere with your relationships and weather derivatives may be an additional product to sell to your customers).  If you could help us out with this, that would be great.  Thanks and hopefully I will get out there soon to meet the people and provide a little more clarity to what we are doing and how we can add value to you.

Ted
