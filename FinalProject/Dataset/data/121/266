No new details to report.  Same settlement to unbundle socal that's been before the commission for about a year.  On the commission's agenda to consider, but as has been the case for over year, they've delayed any movement--at least one commissioner doesn't like competition and has the discretion to continue to ask that it be delayed.  Some hold the view that there's a push to try to get it moved, but best guess is 50-50 at this point.  Substantively, though, same thing that's been before them for a very long time, i.e., emulate PG&E's gas accord (more or less) on socal.

Best,
Jeff

I am reading an article in NGI that talks about how California Regulator's are scheduled to approve some form of unbundling on Socal's system.  Please provide details of this as soon as it happens.  Thank you.
