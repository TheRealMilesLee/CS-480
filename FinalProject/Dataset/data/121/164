Hey
The amt of info we get is even worse as fred usually calls with updates and since u know noothing - we know less. I will check into your thoughts and get back to u. Heading to toronto to see family- my brother is home fromjapan. I will get georgie to call you - he is pretty tapped into it all - what number shud he call you on - heightened state of awareness down there with the flow of info - will call ltr to explain - I think afraid of mass exodus
Spk soon and take care- if I hear anything (other than what is on CNBC !!) I will let you know....
