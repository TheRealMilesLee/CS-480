Cara worked evenings with me Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.  She has done well learning the evening routine.  She has taken lots of notes and seems to understand what needs to be done.  The area she still has concerns with is: El Paso - when is it a loop and when is it going to or from TW.  So be sure to let her know if there are any.

I let her do everything Saturday evening and with the exception of a couple of questions, she soloed.  I feel she will do fine on evenings starting Wednesday, the 26th.   

Randy
