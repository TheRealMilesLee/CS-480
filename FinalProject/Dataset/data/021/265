Rick, as you are likely aware, Ontario market opening has once again been pushed back with March 2002 likely the earliest possible start. From a strategic standpoint, you will recall that we decided to align our interests with the outcome of the OEB/IMO readiness report due out in September. Our regulatory position was that it was highly likely that the outcome of this report would be positive and by supporting this initiative it would push the government to immediately open the market (likely November 2001). In the interim however, the OEB has unilaterally deferred market opening to 2002 with the deferral of stage 2 of the self-certification process from August to December. 

In my mind, we actually gave credence to the OEB and to some extent gave them the mandate to defer market opening. Lets discuss when you have a moment.

Regards
Rob

On Alex or possible Paul.

It seemed like we were way off base in predicting what would come out in the recent report re. readiness.  Who missed this.
