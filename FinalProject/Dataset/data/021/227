Jason,

I was looking for some feedback to pass a long to my contact at Cinergy Canada Inc. regarding their ability to trade online.  Is there anyway we can give them a small line.  

Thanks,

Jon

Randy,

Could you please prepare a credit sheet for a master physical contract between ECC and Cinergy Canada Inc.  Cinergy Canada Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cinergy Marketing and Trade.  Your contact person is David Livingston at p(713) 393 - 6852, f(713) 890 - 3122.

Also, could you please give me credit clearance for Cinergy Canada to trade shorter term products on Enrononline under our GTC.

Regards,

Jon
