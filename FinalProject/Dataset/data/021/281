She tendered her resignation this morning.  Intends to sit out for noncompete period.  Don't think that she has secured a new job yet, but will likely show up with Calpine or AEP in Portland sometime in Q4.  Probably has a verbal commitment from Wolfe to work with him wherever he lands.  Haven't had exit interview yet.  Most likely leaving due to money.  Hate to lose her, but Foster and Swerzbin are ok with it.

I will call Wolfe today and tell him about Holli and directly ask him if he is leaving based on this new information.
