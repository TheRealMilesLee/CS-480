Please review the following information on the N-form project objectives: 

As a result of our July 30 meeting, the following determinations and next steps can be reported: 
The HR Policy - title-topic-basis presentation was reviewed and revised for the presentation to HR leadership.  Michelle indicates the subject and issues were well received and the next steps seem in-line with objectives and expectations.  
Consolidated Narratives Document was reviewed and discussed. In the view of participants, the following issues remain to be clarified.
	1.	Enron Compliance Officer is incorrectly identified in current HR Policy. - Sharon indicated that Enron's Compliance Officer, by resolution of the Board is the 		Chairman of the 	Board of Directors of Enron Corp.  
	2.	Policy Narrative # 5 Hours of Work, Holidays and Vacations - (We want a better title for this subject array) On the issue of Vacation - Accrual, tax, and 		accounting issues need to be clearly reviewed.  Is the current desired state known; who can articulate the desired state for vacation accrual (month to 		month) and identify organizational impacts of the proposed change? What are the implications for year end carry over, utilization of yet to be accrued 			vacation time?  Before the issue narrative can be crafted, we need to firm up our vacation policy and procedural objectives. Is year end implementation a 		viable objectives?  
	3.	Time off and Leaves of Absence (We want a better title for this subject array)  
			A.	Sick Plan needs to be evaluated for impact and potential changes - We have addressed the influence of FMLA running concurrent to sick 				leave. The participants questioned the practical implications and logistics of a concurrent utilization procedure,  We have not 						discussed/reviewed this aspect as yet.  How will this change impact the organization, its employees, or management?
			B.	Funeral or Bereavement - Contemplatng changes to the "member of family" criteria:  Group in attendance suggests that domestic partners, 				members of household, non-custodial parent of child in home, as well as aunt/uncle for addition to "family" criteria.  Another 						consideration involves death of a co-worker or retiree from Enron work / peer group.  Should we formalize procedures to define pay status for 				leave for pallbearers or time away to attend co-worker / retiree funerals?
	4.	Educational Assistance:  Policy is presented at 100% reimbursements.  This seems acceptable as long as the emphasis is on approved course work.  
		Issue to contemplate and address:   Is there any need, desire or value to be gained from a graduated reimbursements rate? I.E. 100% for a "A" grade, 85% 		for a "B", 70 % for a "C" 

Please review and respond to issues 1 through 4: distribute your response to the entire group so everyone benefits from the insights being developed.

Other N-Form project developments: 	These specific next steps were identified and assigned.
	N-Form Links -  Rick will develop Associate Bonus project plan for creating the N-Form resources information and for deploying the policy presentation and links 	on the intra-net.  Request for A&A volunteers was distributed - Briefing and Tasking meeting tentatively set for August 23.
	Promotion and presentation concept planning to begin.  Diane Goode has tentatively volunteered to assist with this effort.  

Please anticipate continued information, revisions, and updates as we formalize the next phase of work.  Thank you, Looking forward to your comments and ideas. 
Regards; Rj.
