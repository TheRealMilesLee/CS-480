Dear Partner,

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.

Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this
transaction.

This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and "TOP
SECRET" Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make
anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be
well at the end of the day. We have decided to contact you first by
your email due to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been
reliably informed that it will take at least two to three weeks for a
normal post to reach you. So we decided it is best using the email.

Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you. I am Mr.
Nelson Brown, a senior official in the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation and I head a Three-man tender board in charge of Contracts
Awards and payment Approvals. I came to know of you in my search for a
reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business
transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a
foreign account requiring maximum confidence. I and my colleagues are
top officials of the Federal Government Contract Review Panel.

Our duties include evaluation, vetting, approval for payment of
contract jobs done for the NNPC, etc. In order to commence this
business, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your
account the said funds.

The source of these funds is as follows: During the last military
regime here in Nigeria, this committee awarded a contract of
US$400,000,000.00 (Four Hundred Million United States Dollars) to five
construction firms on behalf of the Petroleum Ministry for the supply,
construction and installation of Oil Pipeline from Warri to Port
Harcourt. During this process my colleagues and I decided amongst
ourselves to deliberately over-inflate the total contract sum to
US$431,500,000.00 (Four Hundred and Thirty One Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars) with the main intention of sharing the
remaining sum of US$31,500,000.00 (Thirty One Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars) amongst ourselves.

The Federal Government of Nigeria has sinceapproved the sum of
US$431,500,000.00(Four Hundred and Thirty OneMillion, Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars) for us as thecontract sum, and the sum
of US$ 400,000,000.00 (Four Hundred Million United States Dollars) has
also been paid to the foreign contractors concerned as contract
entitlements for the contract done, but since each of the companies is
entitled to US$80,000,000.00 only, we are now left with US$31,500,000.00
balance in the account which we intend to transfer abroad into a safe
and reliable account to be disbursed amongst ourselves, but by virtue of
our positions as civil servants and members of this panel, we cannot do
this by ourselves,as we are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau
(Civil Service Laws) from opening /operating foreign accounts in our
names, making it impossible for us to acquire the money in our names.

I have, therefore, been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues
in the panel to look for an overseas partner into whose account we would
transfer the sum of US$31,500,000.00 (Thirty One Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars), hence we are writing you this letter.

My colleagues and I have agreed that if your company can act as the
Beneficiary of these funds on our behalf, you or your company will
retain 30 of the total amount of US$31,500,000.00 (Thirty One Million
Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 60 will be for us
(members of this panel) and the remaining 10 will be used in offsetting
all debts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in the cause of
this transfer.

Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous.
In return we demand your complete honesty and trust. You must however,

NOTE that this transaction will be strictly based on the following
terms and conditions as we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed
cases of business associates running away with funds kept in their
custody when it finally arrive their accounts. A very good and recent
example is the one of Mr. Peter Hopwood, the President of Mileage
Trading and Investment Company at Number 121, West 55th Street, 21st
Floor, New York 10022, and former Chairman of OMPADEC (Mr.Patrick Opia),
who we were reliably informed that after the agreement between both
partners in which he was to take 15 of the money,While the remaining 85
for Nigerian Officials. 

With all the required documents signed, the money was duly transferred
into his account, only to be disappointed on their arrival in New York
and were informed that Mr. Peter Hopwood was no longer on that address,
while his telephone and fax numbers have been re-allocated to somebody else.

This was how they lost US$18.5 Million to Mr. Hopwood. This is a very
recent story here in my country and everybody is aware of this, some of
the officials decided to cry out and face the law, because they felt
they had lost too much to a stranger, while the Chairman of OMPADEC
(Mr. Patrick Opia) is hiding in a foreign country. So right now we are
taking all precautionary measures to guard against re-occurrence of such
act in our case. 

This is why we have decided that this transaction will be based
completely on the following:

(a).Our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence.

(b).That you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and
confidentiality.

(c).That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly release our
share (60) on demand after you have removed your 30 and all expenses
have been settled.

(d).You must be ready to produce us with enough information about
yourself to put our minds at rest.

Please, note that this transaction is 100 legal and risk free and we
hope to conclude the business in Seven Bank working days from the date
of receipt of the necessary information and requirement from
you.Please,acknowledge the receipt of this letter by replying me back.

I will bring you into the complete picture of the transaction when I
have heard from you.

Your urgent response will be highly appreciated please
Thank you and God bless.

Yours faithfully,

Mr. Nelson Brown
