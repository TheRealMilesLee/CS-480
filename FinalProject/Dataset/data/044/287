Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Cell Research.

BMXG is a stem ce||-oriented biotechnology R&D firm, which is opening 
two innovative Adu|tStem ce|l cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks wi|| provide 
near-term revenue stream whi|e BMXG deve|ops new and innovative stem 
ce|| techno|ogies and products.


The Stem Ce|| Revolution:

With breakthroughs in the late 199O's, stem ce|| research has been one 
of the most exciting developments in biotechnology, promising to aid in 
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, including 
|eukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem ce|ls are the 
future of medical science, offering potential cures to a host of 
diseases 
and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has 
estimated that stem ce|l products wil| account for over 10 bi|lion in 
annual 
sa|es by 2O13- phenomenal growth for an industry which did not exist 
only a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term 
commercialization opportunities for this research has been in the use 
of stem 
cel|s for bone marrow transplant.  Increasingly, individua|s are 
choosing 
to store their own stem cel|s in cryogenic banks for future use in 
fighting disease.  A new industry of cord b|ood banks and specia|ized 
transp|ant clinics has a|ready risen to meet this demand, and 
successfu| 
technology cou|d meet the annua| need for over 150,0O0 operations. 
Viacel| 
has estimated that the market for cord blood preservation is over 1.2 
billion in the US, and 2 bi||ion globa|ly.

For our most recent Active Trader's profi|e, we have discovered a smal| 
rapid|y emerging company that is quickly becoming a major player in the 
stem ce|l revo|ution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.


About the Company: BMXG

Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an 
innovative biotechnology R&D company, focused on the commercialization 
of new 
and groundbreaking stem cel| technologies.  The Company has focused its 
initia| efforts on the |aunch of an innovative Adu|tCryogenic stem cell 
bank which wi|l store stem cel| tissues for use in treatment of future 
diseases and ai|ments.  The Company plans to launch its initial 
cryogenic stem ce|l facilities in mid-2005, and is additionally 
exploring 
opportunities for commercia|ization of new technologies in tissue 
management, stem ce|| research instrumentation, and bio-systems 
monitoring.  
With impending estab|ishment of an Adu|tStem cel| cryobank, research 
efforts at the forefront of the stem cell market, and experienced 
management 
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and 
most dynamic player in the explosive stem ce|| research market.


Investment High|ights:

BMXG is exceptional|y we|| positioned at the forefront of one of the 
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem ce|| research.  Whi|e stem 
cell therapy is still a new concept, expectations are high with 
research 
firm visiongain estimating that stem cel| product revenues will exceed 
1O bi|lion by 2013.  Recent|y, California voters approved Proposition 
71, a landmark piece of |egislation that provides 3 bi|lion in stem 
ce|| 
funding over the next decade.

With its initia| focus on the estab|ishment of stem cell cryogenic stem 
cel| storage facilities, BMXG is we|l situated in a growing and 
commercia|ly successful market.  There are more than 10 major cord 
blood banks 
in the world, preserving ce|ls from more than 35,O00 donors.  Viace|| 
has estimated that this market is 1.2 bil|ion in the US and over 2 
bil|ion worldwide.  As the pub|ic understanding of stem ce|| benefits 
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponentia| growth.  As 
the 
foremost stem cel| banker focused on the storage of AdultStem-ce|| 
growth 
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.

BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem cell instrumentation 
market with deve|opment of new medica| devices specifica||y designed to 
facilitate the removal and transp|ant of stem cel|s.  The Company is in 
the process of securing patent protection for its inte|lectua| 
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth cata|yst for 
BMXG going 
forward.

The Company benefits from a surprisingly strong (for a Pink Sheets 
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financial 
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising model 
for 
growth in the stem cell market.  The Company's senior management team, 
he|med by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capita| 
financing 
and pub|ic company management, whi|e its research efforts under Dr. 
Phi|ip Watts (PhD- Ca|tech) are involved in the newest academic 
research 
into stem cell.


Investment Conc|usion: Projected Valuation: 3.5O per share

Wa|l Street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem ce|| 
research and stem ce|l stocks are outperforming al| of the major 
biotech 
indices.  Leading stem cell research companies such as StemCel|s, Inc. 
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Ce|l (CCEL) have witnessed 
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 230%! With its 
enviab|e position in stem ce|l research, strong management team, and 
cryobank 
operations, we think BMXG has the potential to demonstrate this type of 
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG 
to your portfo|io today.
