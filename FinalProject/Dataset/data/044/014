The season will not start next week, since several teams have not sent in complete registration forms.
The earliest the season could begin is September 18th.

In the meantime, the Enron Blue team wants to scrimmage in preparation for the season.
They have 8 guys who have already committed to playing this Saturday.
Please let me know if you can play this Saturday (9-11 am).
I will try to reserve the field behind South Main Baptist Church (4100 Main, near Richmond).

For those of you who haven't paid yet, please do so ASAP.

Lastly, we currently have 16 guys registered, with 4 spaces left.
If you know of anyone who could play on a consistent basis, please let me know.
