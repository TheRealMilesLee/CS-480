Chad/Pig:
Good news. McComb checked the cart and it looked like we have at least one 
bad battery. I talked to Steve who sold it. He agreed to let me pick up 
another set of batteries on friday on the way out and drop off the old ones 
on the way back on monday. He'll check each of the ones he's giving us and 
make sure they are good.

Joe, this means you and I need to be on the road on friday early enough to 
get to SA by 5:30 on friday.
