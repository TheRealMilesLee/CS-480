I will be taking vacation next week (Jul 30-Aug 3).  I will be working on a volunteer project each morning from 8-12:30 -- so if you need me please call my cell at 713-857-2103.  I will be working from home in the afternoons each day and can be reached at home at 281-531-0385.    Brad Holmes will be attending Stan's staff meeting for me and will brief everyone at the usual 11 AM time period.  We will not have a staff meeting on Wednesday.

I will check my email around 6 AM each morning and then again throughout the afternoon.  I  will be in the office on Tuesday, Jul 31 starting at around 1:30 PM. 

Thanks and have a great weekend.
