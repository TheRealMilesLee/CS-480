The attached request was to run for 3 weeks.  It did not appear on this week's EIA message.  Pls add it and resend.  The sponsorships have been going very slow and we NEED the publicity.  If you cannot resend this, then please let us send a separate announcement on this program.  I will be glad to write one up and submit.  Please let me know.
Thanks, LV
