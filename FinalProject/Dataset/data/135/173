<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 5pt 0in; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Calvary greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I am Evangelist Rita Nura , a widow to Late Mike Nura. I am 72 years old; I am now a new Christian convert, suffering from long time cancer of the breast. From all indications, my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live more than six months, because the cancer stage has gotten to a very severe stage. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 5pt 0in; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">My late husband was killed during the Gulf war, and during the period of our marriage we had a son who was also killed in a cold blood during the Gulf war. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 5pt 0in; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">My late husband was very wealthy and after his death, I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for more than six months and I am so scared about this. So, I now decided to divide part of this wealth, by contributing to the development of evangelism in Africa, America, Europe and Asian Countries. I selected you after visiting the website for this purpose and prayed over it, <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 5pt 0in; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I am willing to donate the sum of $6.000,000.00 Million US Dollars to the motherless baby homes, needy, poor, charity homes and widows too. Please note that, this fund is lying in a Security company therefore my lawyer will file an immediate application for the transfer of the money in the name of your ministry. Please, do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use other than enhancement of evangelism.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 5pt 0in; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Lastly, I want you to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth acquisition without Jesus Christ in one's life is vanity upon vanity. If you have to die says the Lord, keep fit and I will give you the crown of life. May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the sweet fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
