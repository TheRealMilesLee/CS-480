Hi!

MR PETER ZAK
Spain.
PRIVATE AND URGENT
I am contacting you on business transfer of a hugh sum of money from a 
deceased account, Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will
make 
any one apprehensive and worried but I am assuring you that all will be
well at
the end of the day. We decided to contact you due to the urgency of 
this transaction.
PROPOSITION:
I am the account officer of a foreign customer. While he banked with 
us, I oversaw his accounts and other official/financial obligations as my
office demanded being his accounts officer.Unfortunately, he died in an
accident
He had a closing balance of US$18,500,000 Eighteen million five hundred
thousand
united states dollars in the account.While he was alive, none of his family

members was ever known to me other than his immediate nuclear family.
Since his death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward to
lay claims
to this money as the heir. I cannot release the fund from his account
unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as
indicated in 
our banking guidelines.
Having made a very frantic and exhaustive search for any family member that
would
lay claim to this fund, I decided to take my chance with you.I now seek
your permission
to have you stand as next of kin to the deceased as I have all
documentations including
his certified Death Certificate that will facilitate your stand as next of
kin.I also have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any
member of 
the deceased family to become beneficiary of this fund. 
 
Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual
business
endeavour by furnishing me with the following:
          Beneficiary name and address
          Direct Telephone and fax numbers
These requirements will enable me make some internal re-adjustments and
file your
name in all the forms and other vital documents as next of kin which before
now was
left blank by the deceased upon opening of the account ten years ago. Upon
your reply,
I will file for the release of the funds in your name.Be assured that if
you are serious
and follow my lead religiously, then this funds will be released to you
within a 
seven-working-day with all approvals given. We shall be compensating you
with a million
dollars on final conclusion of this transaction, while the rest shall be
for us. 
If this proposal is acceptable by you do not take undue advantage of the
trust we have
bestowed on you.
I await your urgent mail.
Regards.
Peter Zak.
