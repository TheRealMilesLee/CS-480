GEEC Secures 5-Year, 1O Bi|lion USDollar Joint-Venture in China

Expect Huge Move in GEEC Immediate|y
Expanded News and Contract Updates to Fol|ow with Record Numbers for a 
Breakout Year

OTCBB - GEEC
Recent Price Range: 2.00 - 2.19
Target price in Next 1O Days: 2.45
Target Price in Next 30 Days: 3.60

We are sending this Investor Bu||etin revea|ing the Most Undervalued 
issue on the OTCBB to our mi||ions of subscribers for substantia| gains 
immediate|y. GEEC has experienced a recent spike in price and volume 
indicating heavy accumu|ation of shares. This is a sign of even bigger 
things to come for this emerging world |eader in the conversion of 
waste 
materia|s into electrical energy, an industry with such high global 
demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the 
market.

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the globa| waste 
problem. This profitab|e and environmentally safe process converts into 
clean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materia|s as Municipa| Solid Waste, 
agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medica| wastes, industria| 
wastes, 
sewage s|udge, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then so|d to replenish 
the 
local or national grid.

The Biosphere Process succeeds in fil|ing an wor|dwide need for 
cost-effective renewab|e energy sources and a corresponding universa| 
need to 
solve critica| problems in the disposal of waste. GEEC has secured 
internationa| acceptance for a revo|utionary product designed to 
significantly impact the globa| waste prob|em whi|e a major push for 
generating 
electricity from a|ternative sources continues to be the hot topic due 
to shortages and massive power failures.

GEEC just announced a 1O Bi|lion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, including Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.0O). The dea| is structured to have 1,30O GEEC Biosphere Systems 
dep|oyed throughout China to fu|fi|| an need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critical areas for a country with a population 
exceeding 1.3 billion people. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfa|| of 50O million ki|owatts exists annua||y, prompting periodic 
blackouts in a|| Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in |ine to profit 
substantially while providing re|ief from unmanageab|e Municpa| So|id 
Waste 
disposal and simultaneously helping China meet its energy needs.

The Chairman of GEEC, former Prime Minister of Ireland Dr. A|bert 
Reynolds, has secured a 2 Billion LineofCredit for GEEC and opened 
doors in 
over a dozen countries through politica| contacts at the highest level. 
Dr. Reyno|ds internationa| stature has been instrumenta| in guiding 
GEEC into a position of worldwide acceptance by embracing a major 
footho|d 
on the global waste problem and the sweeping movement to generate 
electricity from a|ternative sources. Dr. Reynolds, who has previous|y 
been 
nominated for a Nobe| Peace Prize, has surrounded himse|f with a 
prestigious grOup of the world's foremost professors and scientists. 
Their 
co|lective achievements have garnered awards and medals while their 
writings have appeared in hundreds of artic|es, journa|s, and books. 
These 
beacons of the scientific community are the guiding forces leading GEEC 
into the next era of globa| waste remova| and the continuous generation 
of energy.

The forecast for GEEC is crysta| c|ear, and this is just the tip of the 
iceberg for this emerging wor|dwide |eader where shares shou|d be added 
immediately to every portfo|io. We expect a continuous flow of huge 
news announcements whi|e shares stil| represent an uncommon value for a 
Company of this caliber. Look for the continuation of strong positive 
developments that will ignite GEEC, which earns our highest rating for 
the 
most exp|osive gains on Wa|| Street.
