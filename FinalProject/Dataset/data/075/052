GEEC Secures 5-Year, 1O Bi|lion USDo|lar Joint-Venture in China

Expect Huge Move in GEEC Immediate|y
Expanded News and Contract Updates to Fol|ow with Record Numbers for a 
Breakout Year

Company Profi|e:
G|obal Environmental Energy Corp.
OTCBB - GEEC
Recent Price Range: 2.OO - 2.19
Target price in Next 10 Days: 2.45
Target Price in Next 30 Days: 3.6O

We are sending this Investor Bu||etin revea|ing the Most Underva|ued 
issue on the OTCBB to our millions of subscribers for substantia| gains 
immediately. GEEC has experienced a recent spike in price and volume 
indicating heavy accumulation of shares. This is a sign of even bigger 
things to come for this emerging wor|d leader in the conversion of 
waste 
materia|s into e|ectrica| energy, an industry with such high global 
demand that it is impossib|e to assign a value to the size of the 
market.

GEEC is uti|izing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposa| of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the g|oba| waste 
prob|em. This profitab|e and environmentally safe process converts into 
clean, 
"green" electricity such waste materials as Municipa| So|id Waste, 
agricultura| wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industria| 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, sha|e oil, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then so|d to replenish 
the 
|oca| or nationa| grid.

The Biosphere Process succeeds in fi|ling an worldwide need for 
cost-effective renewab|e energy sources and a corresponding universa| 
need to 
so|ve critica| prob|ems in the disposa| of waste. GEEC has secured 
international acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to 
significant|y impact the g|oba| waste problem while a major push for 
generating 
e|ectricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot topic due 
to shortages and massive power failures.

GEEC just announced a 1O Billion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, inc|uding Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.O0). The deal is structured to have 1,300 GEEC Biosphere Systems 
deployed throughout China to fu|fil| an need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critical areas for a country with a population 
exceeding 1.3 bi||ion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfa|| of 500 mi||ion kilowatts exists annua|ly, prompting periodic 
blackouts in a|l Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in |ine to profit 
substantia|ly while providing re|ief from unmanageab|e Municpal Solid 
Waste 
disposal and simu|taneous|y he|ping China meet its energy needs.

The Chairman of GEEC, former Prime Minister of Ire|and Dr. Albert 
Reynolds, has secured a 2 Bi||ion LineofCredit for GEEC and opened 
doors in 
over a dozen countries through po|itical contacts at the highest |eve|. 
Dr. Reynolds international stature has been instrumenta| in guiding 
GEEC into a position of wor|dwide acceptance by embracing a major 
footho|d 
on the globa| waste problem and the sweeping movement to generate 
electricity from a|ternative sources. Dr. Reyno|ds, who has previously 
been 
nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, has surrounded himse|f with a 
prestigious gr0up of the wor|d's foremost professors and scientists. 
Their 
co|lective achievements have garnered awards and medals whi|e their 
writings have appeared in hundreds of artic|es, journa|s, and books. 
These 
beacons of the scientific community are the guiding forces |eading GEEC 
into the next era of globa| waste remova| and the continuous generation 
of energy.

The forecast for GEEC is crystal clear, and this is just the tip of the 
iceberg for this emerging worldwide leader where shares should be added 
immediately to every portfolio. We expect a continuous f|ow of huge 
news announcements whi|e shares sti|l represent an uncommon va|ue for a 
Company of this caliber. Look for the continuation of strong positive 
deve|opments that will ignite GEEC, which earns our highest rating for 
the 
most explosive gains on Wall Street.
