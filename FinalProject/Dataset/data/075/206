Debra, 

My contact said on the first page of the contract he would like "cover" checked, not "spot" as it now appears.    

That is the last revision requested and if you agree, it should bring this deal to closure.

Tell them to submit language they would like to see and I will review it. Have them email you and cc me.

Debra,

My contact at LG&E has requested the default pricing in the contract be switched from "spot" to some type of "true-cost" verbiage.  His point was that if he is buying 10,000 on a given day from Enron and ENA only delivers 5,000 by the terms of the present contract Enron would be responsible for the "spot" cost of replacement gas or the gas daily average for that zone.  My contact points out that the market for gas when this purchase is to take place could be significantly higher (or lower) than gas daily and that is the cost they want to pay or receive.  

Is something like this request possible?

 FYI, I have started negotiations with LG&E, however they have not resolved the issue of party name(s) on their part.   I will keep you apprised of my progress.
