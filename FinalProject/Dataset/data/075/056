PDVSA have come in with the following FOB indication.  This does mean, however, that we must find our own vessel.  
I had a conversation with PDVSA regarding the FOB price which they are not inclined to lower at this moment.  The FOB price isn't that bad considering alternative sources.

There are not a lot of vessels out there at the moment.  Geogas' vessel cannot make it until November.  Maersk has a vessel and is willing to do the voyage on our dates for $.04 per gallon.  The laytime is the only problem as they will only give us 66 hours (they started at $26/mt and 60 hrs).  PDVSA should take no more than 24 hrs, which leaves 42 for discharge at ProCaribe.

We have the vessel on subs until 9:00 am Houston time tomorrow.  Please advise your comments.

Best regards,
Suzanne Clapp
