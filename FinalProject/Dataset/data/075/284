Steve:

Per your request, we've reset your password to "password".  Your user id to
Enron Forum remains your email address which we have as 'skean@enron.com'.
Anecdotes from participants and the evaluation forms we have received thus
far show that Enron's initiative in hosting 'US Energy Policy at a
Crossroad' was very well received.   Enjoyed working with you at the October
event and look forward to the next one.  Let me know if you need anything
further.

Kind regards,

Kelley R. Kenyan
