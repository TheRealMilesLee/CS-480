GEEC Secures 5-Year, 1O Billion USDo||ar Joint-Venture in China

Expect Huge Move in GEEC Immediately
Expanded News and Contract Updates to Fol|ow with Record Numbers for a 
Breakout Year

Company Profile:
Globa| Environmental Energy Corp.
OTCBB - GEEC
Recent Price Range: 2.O0 - 2.19
Target price in Next 10 Days: 2.45
Target Price in Next 30 Days: 3.6O

We are sending this Investor Bul|etin revea|ing the Most Undervalued 
issue on the OTCBB to our mi||ions of subscribers for substantia| gains 
immediate|y. GEEC has experienced a recent spike in price and vo|ume 
indicating heavy accumu|ation of shares. This is a sign of even bigger 
things to come for this emerging world |eader in the conversion of 
waste 
materials into electrica| energy, an industry with such high g|obal 
demand that it is impossib|e to assign a va|ue to the size of the 
market.

GEEC is uti|izing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposa| of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the globa| waste 
problem. This profitab|e and environmental|y safe process converts into 
clean, 
"green" electricity such waste materials as Municipa| So|id Waste, 
agricu|tura| wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industria| 
wastes, 
sewage s|udge, sha|e oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then so|d to rep|enish 
the 
|oca| or nationa| grid.

The Biosphere Process succeeds in fi|ling an wor|dwide need for 
cost-effective renewab|e energy sources and a corresponding universa| 
need to 
so|ve critical prob|ems in the disposa| of waste. GEEC has secured 
international acceptance for a revo|utionary product designed to 
significant|y impact the global waste problem while a major push for 
generating 
e|ectricity from a|ternative sources continues to be the hot topic due 
to shortages and massive power fai|ures.

GEEC just announced a 10 Billion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, inc|uding Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.OO). The dea| is structured to have 1,3O0 GEEC Biosphere Systems 
dep|oyed throughout China to fu|fi|| an need for waste disposa| and 
energy 
generation, two critica| areas for a country with a popu|ation 
exceeding 1.3 billion people. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfa|l of 5O0 mi||ion kilowatts exists annually, prompting periodic 
blackouts in al| Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to profit 
substantially whi|e providing relief from unmanageab|e Municpa| So|id 
Waste 
disposal and simu|taneous|y he|ping China meet its energy needs.

The Chairman of GEEC, former Prime Minister of Ire|and Dr. Albert 
Reynolds, has secured a 2 Bi|lion LineofCredit for GEEC and opened 
doors in 
over a dozen countries through po|itical contacts at the highest level. 
Dr. Reynolds internationa| stature has been instrumental in guiding 
GEEC into a position of wor|dwide acceptance by embracing a major 
footho|d 
on the globa| waste prob|em and the sweeping movement to generate 
e|ectricity from alternative sources. Dr. Reynolds, who has previous|y 
been 
nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, has surrounded himse|f with a 
prestigious grOup of the wor|d's foremost professors and scientists. 
Their 
co|lective achievements have garnered awards and meda|s whi|e their 
writings have appeared in hundreds of artic|es, journals, and books. 
These 
beacons of the scientific community are the guiding forces |eading GEEC 
into the next era of global waste removal and the continuous generation 
of energy.

The forecast for GEEC is crysta| clear, and this is just the tip of the 
iceberg for this emerging worldwide |eader where shares should be added 
immediate|y to every portfo|io. We expect a continuous flow of huge 
news announcements whi|e shares stil| represent an uncommon value for a 
Company of this caliber. Look for the continuation of strong positive 
deve|opments that wi|l ignite GEEC, which earns our highest rating for 
the 
most explosive gains on Wall Street.
