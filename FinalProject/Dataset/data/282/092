<DIV><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>recent price: $0.53</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>up 423% in just 2 weeks when we profiled it, and we believe it is 
headed even much higher after the acquisition of Wallstin Petroleum. We also 
believe, that with an impact growth that QOIL is experiencing and fundamentals 
are improving...We would not be surprised if they would make another acquisition 
or two in the near term. In fact it is OTC Live's opinion and belief that they 
would have to make another acquisition while the market is hot for the oil 
industry this week comming up. The crude has touched above $60 a barrel, which 
is a psychological point, which could now head to $70, as many believed that it 
would not touch $60 this year.</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>Oil prices are flirting with all time highs, and oil company 
stocks, which generally move with oil prices, have outperformed the market this 
year.&nbsp; Some analysts say if you don't make oil stocks part of your 
portfolio you have to be nuts.&nbsp; $50 a barrel, $60, $70, $80 to $100 a 
barrel have been predicted.&nbsp; NO one knows for sure how high it will 
go.&nbsp; Most agree it will head higher and it does every day, and so do the 
OIL stocks.</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>We believe and predict that QOIL will have some good news next 
week, as they would have to announce the drilling of their wells, plus an update 
on their recent acquisition. And we would not be surprised if they would make 
another acquisition next week as well. There will be a lot of good things 
happening next week, and we believe QOIL is headed much higher from these 
levels. </STRONG></DIV>
