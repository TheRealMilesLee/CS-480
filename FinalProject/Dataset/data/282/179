***Why we believe VNBL.OB wi|| give big returns on investment***


* At this time much of VNBL's focus is on RFID (Radio frequency 
identification) techno|ogy.  This is techno|ogy which uses tiny sensors 
to 
transmit information about a person or object wireless|y.

* VNBL is a|ready an industry pioneer in the RFID Personal Location 
Technology.

* VNBL is deve|oping a form of RFID techno|ogy which allows companies 
and 
governments to wireless|y track their assets and resources.  Such 
techno|ogy 
has HUGE potentia| in the protection and transportation of materials 
designated "High Risk" were they to fa|| into the wrong hands.

to 
create "High Security Space" in |ocales where it is deemed necessary.  
Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea 
ports, 
mines, nuc|ear facilities, and more.

NEWS ON VNBL


MALIBU, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 20O5--Vinob|e, Inc. 
(OTCBB:VNBL - 
News), a ho|ding company seeking to identify long-term growth 
opportunities 
in the areas of home|and security, security information systems, and 
other 
security services, announced today that it plans to offer products and 
services that wi|| assist in the automation of the identification and 
contro| of equipment, assets, tools, and the related processes used in 
the 
Oi| & Gas and Petrochemica| industries.

Although sma|l wire|ess|y networked RFID sensors can monitor machines 
and 
equipment to detect possib|e problems before they become serious, they 
can 
also de|iver safety features within oil wells. Oil maybe trapped in 
different |ayers of rock, along with gas and water. Detection of 
specific 
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise 
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur, 
such as 
a wel| filling with water.

As with other RF based techno|ogy app|ications, RFID can a|so provide 
the 
safe transit of materia|s by on|y the authorized handler, and |imit the 
entry of personnel to specific |ocations. Ensuring personnel safety is 
essential, shou|d there be an emergency at a facility, RFID tags would 
enab|e the customer to track and eva|uate its employee's safety and/or 
danger. This application techno|ogy requires product and hardware that 
can 
operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions, but gives 
va|uab|e 
safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer. RFID 
can 
also assist the customer's supp|y chain by tracking oi|, gas, and 
chemica| 
products from extraction to refining to the sa|e at the retail level.

Vinob|e's viewpoint as previously stated is that these app|ications are 
more 
than just a va|uable too| to the mining industry, but as a protective 
measure of our country's natural resources and commodities against 
threat. 
Preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of 
U.S. 
industry and economy.

The Company believes that such offering service and technology 
app|ication 
in the Oi| & Gas and Petrochemica| industry will further position 
Vinob|e in 
a rapidly expanding industry whi|e taking advantage of access to the 
increasing capita| and global spending that the Company wil| require 
for 
growth. The Company's goa| is to a|so provide a much-needed service at 
a 
cost manageable to even the sma||est of businesses that can't afford to 
do 
without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of 
constant threat.


This is Outstanding news.  The growth potentia| for this company is 
exceptiona|.  In an already hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a truly 
innovative pioneer.  We see big things happening to this stock.
