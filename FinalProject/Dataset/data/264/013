   Word of the Day for Tuesday April 9, 2002:

   quondam \KWAHN-duhm; KWAHN-dam\, adjective:
   Having been formerly; former; sometime.

     A  quondam flower child, she spent seven years at the Royal
     College  of  Art,  before  becoming a lecturer at Edinburgh
     School of Art.
     --"Interview:   Cool,   calm   collector,"  [1]Independent,
     December 13, 1997

     For  the  unregenerate  "peasant"... had gone there with
     the   successful   glass   distributor,   shrewd  investor,
     versatile talker, and quondam [2]bon vivant whose motto was
     "The best is good enough for me."
     --Ted Solotaroff, [3]Truth Comes in Blows: A Memoir

     There  was  an  exception  to  this in the form of Mrs Edna
     Parsons,  a  formidable  Englishwoman who had once been the
     Prince's  nanny  and now served as proctor, supervising his
     behaviour.  She  was  about  fifty  and true to her quondam
     profession, she could be quite strict.
     --David Freeman, [4]One of Us
     _________________________________________________________

   Quondam  comes  from the Latin quondam, "formerly," from quom,
   "when."
