As stated in my earlier email, the Company is under an obligation to retain, among other documents identified in the Bankruptcy Court's February 15, 2002 Order, a copy of which you all have received by email, all documents that relate to a pending or threatened investigation or lawsuit. As I am sure you are aware from reading the newspapers and watching television, because of the number of investigations and lawsuits the universe of relevant documents in just this one category covered by the Order is very large. You must retain all relevant company-related documents until these actual or threatened lawsuits and investigations are over. No one can then second-guess whether you destroyed a relevant document. However, many of you have requested guidance on what must be retained in this category of documents. To that end, attached are the various subject matters of subpoenas and document requests that we have received. While you should be sure to take the time to review the subpoenas and document requests themselves, some of the topics covered are the following:
1.  All special purpose entities (including, but not limited to, Whitewing, Marlin, Atlantic, Osprey, Braveheart, Yosemite, MEGS, Margaux, Backbone, Nahanni, Moose, Fishtail, and Blackhawk)
2. All LJM entities
3. Chewco
4. JEDI I and II
5. The Raptor structures
6. Related party transactions
7. Portland General acquisition
8. Elektro acquisition

10. Nowa Sarzyna project
