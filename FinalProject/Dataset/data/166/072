<P>Dear friend,</P>
<P>This is a proposal in context but actually an appeal soliciting for your
unreserved assistance in consummating an urgent transaction. <BR>By way of
summarized profile of myself, I am Senator Luisa Pimentel Estrada, a 74years
old lady and the first wife of Joseph Ejercito Estrada (former head of state
and President of Philippines) who is presently held in detention in a
hospital outside manilla,Philippines.<BR>However, the current administration
of Gloria Arroyo(The President of Philippines) the present Government have
resolved to freeze all known assets of Joseph Ejercito Estrada including
properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the
various bank accounts of my Husband in Switzerland,UK and Australia. We
cannot be held responsible for the sins of my Husband. In view of this
plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this
distressed call to save our family from a hopeless future. And if you agree
to help, we shall discuss the disbursement ratio in our next correspondence
after we have been acquainted. In fact, the attack on our family (The
Estrada's) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our traveling passport,
family accounts, trying some members of our family in court for offences
allegedly committed by my Husband and even restrict us from seeing my
husband.<BR>&nbsp;Ihave carefully moved out these funds (US$18 million),
before my husband was impeached to an offshore Deposit Company.From past
experiences, many people I had regarded as close friends has capitalize on
my family's travail to run away with my money. In order to avert this
negative development, I in conjunction with my son (DANIEL) now seek your
permission to allow my attorney do a CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP/REASSIGNMENT OF
CREDIT of stated funds from the deposit company to your name, so that the
funds (US$18million) would be released to you as the new owner (on behalf of
me and my family).In view of this grievous threat to our Economic and
personal survival, our family trustee have secretly protected the deposit,
you are to assist us to lay claims of the consignment with the aid of all
legal documents that will be forwarded to you as time goes on.<BR>I am
writing because when I deposited the money in the deposit company, I told
them that it belonged to a foreign business partner and my present position
will not allow me to claim the funds. Consequently, I will present you as
the owner of the funds in the Deposit Company so you can be able to claim
them. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately; </P>
<P>1. Full names<BR>2. Contact address<BR>3. Telephone and fax numbers</P>
<P>Once I receive this information, we will prepare the necessary documents
that will put you in place as the new owner of the funds. The money will
then be released to your custody by the Deposit Company, for us to share. No
doubt this proposal will make you apprehensive,please we employ you to
observe utmost confidentiality and rest assured that this transaction would
be most profitable for both of us because we shall require your assistance
to invest our share in your country (buying of properties like houses,
hotels etc). This is why your urgent action and response is of priority to
enable us concluding this transaction in a timely and professional
manner.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Awaiting your swift response via this email address: <A
href="mailto:mrslpestrada@yahoo.co.in">mrslpestrada@yahoo.co.in</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
indicating your interest pls.<BR>Thanks and regards,<BR>Luisa Pimentel
Estrada. </P><BR />
