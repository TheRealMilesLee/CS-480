All, see attached 2002 Blanco Hub O&M Budget with Overheads calculated to reflect Payroll Only.

Lindy/John/Darrell, I need to find out who to send this budget to for 2002 monthly billings (Billings should be 12 equal payments made on Budget Figures, not Actuals).  I know in the past Je Chang did these billings, but don't know who does them now.  If you could let me know I would appreciate it.		Thanks,  tj
