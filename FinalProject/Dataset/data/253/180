Hi, I'm Crystal ;)
Most of the time very tired and don't want to go out.. girlfriend toled me 
to have fun online, where I put all my pics and videos ;).  My girlfriends like the idea of the site and I will post their pictures too ;D You just need to verify your age at no charge and that's it, don't want to get kicked out of college if minors view it ;)
Come check my pics and videos in there..
