Lindy, 
Current situation:
we are planning on subscribing 70.8% of east leg capacity, with 5% currently under long term contracts (therefore, 65.8% will be resubscribed at the max rate).  This produces the current total revenue figure of $186.6mm.  that is $9.4mm less than '05's subscription revenue.
On the phone, you suggested increasing subscribed volumes in the East to produce an incremental $4.8mm in reservation revenue.  This takes the current subscription rate on the East from 70.8% to 87.8%.  
Question -
Would this increase apply to '06 only?  If so, East subscription rates are 71.2% in '04, 70.5% in '05, 87.8% in '06.  If we can subscribe more on the East in '06, why not do it in '05?  If we do it in '05, then we increase '05 reservation revenue by ~$4.8mm also - total reservation revenue in '05 would be $200.3mm, and in '06 it would be $190.9mm - still the $9.8mm hole.
We can discuss further at the meeting tomorrow a.m.

I see at the bottom of the Business Plan where Tracy has asked for written assumptions for the forecast from you.  Has this been completed?  Steve would like to see this by sometime tomorrow morning for his review before our 2:00 meeting.  When will we have this?
