Subject: Michael Jackson's defense rested Wednesday without the pop star giving evidence in his child molestation trial. The final witness, comedian Chris Tucker, said he warned the pop star to be careful of the teenage accuser and his family. Jackson denies charges that include molesting a child and conspiring to abduct a child.
