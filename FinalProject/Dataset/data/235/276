Lynn, I understand Ashley came home this afternoon and both grandchildren are staying with Joe & Ruby -- apparently their son and daughter-in-law are also staying there -- they have to keep the girls separated.  Ashley was the one who had more breathing difficulties when the twins were first born.  We have stressed to Joe who is scheduled to work Saturday that we can cover the hours if he's needed at home.  So far he feels certain there is no difficulty with his being here -- we are ready in any event.

Will keep you posted.

fyi:  One of Joe's twin grandchildren (I believe the twins were born around September or October) is currently in the hospital (about the 4th day).  Ashley is the baby who has had some breathing difficulty from time to time.  She has had a viral infection and due to the shallow breathing, the doctor is keeping her in the hospital.  The doctor had said that shallow breathing often progresses into SIDS.

Felt all of you would like to be aware -- presently Joe and Ruby have the other grandchild with them.  Will keep you informed but know Joe would appreciate your prayers.
