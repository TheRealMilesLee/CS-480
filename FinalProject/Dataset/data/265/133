Symbol: ORTE.PK

C O M P A N Y   O V E R V I E W
 
Oretech, Inc. (ORTE.PK) has developed a proof of concept model that 
represents a breakthrough in ore processing technology. The process 
utilizes a proprietary high temperature technique to extract various metals 
from ore bodies that are typically highly carbonaceous.

OreTech, Inc's business model is to become a major producer of gold and 
other precious metals through the use of its proprietary technology. 
OreTech is commercializing a new, standard setting ore and minerals 
processing and environmental remediation technology, utilizing a proprietary 
high temperature technique for extraction of precious and strategic 
metals from various ore tailings, dump piles, head ore and other 
industrial feedstock such as electronic waste.

 

HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:

COLUMBUS, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 3, 2OO5--Oretech, Inc. (Pink 
Sheets:ORTE - News) CEO, H. Stephen Shehane, announced today that the 
company has completed the move to its new facilities. The Lab is in full 
operation and producing better than anticipated results. Shehane stated 
that initial results indicate significantly improved performance in two 
specific areas: 

a. ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY: 

Toxic chemicals normally found in mine tailings are significantly 
eliminated during the Oretech's process of precious metals extraction 
(Gold/Silver/Titanium/Platinum).  The SPS (Shehane Proprietary System) 
technology can provide one of the most environmentally friendly mining 
solutions, while being extremely cost effective. 

b. REDUCED ENERGY COSTS: 

With energy costs ever increasing, the reduction in energy consumption 
utilizing SPS technology significantly lowers operating costs 
associated with precious metal extraction. 
Shehane announced that discussions are intensifying with mining 
companies with a view to licensing SPS technology particularly for mining 
operations in environmentally sensitive regions of North America.
