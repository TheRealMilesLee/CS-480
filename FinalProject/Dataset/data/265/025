Dear Partner,

 You may be suprised to received this letter from me since you do not know
me personally.

 I am Zokolu Zabuanga the first son of Kuanzo Zabuanga ,the most popular =
farmer in zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country.I got =
your contact through network online hence deceided to write you.Before the =
death of my father he had taken me to johannesburg to deposite the sum of =
12.000000.00 dollars (twelve million dollars)in one of the private security =
company in South Africa, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe this =
money was deposited in a box as gemstones to avoid much dumorrage from the =
security company,this amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and =
chemicals for farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland.

This land problem came when Zimbabwean president.Mr Robert Mugabe introduced =
a new land act reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some black =
farmers,and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabweean war =
veterans and some lunatics in the society.Infact a lot of people were killed =
because of this land reform act for which my father was one of the victims =
and may his soul rest in perfect peace.

It is against this background that i and my family fled Zimbabwe for fear of =
our lives and are currently staying in the Nederlands where i am seeking for =
asylum and moreso have deceided to trasfer my father's money to a more =
reliable foreign account since the law of the Nederlands prohibits a =
refugee(asylum seeker) to open a bank account or to involve in any financial
transaction throughout the territorial zone of the Nederlands,as the eldelst =
son of my father,I am saddled with the responsibilt of seeking a genuine =
foreign account where this money could be transferd without the knowledge of =
my goverment who are bent on taking everything we have got.

The south African government seems to be playing along with them,i am faced =
with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear =
of going through the same experience in future,both countries have similar =
political history and as a business man i am seeking for a partner who i have =
to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands,i must let you know =
that this transcation is risk free.

If you accept to assit me and my family,all i want you to do for me is to =
make arrangements with security company to clear the consignment (funds)from =
their afilate office here in the Nederlands as i have already giving =
dirctives for the consignments to be brought to the Nederlands from South =
Africa but before then all modalities will be put in place like the change
of ownership to the consignmen(funds)and more importantly this money i intend =
to use for investments.

I have two options for you,firstly you can choose to have certain percentage =
of the money for nominating your account for this transaction ,or you can go =
into partnership with me for a proper profitable investment of the money in =
your country,which ever the option you want please feel free to notify me,i =
have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kind of expences
incurred in this process of this transaction.

If you do not prefer a partnership i am willing to give you 15% of the total =
sum while the remaning 80% will be for me and my family also for the =
investment in your country.Contact me with the above email address while i =
implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction =
till we put claims to the consignment (funds).

NOTE:PLEASE REPLY TO MY PERSONAL EMAIL ADDRESS:zokolu1@netscape.net

Thanking you,and GOD bless you.
Your's Truely ,
Zokolu Zabuanga.
