From The Desk Of Dr. Mrs.  Sara Dike
MD/CEO  Financial Controller, 
Nigeria National Petroluem co-oporation.
(nnpc) Federal Republic Of Nigeria.

ATTN:

I have interest of investing in your country as such I
decided to establish contact with you for assistance
as soon as I am able to transfer my funds for this
investment, which is already with a security company in Europe.
There are two basic things i would want you to assist me in;

(1) Helping  by traveling to europe as a front collect these funds from
the security company in Europe.
This is because of my  inability to travel out of the country which i
am taking refuge at the moment with my wife and children
which i will explain better to you upon the receipt of your acceptance.

(2)Helping me to carry out feasibility study on
areas/choice of investment you deem best for me.I
retired as financial consultant and was the last
personal financial adviser to the ex- head of state
before his demise and have no intention of carrying
out any further investment programme in my country for
security reasons.
Enclosing your telephone and fax numbers.

Thanks,

Yours sincerely,
Dr. Mrs. Sara Dike
