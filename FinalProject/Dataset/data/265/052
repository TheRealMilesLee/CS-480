  Assalamu Alaikum,may Allah bless us in the name of Allah Almighty the =
merciful.My name is AZIM YASIR I am a crude oil marketer in Fallujah, Iraq. =
During the war led by the US and the coalition forces,my home, investment and =
properties were bombed down.I lost my wife in this process but my two =
children survived the bomb blast and I escaped death but sustained a very =
serious internal injury that leads me to have been diagnosed with esophageal =
cancer.It has defiled all forms of medical treatment and right now I have =
only about a few months to live,according to the medical experts.
   I have not particularly lived my life so well as I never really cared for =
my family (not even myself)but my business.Though I am very rich,I was never =
generous and I only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared =
for.But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than =
just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.Now that Allah has =
called me, I want Almighty Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul.I =
need help from a reliable and honest person I can trust in the name of Allah =
the merciful considering my present predicament and the political situation =
in Iraq, I now seek your assistance to help me clear TWENTY EIGHT MILLION US =
DOLLARS (US$28,000,000.00)that I have with a secured company in Europe and I =
will want you to help me collect this deposited fund and help to invest it in =
a profitable business for my two children because I don't want them to suffer =
or lack of anything after my departure.
  Please I don't need any telephone communication in this regards because of =
my health,the present situation in Iraq and some of my relatives arround me.I =
don't want them to know about this new development and with Allah the =
merciful,all things are possible.As soon as I receive your reply I shall give =
you the contact of my lawyer in Europe and I will also issue a letter =
authority through my lawyer that will prove you as the next of kin to this =
fund base on my instructions.I want you to always pray for me and I have set =
aside 15% for you for your time and patience. Please send a reply through my =
above email address with your full contact information for more private and =
confidential communication and note that any delay in your reply will give me =
room in searching for another person for this same purpose because you are =
the only person I have contacted for now.Please assure me that you will act =
accordingly as I will instruct you to do.
Kind Regards,
