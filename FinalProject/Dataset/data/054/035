- Just a Reminder - 


"Help restore a child's hope and imagination through reading. . . . Donate a book to a child affected by America's tragedy."

Yesterday morning, you were invited to a social gathering on Wednesday, September 19, at Bossa.  In light of this week's tragedy, we would like to use our time together to help support those individuals whose lives have been torn apart.  Most importantly, the children of families affected by this tragedy.  

First Lady Laura Bush stated in a letter written to the nation's schoolchildren on Thursday, "Our nation is strong, and our people resilient.  We have a well-earned reputation for pulling together in the worst of times to help each other."  

All of us gain comfort from different things.  Think about what gave you comfort as a child - a special toy, a teddy bear, a favorite book.  When you come to our Quarterly Event next week, we ask that you bring a children's book to donate to a child to help comfort him or her. Please take the time to inscribe a personal note inside of your book, showing a child that you care.  By doing so, each child will know that your thoughts and prayers are with him or her during this difficult time.  

We have changed the focus of our event to support those affected by this tragedy and will kick off a week long children's book drive.  Please join us at Bossa on Wednesday from 5:30 PM - 9:00 PM and take the opportunity to touch the life of someone directly affected by this tragedy.   

If you would like to make a cash donation to help with Enron's relief effort, matching gift forms will be available at the gathering , and Enron will match your contribution 2 to 1.

We look forward to seeing you.

Sincerely, 

Traci Warner
Director
