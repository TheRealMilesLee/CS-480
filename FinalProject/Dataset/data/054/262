Attached is a spreadsheet created by KPMG with some results from CSC data and RPS testing done on California.  This is just for your information.  Do you have any idea what percentage of contracts will have a band consumption.  I am trying to understand your personnel needs to accomplish your objectives.  You can give me a call to discuss or just respond via email.  Thanks.
