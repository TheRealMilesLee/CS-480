 How to have information about the new California Power Authority delivered directly to your e-mail address<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />

QUICKLY, CONVENIENTLY, AND ECONOMICALLY 


The California Power and Conservation Financing Authority (the "Power Authority") is an important new player in California's energy markets.  Created by the State Legislature with $5 billion in bonding authorization, the Power Authority has the ability to acquire generation, transmission, and demand-side resources to lower electricity prices to consumers.  

 The Authority plans to procure up to 3,000 MW of resources for operation next summer, with a longer-term target of close to 5,000 MW (greater than the peak demand of San Diego Gas and Electric).  Already, the Authority has received proposals for over 115 generation and conservation/load management projects, and competitive RFPs are planned in the near future for central-station and on-site photovoltaics, central-station solar thermal plants, fuel cells, and micro-turbine resources.  A proposed Bolivian LNG project could also make the Authority a major gas-market participant (up to 1.5 Bcf/d).

 Clearly, this new agency will have a significant impact on California's energy markets.  The pace of activities will be very fast, and staying informed will be critical for anyone in the energy industry.

Generally, that will require multiple trips to Sacramento, numerous hours attending Power Authority meetings, and downloading and wading through technical and other documents.  Phoenix Consulting is offering an economical and efficient alternative - a new service, California Power Authority Letter (CAL-PAL), that can save you that time and effort by sending timely, critical information directly to your e-mail address with no effort at all on your part.  

Modeled after our popular KNOW THE ISO reporting/analysis service, CAL-PAL service will include: 
 
   (1) Advance notice of important Power Authority decisions;  
   (2) Concise, accurate, plain-English reports about Power Authority meetings and documents (e.g., competitive RFPs), within 2 days; and
   (3) Free Phoenix Consulting services, such as information and advice about Power Authority issues or other aspects of California electricity and natural gas markets.  
 
ALL THIS IS INCLUDED IN THE CAL-PAL SERVICE PACKAGE FOR LESS EACH MONTH THAN THE COST OF A SINGLE HOUR OF CONSULTING SERVICES.  

Finding out more is quick and easy

To receive additional information about CAL-PAL service no cost or obligation to you, just click on the "Reply" and "Send" commands on your computer screen.  We'll send you promptly a full description of CAL-PAL features, along with cost and other subscription information. 

I look forward to hearing from you, and to being your "eyes and ears" at the Power Authority.
