Aha!  Sorry I didn't remember sooner that Taffy sent it to me electronically.  Anyway, this should make things much easier.  Please let me know if you need anything else, I'll keep you posted on the bids.  By the way, does Enron have a preferred form of payment?  Oxy wanted to know if we wanted cash or check (?!?).  Isn't a wire transfer what we usually do?
