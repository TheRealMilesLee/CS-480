  Unfortunately, I do not have the emissions fact sheet.  I just called Habiba.  She is making final edits, but is not in.  I requested the draft asap.  Sorry, I thought she had sent it to me.  Here's a draft for Coal so you can see the basic format.  Additionally, attached is the layout for the folder that PR is printing for multi-purpose use.  Hope to hear from her soon and will send you the fact sheet asap.  Look forward to meeting with you next week to get things rolling with website and insert or brochure.
