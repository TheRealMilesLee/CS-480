I don't mind paying for the case, seeing that it was sort of my fault that 
we got it (or REALLY good salesmanship on his part). So all it is is $65. 
I'll send out a query as to when we can play... Are you guys in town this 
weekend? Going to the Dome again? We don't have anything going on. Maybe 
even a little golf in Napa is in order...

Thanks,

Scott
