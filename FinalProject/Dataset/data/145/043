THOMAS SKIPS PRACTICE TO REST SORE HAMSTRING...
Posted Thursday November 22, 2001 @ 03:35 PT


According to chicagobears.com senior writer Larry Mayer, Anthony Thomas sat
out practice Wednesday with a strained right hamstring, but the Bears are
hopeful the rookie running back will start Sunday night's game against the
Minnesota Vikings at the Metrodome.

"We're concerned with him," head coach Dick Jauron admitted. "He said he
felt better today than he felt yesterday. We'll monitor him right through
the week, but I don't think we're going to know anything really until close
to the end of the week."

Jauron revealed that Thomas has been hampered by the nagging injury for a
few weeks. That would appear to explain the A-Train's recent decline in
production. The second-round pick rushed for 58 yards on 23 carries in last
Sunday's win at Tampa and 45 yards on 22 attempts a week earlier in a loss
to Green Bay.

In his three previous outings, Thomas averaged 137 yards on 27 carries
including a 188-yard performance in Cincinnati. That effort shattered a
67-year-old team rookie record held by Beattie Feathers, who rushed for 155
yards against Green Bay in 1934.

Thomas was named the NFL Rookie of the Month in October, but he hasn't
displayed the same explosive burst since. He had seven runs of at least 16
yards (46, 32, 23, 21, 19, 18, 16) in the first six games, but none longer
than 12 yards the last three weeks.

"He's not a guy who complains, but it's had to bother him and he's missed
practice time, which is not good either," Jauron said. "When you have a
hamstring problem, you're going to feel it any time you try to accelerate at
all.

"He felt OK today in terms of where he was a week ago, but not good enough
to practice. We'll just have to see where that one goes."

Thomas said Wednesday that he's confident he'll play against the Vikings and
felt the hamstring problem was related to a sore left big toe that's
bothered him most of the season. The toe is much improved, but he believes
it contributed to the hamstring injury.

"Once you favor one thing and compensate for something else, there's always
going to be something that's off-balance," Thomas said. "I guess that's
probably one of the things that did it.

"My toe is coming around a lot better now. It's probably the best it ever
felt. Just from compensating, my leg's a little sore on the other side. But
my foot's doing real well."

Thomas said he planned to test the hamstring Thursday in practice. If he
were unable to play Sunday, James Allen would replace him. Thomas supplanted
Allen as the starter after the rookie's 188-yard outburst Oct. 21 in
Cincinnati. The performance was the eighth best in team history and the most
prolific rushing day since the legendary Walter Payton had 192 yards on 28
carries on Nov. 3, 1985 at Green Bay.

Thomas ranks fifth in the NFC with 638 yards and 4 TDs on 150 carries (4.3
avg.), while Allen has rushed for 243 yards and 1 TD on 78 attempts (3.1).
Since losing the starting job, Allen has carried just five times in four
games for 36 yards.

Despite the limited action, the four-year veteran did contribute one of the
biggest plays of the season. He dove to catch a 34-yard Hail Mary TD pass
from Shane Matthews on the final play of regulation in an eventual overtime
win over Cleveland Nov. 4 at Soldier Field.

If Thomas is limited Sunday, Allen would relish the chance for more playing
time in what's the Bears' third of six straight divisional games. Last
season the Oklahoma product rushed for a career-high 1,120 yards and his 290
carries were the second most by a Bear since Payton retired.

"I'm ready," Allen said. "We have a lot riding on this game, just like we do
week-in and week-out. I just have to play my part, see how it goes, and stay
into it mentally.

"Just to help this team win, if it's 10 carries or 25 carries, I've got to
do my part."

Stay tuned. ... I'll have more on Thomas after today's practice.
