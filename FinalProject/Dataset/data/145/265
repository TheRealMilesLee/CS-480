Hi and happy turkey days to all my family!

I am emailing you some websites on MMD that those of you can find out more 
about this condition.  I did a research paper on this topic for my 
Pathophysiology class for my Paramedic Degree and every year it seems the 
information is changing.  I also suggest to those of you (especially the 
ones diagnosed ) register with the MDAUSA.ORG home page to receive quest 
magazine it keeps me up dated on treatments and dna discoveries.

1.  www.mda.org.au/specific/mdamyt.html
2.www.mdsusa.org/publications/fa-mmd-family.html
3.www.mdausa.org/publications/Quest/q84resup.cfm
4.www.mdausa.org/publications/fa-mmd-qa.html

This will hopefully help you all to understand and better plan your check 
ups with your primary care physcian. (If your like Andy and I you have at 
least three specialists you must see Yearly.)

Love and Kisses to everyone !  Tina and Family

P.S. I received a 90 on my paper lost 10 points for spelling and grammatical 
errors.  oops forgot to use spell check.
