- THIS JUST IN FROM ONE OUR 575,000 USERS!

I just want to take a minute and tell you what a terrific 
job you all are doing there at INO.com. 

A while back I asked my broker if there was some way to get 
current, Intraday price updates on their otherwise very 
good on-line system. He said ‘No’.  Then said, ‘Wait a 
minute- try INO.com, they can give you 10 and 30-minute 
updates at no charge.’ 

Well, it's been an enlightening experience every day since. 
While the Lee Gettess product didn't work out for me, the 
John Crane Reversal Day product is proving very insightful 
and was the catalyst for a few successful trades this week. 

I look forward to my morning, evening and weekly extreme 
market updates and I plan to shop at the INO store on many 
occasions in the future to take advantage of the many 
excellent educational opportunities there. 

My 'Portfolio' and 'Quote Board' window allow me to draw a 
much sharper bulls-eye and hit my upside targets with much 
greater accuracy than in the past. I've been trading for a 
few years now and have always enjoyed it, but you've injected 
a new vitality and brought a new life to the markets for me. 

Just yesterday, when exiting a long Bean position for a 
modest but appreciated profit I thanked my broker for 
turning me on to INO.com and I meant it. 

You all are doing a bang-up job and I personally think a 
lot of 'dotcom' start up outfits could do a lot worse than 
to take a look at your approach and the way you cater to 
your clientele. 

Keep up the good work, it's greatly appreciated.
