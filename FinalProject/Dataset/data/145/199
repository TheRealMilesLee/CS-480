Bill -- My understanding was that Enron had satisfied PJM's credit requirements last week; however, below is a notice that the bill has not been paid and Enron will not be able to participate in PJM markets if the bill is not paid by 11/27 COB.
 
Please let us know if Gov't Affairs needs to call PJM to try to discuss this.  Christi 37007.
