The MTD AVG for two reports in the East package are exhibiting errors.

I'm working on the problem, but haven't a solution yet.
I've contacted Yan, regarding it and hope to have a fix for it 
very soon.

Thanks,
Kim

Yan, 

Where can I find the link to the interactive CUBE.

The reason I ask is Adam has two reports (Southern Natural and Algonquin & Maritimes NE) 
where the MTD AVG for October is skewed upwards.  
Higher than it should be for the values reported for Oct 1, 2, 3...like it's including numbers not shown.
