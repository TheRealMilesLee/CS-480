Dear Sir,
 
I write to crave your indulgence over the transfer and management
of some funds deposited in a vault by my father Yasser Arafat,
the late palestinian president.
 
I am compelled by the event of my father's death to seek a foreign
contact as partner with me in repartriating this funds
for safe investment abroad. Could you in earliest possible confirm your
interest and  readiness in this venture.
 
Thanks in anticipation of your prompt and positive reply.
 
 
Faithfully
El-Abdull Arafat.
