Good day,


This mail will definitely be coming to you as a 
surprise, but i must crave your indulgence to 
introduce myself to you. I am Mr. Mohammed Hud 
Banguru , brother inlaw (Brother to one of his wives)
to late President Gnassingbe Eyadema of the Lome, 
Togo in West Africa.


I am a Sierra Leonian by birth and I am presently 
in Lome, Togo, where the living conditions are 
unbearable due to the present political situation 
of the country. I do not wish to take your time 
with a lenghty mail but I have to put this proposal
to you so that you can assist me. While I was still 
in contact with President Eyadema Gnassingbe ,he made
a deposit in my name to a security firm in Europe, 
which has an affiliate branch in London without no 
person awareness even Faure Gnassingbe his son 
who is now the present President.

You can visit the web pages for more info below:

http://abclocal.go.com/wtvd/news/020505_APworld_togo.html
http://www.tampatribune.com/News/MGBGE28OX4E.html
http://newsfromrussia.com/world/2005/02/09/58174.html



This deposit was made in my name and the secret 
code and necessary documents are presently in 
the possession of my cousin presently in London
refugee camp. This deposit was made in the form 
of a consigment and the content is a considerable 
huge amount of money in United state dollars which 
I cannot disclose to you for security purposes, 
until you have confirmed your willingness to 
assist me.


I would be pleased and grateful to you if you 
could assist me in collecting this consignment 
on my behalf from the security firm in Europe, 
upon which i will be offering you a percentage 
for your efforts.


My cousin, in London, will arrange an authority 
to release and in your name which you will tender
to the security firm coupled with all necessary 
documents that will back up your claims in 
collecting this consignment on my behalf.


I have to stop here now as your response will 
determine our subsequent corresspondence. Please 
feel free to dis-regard this proposal if it is 
not in line with your principles.


PLEASE RESPOND THIS MAIL FOR CONFIDENTIALITY  
BELOW:

        mohammedhudbanguru@web-mail.com.ar

            
You should be very confidential with this my proposal 
because if Mr. Faure Gnassingbe who is now the present 
President of Togo, Togo government agencies, or anybody
get to know of this venture, he will use all arsenal 
within his power to confisticate this fund to himself.


I await your positive response with your names, 
address, telephone numbes and confidential email address,
so that we can proceed at once.



Regards,

Mohammed Hud Banguru
