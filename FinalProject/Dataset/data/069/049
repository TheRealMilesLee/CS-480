David,
Here is Legal's spin on the amendment...can you guys work with this?  Do
you know the upstream contract number?  Thanks.

For the term of this Amendment, Transwestern agrees to provide a credit
to the Shipper for quantities that could not be scheduled hereunder due
to an event of Force Majeure, as reasonably determined by Transwestern,
on Contract No. ___ (upstream contract) rendering the supplies
unavailable.  The amount of the credit will be calculated by multiplying
the quantities made unavailable by the Discounted Rate.

Michelle,

Here is a quick paragraph that I think addresses the Force Majuere
issue.  Joe 
is out this afternoon and may inject his thoughts so let's touch base on

Monday.  Have a good weekend, I hope the dentist was kind!

Best Regards
David
