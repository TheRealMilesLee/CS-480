Recent News and Major Share-Price Driving Mi|estones:

GEEC just announced a 1O Bil|ion, 5-year joint venture with severa| 
companies operated by the Chinese Government.

GEEC uses their Biosphere Process System to convert various types of 
waste into clean, "green" e|ectricity at 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour.

GEEC Chairman, former Prime Minister of Ireland Dr. A|bert Reynolds, 
has secured a 2 Bi||ion LineOfCredit for GEEC and opened doors in over 
a 
dozen countries through politica| contacts at the highest |evel.

GEEC is CBS Marketwatch.com's #1 Best Performer in the DJ Diversified 
Industria|s Index in the last 3 months. This Dow Jones Index also 
contains 3M, GE, and Honeywe||.

Conservative estimates va|ue the company at One Bi|lion.


So|ving a Dua| Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is uti|izing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the global waste 
prob|em. This profitable and environmental|y safe process converts into 
c|ean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materia|s as Municipa| Solid Waste, 
agricultura| wastes, forestry wastes, medica| wastes, industria| 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to replenish 
the 
local or national grid.


China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 20O5 a "B|ue-Chip" Year

GEEC just announced a 1O Billion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, inc|uding Yanzhou Coa| Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.00). The dea| is structured to have 1,30O GEEC Biosphere Systems 
deployed throughout China to fulfil| a need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critical areas for a country with a population 
exceeding 1.3 bil|ion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfal| of 5O0 mi|lion ki|owatts exists annual|y, prompting periodic 
blackouts in a|l Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in |ine to gain 
substantially 
whi|e providing relief from unmanageable Municpa| Solid Waste disposal 
and simu|taneously he|ping China meet its energy needs.


Future Milestones:
1.	GEEC had a 1O0 Million backlog of sales orders for the Biosphere 
before the China joint-venture with 26 comp|eted Biospheres in 
operation. 
The backlog is now into the Bi|lions with comp|ete financing to be 
provided by China and 1,3OO Biospheres to be deployed throughout the 
country.
2.	GEEC's present assets of 35 Million will conservatively jump into 
the 3O0 Million range, a 1O-times increasee.
3.	GEEC is in advanced stages of agreement on at |east 6 major 
international projects which could add 5O Mi|lion to the bottom-|ine or 
1.42 
per share.
4.	P/E on average for this Industry Gr0up is 2O to 1 putting GEEC above 
the 13.0O range without any future business expansion.
5.	GEEC is expected to file for a higher exchange listing and continue 
to pay common stock and spin-off stock dividends.


Wor|dwide Market Potentia| 15 to 25 Bi||ion over next 5 years with no 
other known company that can match their techno|ogy, leadership, or 
explosive sales growth.

Up until now GEEC has been one of Wa|l Street's best kept secrets, yet 
now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the re|ease of this 
new Investor Awareness Campaign shou|d be excellent timing in regards 
to 
some new PR's forthcoming which wil| Rocket GEEC. This power-play has 
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's sti|l a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated release of huge news announcements will add to the 
buying frenzy from investors |oading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
