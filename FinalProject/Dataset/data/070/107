Do you know if this publication is being done with Enron's consent? Is Enron's consent necessary?

Apparently, Global Change Associates is the author.

One of our outside lawyers forwarded this to us yesterday.

How has Enron managed to achieve such success while other energy firms have struggled to deal with the changing market landscape?

Global Change Associates is pleased to announce the publication of a new corporate profile entitled, "Enron 2001: An Inside View". This objective study takes an insider¹s look at Enron, specifically, how the firm operates and the keys to its success. Much of the information provided comes from first hand accounts and covers areas such as:

… The firm¹s structure and operations
… The recruitment and training of new employees
… How Enron empowers and compensates its employees
… The keys to structuring Enron type "risk free" transactions
… How to negotiate with Enron
… Why Enron occasionally forgives counterparty obligations
… Is the Enron model right for your organization?

Enron 2001: An Inside View is a unique publication. It provides valuable insight into the firm¹s operations and analyzes its successes and failures. For those firms dealing directly with Enron, or thinking about adopting some of Enron¹s business practices, it is an invaluable, must have tool. 

This innovative study is available for purchase at $995.00.
