Energy Suppliers - CERA Decision Brief 



Title: The End of Retail Electric Competition in California

CALIFORNIA REGULATORS SUSPEND DIRECT ACCESS TO COMPETIIVE ENERGY SUPPLIERS

California, once considered a harbinger of retail electricity deregulation, is 
reversing its previous efforts to create a competitive market for electricity. 
Suspending direct access is the latest--though probably not the final--event in 
an ongoing series of developments and unique conditions that has made 
deregulation a rocky road for players in the California market. 

*  This decision should not be interpreted as a rejection of the merits of 
retail competition, but rather understood as a decision peculiar to the events 
in California that have unfolded over the past 18 months. 

*  The ruling was motivated by the state's need to provide a stable investment 
environment to support its impending $13.4 billion bond offering to cover 
energy related costs. 

*  The demise of retail competition in California may delay other states' 
efforts to open their markets. However, most states face a very different power 
generation situation, practically ensuring that events in California will not 
be repeated in their markets. 

*  From a market perspective this may actually be an ideal time to push forward 
with retail choice programs, as many markets move into surplus capacity 
situations.
