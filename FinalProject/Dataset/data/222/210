Hi Teb!

It's right around the corner, that special day in February. 
And it's a good time to think of your previous sweethearts.

Take a look now and see if you can find some of those special 
Valentines from your past!

Higher Learning
Go back to the simpler times of keggers, all-nighters and 
more with our new College directory. Add yourself to any of 
more than 30,000 colleges and universities. Who says you 
can't go back to college? Not us!
http://www.classmates.com/go/e/74243541/CC020402BC/CM175T

With our new College directory, finding those old friends 
(and those old more-than-just friends) has never been easier.

So if you haven't already, add yourself to our College 
directory. Once you do, you're just a few clicks away from 
finding even more old friends (and Valentines!)

Wendy Dickerman
