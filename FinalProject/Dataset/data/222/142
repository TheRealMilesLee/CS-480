Paul, 
	Thanks for forwarding my resume to Tom.  I met with him and
several other nice people over there this afternoon. They seem like a
great group to work with. The position sounds very interesting and like
it would be a good opportunity.  Hopefully, something will work out.
Again, I really appreciate your efforts.


Thanks,
Joe
