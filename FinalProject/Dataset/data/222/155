Ø	You will be asked to change your password, follow the standard Enron rules

Ø	Your desktop will look the same

Ø	Email will not be affected until Day 1, on which you will have your new UBSWE email address

Ø	All compliant data and email should be copied to the UBSWE environment no later than Midnight (CST), Thursday, February 7, 2002 (see Data Migration Protocol email for compliancy direction)

Ø	No data or emails are to be deleted from the system
