Letter from: Daniel Kabila

                       INVESTMENT OFFER.
Dear,
In appreciation of your esteemed contact received through a reliable source 
and the choice of your country I wish to introduce myself, I am Daniel Kabila 
the son of the late DRC President Laurent Desire Kabila of the blessed memory. 
I know this letter might come to you as a surprise but I honestly do not 
intend to surprise you. I write this letter in respect of my intention to 
invest the sum of US$12M(Twelve Million United State Dollars) with you. I 
inherited this money from my mother. This money was got through the smuggling 
and sales of Diamond and Timber when my father was the head of state. My 
mother though not her legal wife used her privilege position to engage in the 
business of Diamond and Timber since she knows that her survival will depend 
on how much she can get out of the privilege situation. 

When my father was assassinated on 16TH Jan. 01 by one of his bodyguards 
Lt.Rashidi Kasereke through the conspiracy of some top army officers that 
wanted to topple him I escaped to SA because of the fear that I might be 
arrested by my half brother Lt. General Joseph Kabila the present head of 
state. Actually his mother and my mother are not in the best of relationship 
because of who among them will be the first lady tussle and this ultimately 
affected us their children. Considering the relationship between SA and my 
country's new government, my mother advised me to leave For SA for security 
reason, while the funds were deposited with a security Company abroad. 

On getting to there where I have been living since then as a political refugee 
I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me in moving this money 
out for safe banking and profitable investment. Honestly I contacted you 
because I don't want to invest this money in here due to my status here as a 
political Refugee. And moreover I wouldn't want to take risk because this 
money is all that I and my Mother is depending on because My half brother has 
seized all my father's assets and money and left I and my mother empty handed 
without knowing about this funds deposited at the Security Company in abroad 
so that is why I decided that investing this money abroad should be the best 
investment for me. I will be honored if I can be given the privilege of 
investing this money with your help.

In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to 
respond to this distress call to save my mother and I from a hopeless future. 
And if you agree, I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort 
in this regard with 15% of the total money and annual 5% of the after 
tax returns on investment for the first three years. Thereafter, the term 
shall be varied. 5% for expenses, which may arise during the transaction( fax 
and phone bills inclusive). when the money is moved into your discrete 
account, you will be allowed to draw 15% in your favor, while the remaining 
80% will be invested meaningfully for our future if possible in your area of 
business and deterrents sectors of the Economy in your country which are 
dividends yielding.

Whatever your decision is please reach me immediately through my Email,and 
keep this letter tight secret for the interest of my family. 

Best Regards,

Daniel Kabila
