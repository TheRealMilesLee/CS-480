When my father was assassinated on 16TH Jan=2E 01 by one of his bodyguards Lt=2ERashidi Kasereke through the conspiracy of some top army officers that wanted to topple him I escaped to South Africa because of the fear that I might be arrested by my half brother Lt=2E General Joseph Kabila the present head of state=2E Actually his mother and my mother are not in the best of relationship because of who among them will be the first lady tussle and this ultimately affected us their children=2E Considering the relationship between South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo new government=2C my mother advised me to leave For South Africa for security reason=2C while the funds were deposited with a security Company in Europe=2E 
  
On getting to South Africa where I have been living since then as a political refugee I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me in moving this money out for safe banking and profitable investment=2E Honestly I contacted you because I don't want to invest this money in South Africa due to my status here as a political Refugee=2E And moreover I wouldn't want to take risk because this money is all that I and my Mother is depending on because My half brother has seized all my father's assets and money and left I and my mother empty handed without knowing about this funds deposited at the Security Company in Europe so that is why I decided that investing this money abroad should be the best investment for me=2E I will be honored if I can be given the privilege of investing this money with your help=2E
  
In view of this plight=2C I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distress call to save my mother and I from a hopeless future=2E And if you agree=2C I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort in this regard with 20% of the total money and annual 5% of the after tax returns on investment for the first three years=2E Thereafter=2C the term shall be varied 5% for expenses=2C which may arise during the transaction=2C fax and phone bills inclusive=2E When the money is moved into your discrete account=2C you will be allowed to draw 20% your favor=2C while the remaining 70% will be invested meaningfully for our future if possible in your area of business and deterrents sectors of the Economy in your country which are dividends yielding=2E
 
Whatever your decision is please reach me immediately and keep this letter tight secret for the interest of my family=2E 

Best Regards=2C
