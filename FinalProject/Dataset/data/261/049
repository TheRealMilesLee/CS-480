Hi Friend,
In recent times over the radio in AMERICA or even in ASIA you must have 
heard about my family regarding huge sums of money stacked in foreign 
banks in different names for business. I believe, is a legacy we came to 
meet, when my late Husband became the head of state. It does not matter 
whether you are small or big but your ability to help me sort out things is 
mostly needed now. I do not justify myself but it has happened, so i need you 
to help me and my family survive in life.Thus it is with hope that I write to  
seek your help in the context below.
I am Hajia Mariam Abacha, wife of Nigeria's former head of state; Late 
General Sani Abacha, whose sudden death occurred on the 8th of June 1998. 
Since my husband died, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, 
frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration.
The security agents in the country have subjected me to physical and 
psychological torture. My son (Mohammed Abacha) is still under detention 
arraigned before the federal high court of Nigeria for an offence he did not 
commit. As a widow that has been traumatized, I am hopeless with my 
present faith. You must have heard over the media reports on the recovery 
of various sums of money deposited by  my late husband with various 
security firms. Some companies willingly gave up their secret and disclosed 
our money confidently lodged there, or many, outright blackmail.
Infact the total sum discovered by the government so far is in the tune of 
$700 to $600 Million USD and they are not relenting to make me poor for life. 
I came in contact with your name and address through my personal research 
and would want to have faith and confidence in you as I view you to be of 
responsible personality. I have no doubt about your capacity and goodwill to 
assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of $70.3 Million 
USD willed and deposited safely in my favour by my late husband. This money 
is currently kept in Safe Deposit Box (SDB) at a security firm within Europe. 
As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband's property is 
under the authority of the family's Lawyer(Attorney).
The investigative teams set up by my government have submitted their report 
after freezing almost all our account.Fortunately, our family lawyer had 
secretly protected the personal will of my husband from the notice of the 
investigators and have strictly advised that the$70.3m USD be urgently moved 
to an overseas account of any trust worthy but ANNONYMOUS foreign family 
friend without delay, for security reasons.All our traveling papers have been 
seized by the government thereby preventing us from traveling and all the 
local and international outfit of our business empire seized.
This sum of money is our only hope to stay alive. I have therefore agreed to 
compensate your good self with 30% of the total deposit only when you 
recieve the deposit box from the security firm and its
contents safely lodged in your account. They have equally guaranteed 100% 
risk-free and smooth transfer. If you are interested in assisting me, please 
reach me immediately and send to me your confidential telephone and fax 
number(s) so that I or my son mustapha can reach you as soon as possible.
 For obvious security reasons, it is imperative that you  keep all our 
communication very secret. Do not mention my family`s name or disclose 
the transaction to anybody. If you are not interested in assisting me, please 
still get in touch so that I can make alternative arrangement as time is of the 
essence.Please do not expose me to my government.
 You can browse on the links below for more information concerning my 
family's predicament. Please reply to: m_abacha@computermail.net

Thank You
Hajia Mariam Abacha.
