<P>
<DIV class=ar>CULVER CITY, Calif., June 3 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Small World 
Kids, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: <A 
href="http://www.zinester.com/lr/182759/4952643">SWKD</A> - <A 
href="http://www.zinester.com/lr/182758/4952643">News</A>), parent company of the 
wholly owned subsidiary Small World Toys, a leading manufacturer, marketer and 
distributor of high-quality children's products, today announced it has begun 
shipping its Neurosmith product line to its international distributors in Spain, 
Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, Hong Kong and Singapore. 
<P>The Neurosmith line, one of the Company's recent product acquisitions, has 
been fully developed in multiple languages and has nearly $1 Million in initial 
orders for 2005. 
<P>Small World Toys launched the Neurosmith line with eleven new products in 
April, receiving over 1,000 domestic distribution orders in the first 30 days. 
The Company is on schedule to launch four new additions to the Neurosmith 
product line in June. 
<P>Neurosmith is an innovative, high-quality electronic learning line designed 
to engage and educate children. The collection has won numerous awards including 
the Toy of the Year from Family Fun Magazine and Best Toys from Parents, 
Parenting and Child Magazines. 
<P>Debra Fine, CEO of Small World Kids, Inc., commented, "These newly 
established distribution relationships are a significant start to our growth in 
these key international markets. We expect to double our sales from last year in 
these seven foreign markets. We believe that international expansion is a 
significant growth opportunity for Small World Kids. Early Learning Centre, or 
'ELC' in the U.K. and Toy Europe Group, or 'TEG' in Spain, will account for half 
of the international orders that we'll receive -- together totaling over half a 
million dollars." 
<P>"This international expansion allows us to target markets that the Company 
has not previously capitalized on. We are constantly exploring new global growth 
opportunities, as well as potential strategic acquisitions, and I believe that 
these new distribution relationships will contribute to our double digit revenue 
growth from 2004 and allow us to deliver on our revenue guidance of 15% for 
2005," Fine concluded.
