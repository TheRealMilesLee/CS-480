Dear Sir/Madam,

We happily announce to you the draw of the British American Lottery International programs held on the 20th of May, 2005. Your e-mail address attached to ticket number: 5647560054-5188 with Serial number 5388/02 drew the lucky numbers: 31-6-26-7-35-13, which subsequently won you the lottery in the 2nd category. You have therefore been approved to claim a total sum of US$2,500,000.00 (Two Million, Five Hundred Thousand, United States Dollars) in cash credited to file BALH/1330158308/05/EGB. 

This is from a total cash prize of  US$75,000,000:00 (Seventy Five Million United States Dollars) shared amongst the first fifty (50) lucky winners in this category "B". This year Lottery Program Jackpot is the largest ever for British Lottery. The estimated $75 Million jackpot would be the sixth-biggest in U.K. history.

Please note that your lucky winning number falls within our European booklet representative office in Europe as indicated in our play coupon. In view of this, your US$2,500,000.00 (Two Million, Five Hundred Thousand, United States Dollars) would be released to you physically by our affiliate Bank. Our agent will immediately commence the process to facilitate the release of your funds to you as soon as you make contact with them.
