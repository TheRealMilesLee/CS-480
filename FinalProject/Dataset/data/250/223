Re: Transfer of (US$25,500.000.00) Twenty Five Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars.

Dear Sir/Madam,

We want to transfer abroad the sum of  (US$25,500.000.00) Twenty Five 
Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars.  From a security 
company, Fortune Securities & Vault SA, Madrid, Spain. I want to ask you 
to quietly look for a reliable and honest   person who will be capable 
and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new 
bank account immediately to receive this money, even an unfunded [empty] 
account can serve the purpose of receiving this money, as long as you 
will remain honest to me till the end of this important business 
transaction. 

I want to believe that you will never let me down either now or in 
future. I am Mr. Victory Spence, consultant Auditor General, Fortune 
Securities & Vault Services, Madrid-Spain. During the course of our 
auditing, I discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the 
security company in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated this account 
again. After going through some old files in the records, I discovered 
that the owner of the account died without a  [heir], hence the money has 
been floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be 
forfeited to Fortune Securities & Vault Services, for nothing.

The owner of this account was Mr. Thompson Watson a foreigner, and an 
industrialist, he died since 1993 and no other person knows about this 
account or anything concerning it. The account has no beneficiary and my 
investigation proved to me as well that Mr.Thompson Watson until his 
death was the chief executive officer, Diamond Safari [Pty] SA.I am 
contacting you as a foreigner because this money can only be approved to 
a foreigner with a valid international passport, driver's license and 
foreign account because the money is in US dollars and the former owner 
of the account Mr. Thompson Watson was a foreigner.

I will like us to meet to sign a binding agreement that will bind us 
together in the business. I am revealing all these to you with the
belief that you will never let me down in this business. You are the 
first person I am contacting for the business so please reply urgently 
for me to tell you the next step to take.

I require you to please forward to me your telephone and fax numbers; 
contact address and your bank account details that will be used in 
transferring the money. You will have to give me the assurance when we 
meet thatthis money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your 
country for sharing and disbursement of the fund using the following 
sharing formula. 25% of total sum will be for your assistance, 70% will 
be for us while 5% will be set aside to refund or take care of all the 
expenses that will be incurred by both parties during the course of the 
transfer.

I look forward to your earliest response as soon as possible.
Yours Sincerely,
Victory Spence
