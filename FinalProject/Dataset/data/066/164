I just spoke to Stephanie Sever with the EOL team, and she said this counterparty has been approved and should migrate tonight and they will send them a password out tomorrow.

Do we have anything on this entity that is in the pipeline?  I do not have anything on this.  

If you do not, I wonder if it is another one that Dan Hyval was handling prior to his departure?

Douglas County has been trying to get signed up with EOL for over a month.  From what the Help Desk is telling me, they believe its sitting with legal at this point.  Can you please assist us in getting their paperwork finished?

Much appreciated!
