Gerald-
I had an error in the Adjusted Purchase price calc.  Instead of $4,000,705, it should be $4,705,000.  Thus, the adjusted purchase price should be $209,863,642.  The error correction is in ENA's favor.
With that change, NBP is good with the document.
Thanks

Attached is the revised statement.  Please review.  I will have ENA execute as soon as I hear from NBP.
