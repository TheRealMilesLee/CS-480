Steve,
Attached please find the model and other files. Put
Frontera.dll in C:\winnt directory. The rest of the files
can be put in one directory of your choice. PSIM.doc is
a word file contains background info. The same info is
contained in PSIM HELP.HLP, which you can access directly
from Frontera.xls. When you open up Frontera.xls, a tab called
"Power Simulator" will show up in the tool bar. Click on it
you can find PSIM Help which links to the help file. To run
the model, you click "Power Simulator" and select "Write Asset Files",
then you lick "Power Simulator" and "Simulate" to run. Afterward,
click "Power Simulator" and "Create Result Sheet" to create
an excel sheet for result.

Call me for any questions.

Best,
Alex
