Sam -- Here are some thoughts we had for the Motion (plan to file 9/4/01).

For those not committing to join a big RTO:

No market based rates
Lower rate of return
No further stranded cost recovery
FERC opines on allowing a "safe harbor" on tax issue for those divesting
No innovative rates (could be a carrot too for those that join)
For non-jurisdictionals -- loss of all reciprocity tariffs/ subject to pancaking
Loss of native load exception
May be some other items that Pat Wood used as incentives in Texas

I have to respond in the SE RTO at 3:30 Houston time today and have a brief 4:00 conf call, but Sarah and I could either chat after that or on Monday (my cell 713-301-3421).

Thanks and we are happy to have you helping us!  Christi
