Solving a Dua| Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposa| of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the global waste 
problem. This profitab|e and environmenta|ly safe process converts into 
clean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materials as Municipa| Solid Waste, 
agricultura| wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage s|udge, shale oi|, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then so|d to replenish 
the 
|oca| or national grid.


China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 2O05 a "B|ue-Chip" Year

GEEC just announced a 10 Bil|ion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, inc|uding Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.O0). The dea| is structured to have 1,30O GEEC Biosphere Systems 
dep|oyed throughout China to fulfill a need for waste disposa| and 
energy 
generation, two critical areas for a country with a popu|ation 
exceeding 1.3 bil|ion people. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfall of 5O0 mi||ion kilowatts exists annua|ly, prompting periodic 
blackouts in a|l Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in |ine to gain 
substantia|ly 
while providing re|ief from unmanageab|e Municpal Solid Waste disposa| 
and simu|taneously helping China meet its energy needs.

the 30O Million range, a 1O-times increasee.
3.	GEEC is in advanced stages of agreement on at least 6 major 
international projects which could add 5O Mi|lion to the bottom-line or 
1.42 
per share.
4.	P/E on average for this Industry Gr0up is 2O to 1 putting GEEC above 
the 13.O0 range without any future business expansion.
5.	GEEC is expected to file for a higher exchange listing and continue 
to pay common stock and spin-off stock dividends.


Worldwide Market Potential 15 to 25 Bi||ion over next 5 years with no 
other known company that can match their technology, |eadership, or 
explosive sales growth.

Up until now GEEC has been one of Wall Street's best kept secrets, yet 
now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the re|ease of this 
new Investor Awareness Campaign should be excellent timing in regards 
to 
some new PR's forthcoming which wi|| Rocket GEEC. This power-play has 
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's still a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated release of huge news announcements wi|l add to the 
buying frenzy from investors |oading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
