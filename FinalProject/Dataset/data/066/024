If you are planning on participating in the Alamo Challenge on October 13-14, please get your registration form and pledges to me TODAY.  You will need to go online at http://home.enron.com/cr and fill out a matching gift form.  Please make a copy of the matching gift form or specify on your registration form that a matching gift is involved.  Matching gift checks will not be cut until the end of December.  The American Lung Association is fine with that.

I WILL BE PICKING UP PACKETS THIS WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 3.  Let me know if you would like for me to get your packet.

If you prefer to register later this week or next week, you'll have to pay for the registration fee yourself and get reimbursed by the club.

For more info on the ride, go to www.alamochallenge.com.  Thanks!
