Dear Johnny Palmer, 

I heard about openings in the ENA power trading team, employing 12 hour shifts. If there are job opportunities for a person of my caliber, I hope we can meet.  After graduating from Rice University and finishing my graduate degree in University of Texas' business school, I worked for Enron for 2 years in EBS and Corporate.  For more background, please look at my resume and let me know if you are interested in having a brief interview with me.

 
Sincerely,

Hector M. Alviar
