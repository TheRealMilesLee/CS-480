John-
For the testing of these deals as part of the Doorstep review, we will need the following from Risk Mgmt:
Deal ticket (system generated is fine)
Curve that deal was marked against (we can validate curves on day deals were booked to appropriate pricing index)
For open deals, we would like to test the current MTM value:  We will want to trace position / value to DPR .

Once we review the deals (via deal tickets) we can then get the additional info from the varying groups: 
Credit watch list for the day deals were booked (to verify that CP's are not on list) - Tracy?
Confirmation / Signed contract (on originated deals) - Joe Hunter
For liquidated deals (physical) - we would need to get scheduling support (verify transportation rates, nominations confirmations, invoice support, etc) - Murray, Cara?
Settlement of deal - I can contact Leslie Reeves group for support on this to verify through to G/L and cash apps. - Kim

Thanks,
Michelle
