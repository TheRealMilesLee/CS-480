<br>
Global box office revenues are forecast to grow to $25.6 billion by 2010. &nbsp;However, this number reflects only those films and produced works that are brought to the mainstream. &nbsp;Millions of artists worldwide are producing movies, music, short videos and blogs that until now may have never been seen. &nbsp;Tens of thousands of models, actors and athletes go undiscovered every year because they do not have an outlet to present themselves. &nbsp;Agent155.com fills this void and offers talent the ability to reach out globally via the Internet. &nbsp;Like Yahoo!, eBay and Amazon.com, Agent155.com is inventing a totally new, untapped distribution medium that will revolutionize the way we discover, view and interact with talent worldwide!<br>
