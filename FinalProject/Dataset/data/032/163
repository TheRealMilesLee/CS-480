Hi.  I wanted to let you know I mailed my parking pass to you.  It's in 
todays mail.  I didn't know if someone would want to use it for the rest of 
August.  If not you can throw it away.  Also, I'm ordering that chocolate 
almond roca with chocolate ganache cake from Bvtn Bakery for Duane's BD and 
was wondering if there was a filling in the middle???  I couldn't remember.   
Talk to you soon.  Susie.
