Enron is pleased to announce our partnership with the PacWest Racing Team for the 2001 Texaco/Havoline Grand Prix.

As part of its sponsorship, Enron has secured discounted race tickets exclusively for Enron  employees and family members.  Discounted tickets for the Grand Prix will be available through http://www.enronsigshop.com beginning Monday, September 24 through Thursday, September 27 at 5 PM.  The race will be held in downtown Houston on October 5-7.

We also are holding a contest to give you a chance to win terrific Grand Prix prizes including a ride in the official pace car to start the Saturday qualifying race; the chance to serve as an honorary pit-crew member; a special autograph gift package; VIP hospitality packages and much more.

Simply drop your business card (one card per employee, please) in the box next to the Enron/PacWest Race Car located in the Enron Building lobby.  

The car will be displayed from September 24-28.  Winners will be notified on Monday, October 1.  

Good luck and we'll see you at the race.
