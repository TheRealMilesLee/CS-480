Lynn,

The PAA requests are being processed for Ava Garcia, Mary Draemer, and Jean McFarland.  The team may not be aware of this but PAA payments are reserved for employees so the request form for Glenn Stovall will not be valid since he is a contractor.  Please call us if you have any questions.

Thanks and have a great day,

Miranda

Miranda-

Can you please complete these forms with the info from SAP?  After complete, please printout; I'm waiting for Shelley's signature before submitting to Carolyn.

Thanks,
