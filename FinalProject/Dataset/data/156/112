FROM THE DESK OF MR.ABUBAKA SAUDU
BANK B.I.C.I.A.B

OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO.
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,

PRIVATE CONFIDENTIAL

COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON.

I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign
remittance department of bank lnternationale pour le Commerce et le 
lndustrie et de la Agriculture du Burkina-Faso  I am writing following the 
impressive information about you through one of my friends
who runs a consultancy firm in your country. He assured me of your 
capability and reliability to champion this business opportunity.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 20m US dollars ( Twenty 
million US dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign 
customer who died along with his entire family in november 16,1998 in a 
plane crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his 
supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash 
leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery 
that I now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the 
money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and 
subsequent
disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don´t want this money to go 
into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.
The Banking law and guideline here stipulatesthat if such money remained  
unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank  
treasury as unclaimed fund.
The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by 
thefact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as 
next of kin to a foreigner.

50 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the 
provision of a foreign account, 50 % would be for me .
There after I will visit your country for disbursement accoding to the 
percentages indicated.
Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as 
arranged,you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the 
deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private 
telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location 
where in the money will be remitted .
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of 
the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this 
transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear 
as all required  arrangements have been made for the transfer .

You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.
Trusting to hear from you immediately.

Your´s faithfully,
ABUBAKA SAUDU
Bill and exchange manager,
BANK BICIAB
