Group -
 
I received a call from Greg Carmean, MD PSC Exec.  Director, regarding review of Enron's credit status.  It is Greg's  understanding that the MD IOU's are planning to review Enron's creditworthiness  as an electricity and/or gas supplier.  In the event that the Commission  needs to take any expeditious action in this regard, we need to  know who to contact within your organization.  Please advise as soon  as possible how you would like us to handle this matter.
Thanks,
Chantel
