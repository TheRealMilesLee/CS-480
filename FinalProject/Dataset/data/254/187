   Word of the Day for Friday March 22, 2002:

   arrogate \AIR-uh-gayt\, transitive verb:
   1.  To  claim  or  seize  without  right  or justification; to
   appropriate.
   2. To claim on behalf of another; to ascribe.

     What's  certain  is  that  another  American  President has
     arrogated  to  himself  the prerogative of dispatching U.S.
     military   personnel   on   an   overseas  combat  mission,
     disregarding  the constitutional mandate that only Congress
     may declare war.
     --"Imposing  'democracy'  in  Haiti,"  [1]The  Progressive,
     November 1, 1994

     A  measure  to abolish or radically restrict the ability of
     ministers  to  arrogate  powers  to  themselves  would be a
     necessary  adjunct  to  the  list  of  proposals  on  "open
     government/parliament".
     --Mike  Marqusee,  "Stumped  for  success,  New Statesman &
     Society, January 19, 1996

     The  most  sinister  dimension of this form of 'terror' was
     that  it  became an intrinsic component of Fascist and Nazi
     governance,  executed  at  the  behest  of, and in complete
     subservience  to, the ruling political party of the land --
     which  had  arrogated  to itself complete, total control of
     the country and its people.
     --Bruce Hoffman, [2]Inside Terrorism
     _________________________________________________________

   Arrogate  comes  from  Latin adrogare, "to take to oneself, to
   claim," from ad-, "towards," + rogare, "to ask."
