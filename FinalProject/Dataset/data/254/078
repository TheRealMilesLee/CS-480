Dear  Sir,    

Before I start,I must first Apologise for this unsolicited mail to you.Iam aware that this is certainly an unconventional approach to starting a relationship but as time goes on you will realize the need for my action. My name is Barrister Eze Samuel,a Solicitor and the personal Attorney to an Engineer, a National of your country, who worked with an Oil company in Nigeria.Here in after referred to as my Client.    

On the 21st of April 2002,my client,his wife and their three children were involved in a local plane crash.My Client and his entire family unfortunatelylost their lives in the accident. Since then I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my Client's extended relatives which has proved abortive.After these several unsuccessful attempts,I decidedto use his last name through the Internet to Locate any member of his family hence the need to contact you.    

My main reason for contacting you is to assist me in repatriating the money and properties left behind by my Client before they are confiscated or declared unservicable by the bank where they are deposited and lodged.Particularlythe EcoBank Nigeria PLC where the deceased has a fixed sum of seventeen Million United States Dollars($17m).    

The said bank has issued me a final notice to provide the next of kin of my Client or they will be left with no other choice than to confiscate his funds.Since I have been unsuccessful in locating my clients relatives for the past two years I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of my client,going by the fact that both of you has the same last name so that the said fund as stated above i.e the sum of Seventeen million United States Dollars ($17m)can be paid to you instead of leaving it for EcoBankNigeria PLC,we can take part of it and leave the rest for Charity.    

I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make.All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this arrangement through.    

I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.    

Please reply by this email address Email: ezesamuelchamber@yahoo.fr   

   
Finally kindly give me your confidential Phone and fax numbers so that I can communicate with you easily.    

Regards,    

Barrister Eze Samuel
