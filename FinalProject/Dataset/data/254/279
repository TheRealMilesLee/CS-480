Had some problems getting this interconnect on rate today. Steve Richards went out and got the flow contol valves to where they will operate, however, we cannot change flow direction from Gas Control. If the direction needs to be changed, someone will have to go out and do the valve changing manually. 

Thanks,

Mike E.
