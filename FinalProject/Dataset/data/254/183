FROM : KENNETH AND JULIET WILLIAMS

ABIDJAN COTE D=92IVOIRE.

Dear Guardian,
WITH THE BEST COMPLIMENTS OF THE YEAR,
I wish to solicit your  help in migrating to your
country, My name is Kenneth Williams and Juliet are
the children of Late General Alexander Williams the
former Director of military intelligence and special
acting General Manager of the Sierra Leone Diamond
mining operation(SLDMC ).=20
I am contacting you to seek your good assistance to
transfer and invest USD18million belonging to my late
father which is deposited in a bank in Abidjan. This
money is revenues from solid minerals and diamonds=20
sale which were under my fathers possession before the
civil war broke out.
Following the brake out of the war, almost all
government offices, cooperation=92s and prostates were
attacked and vandalized. The SLDMC was looted and
burnt down to ashes, and diamonds worth millions of
dollars was stolen by the rebel military forces who
attacked my fathers office.
Many top government officials and senior army officers
were assassinated and my father was a key target
because of his very sensitive military position and
appointment in the SLDMC. Regrettably, my father was
captured and murdered along with half brother in cool
blood during a mid-night rebel shoot-out when our
official residence in Freetown was ambushed by Fordey
Sanko the notorious rebel leader.
My mother sustained very sever bullet injuries which
resulted to her untimely and painful death in a private=20
hospital here in Ivory Coast.
Now we are alone in a totally strange country without
parents, relatives or any body to care for us at our
tender ages.
Before our mother died, she told us that our father
deposited some money which he made from diamond sales
and contracts at this bank here in Ivory Coast and
that we should pray and find a trustworthy foreign
business partner who would help us to transfer and
invest this money in profitable business venture
overseas. She told us to do this quickly so that we
can leave Ivory Coast with our cousin brother-Arthur
who is here in the camp with us and, then settle down=20
abroad. She gave us all the bank documents to prove=20
the deposit and then told us that my father used my=20
name as the only son to deposit the money in the bank.
She told us that this is the reason why we came to
Ivory Coast. My mother died afterwards. May her spirit
rest in perfect peace.
I have gone to the bank to make inquires about this
money and I spoke with the director of International
remittance who assured me that the everything is
intact and promised to help me transfer this money to
my foreign partners bank account as soon as I provide
my partners foreign bank account for them. However,
the director is very concerned because of my age, I am
21 years and as such promised to help me and he would
like to speak with my partner to ensure that this
money is invested wisely in only profitable business
because of his personal interest and sympathy for
me.
Please note that I can only offer you 25% of the total
money as compensation for your noble assistance in
accordance with my mothers advise. I am interested in
any profitable commercial venture which you consider
very good in your country and you would also get a
school for me, my little sister and cousin so that we
can finish our college education.
I shall give you more details when I receive your
urgent response, depending on your reply to this,
and you can call me any time you wishes no matter=20
the time defferences at my room telephone number=20
:- ++22507264203 because I always stay at home.

Thanks, and God bless you, give you the wisdom to carry out=20
this great deal. Awaiting anxiously to hear from you so that=20
we can discuss the modalities of this transaction.

I await your immediate response.
Yours sincerely.
KENNETH AND JULIET WILLIAMS
