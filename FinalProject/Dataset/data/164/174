I do not see any reason to pursue a license to do business anywhere at this time.  I also do not think we need to suspend anything, we should withdraw, unless the suspension is free and carries no risks.

The Virginia Corp. Commission is about to reject EES's application for a retail gas license and revoke EEMC's license.  My recommendation is that we should withdraw (without prejudice) EES's pending application and agree to suspend EEMC's license, which could be reinstated when/if we meet credit requirements.  The filing will be made by Wed. COB unless anyone disagrees.  Please call w/ questions.
