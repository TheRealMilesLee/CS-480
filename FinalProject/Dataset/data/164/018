WEST AFRICA.

MY DEAR,

I am Dr. TAFIK DADA, the director in charge of
auditing and accounting section of Credit Bank Benin
republic in West Africa with due respect and regard. I
have decided to contact you on a business transaction
that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end
of the transaction.

During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my
department came across a very huge sum of money
belonging to a deceased person who died on 30th
january 2000 on Kenya Airways with aircraft Airbus
310-304 at location Abidjan, Ivory Coast,  with
registration number 5Y-BEN while travelling with his
entire family, his wife, two children and a maid on a
festive visit to Abidjan and since his untimely death
the funds has been dormant in his account with this
Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody
either from his family or relation before our
discovery to this development.

Although personally, I kept this information secret
within myself and partners to enable the whole plans
and idea be Profitable and successful during the time
of execution. The said amount was USD$16.4M
(16.4)Sixteen Million FOur Hundred Thousand united
states dollars).

As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive
information through my good friend who works with
chamber of commerce on foreign business relations here
in Cotonou-Benin, it is him who recommended your
person to me to be viable and capable to champion a
business of such magnitude without any problem.

Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over
this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased
and get the required approval and transfer this money
to a foreign account has been put in place, all
directives and needed information will be relayed to=20
you as soon as you indicate your interest and
willingness to assist us and also benefit yourself to
this great business opportunity.

In fact i could have done this deal alone but because
of my position in this country as a civil servant, we
are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would
eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the
time of transfer because i work in this bank.=20

This is the actual reason why it will require a second
party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of
kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account=20
where he will need the money to be re-transferred into
on his request as it may be after due verification and
clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank
where the whole money will be remitted from to your
own designated bank account.

May i at this point emphasize that this transaction is
100% risk free as i have made all arrangements for a
successful transaction as an insider of the bank
before contacting you.

On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be
entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification,
while 10% will be set aside to take care of any
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer
like telephone bills, fax and our travel tickets to
come over to your country for the sharing of the fund=20
while 60% will be for me and my partners.

Please you have been advised to keep this a top secret
as we are still in service and intend to retire from
service after we conclude this deal with you.

I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this
bank until you confirm the money in your account and
ask us to come down to your country for subsequent
sharing of the fund according to percentages
previously indicated and further investment either in
your country or any country you will advice us to
invest in.

All other necessary information will be sent to you on
your acceptance to champion this transaction with me.=20
I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating=20
your wish in this deal.

For confidentiality reasons,kindly call me on my
direct line and also reply to my private Email :
hometafikdada@zwallet.com

Yours Faithfully,
DR.TAFIK DADA.
