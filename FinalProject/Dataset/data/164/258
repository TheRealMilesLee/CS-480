This aggregate information will be very valuable as you go forward in your 
career.  You can access this information any time off of the Haas career 
site to see how you are fairing relative to recent E/WMBA graduates.  For 
this to work those of you in the program need to take two minutes to go 
into BearTracks and complete the short Evening MBA Placement Report.

How do I report my salary information?

1) Go to the Career Services link below.

2)  http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/careercenter/

3)  Click on BearTracks enter your student ID #, the password is the word 
"password".

4)  Go to Placement & Salary Info.,  Click on EveMBA Placement Form, Click 
on Go To Evening Placement Form.

5)  Complete the boxes and pull down menus.  You are done

This is confidential information, once we have enough entries we will 
produce a placement report that will reflect aggregate salary information 
for current students and graduates of the evening program.  The reason we 
have not been able to release an Evening MBA placement report is due to the 
low number of students that have entered their data.  We need enough 
reports in order to protect confidentiality.

Please take a minute and do your part.  Thanks--John
