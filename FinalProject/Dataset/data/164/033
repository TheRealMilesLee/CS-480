I'll come by Tues.  Suzanne Calcagno told me that she is going to be doing gas regulatory (and I saw her on a list).  She said she is going to call you because she may be reporting to you now.

Christi -- 

Who in ENA leadership could we talk with about finding a "champion" for Gus Engheim (environmental permitting), Bob Frank and Harry Kingerski?  Steve Kean is talking to Ben Jacoby about Gus.  Who else - maybe Scott Neal on gas for Harry Kingerski and Bob Frank?


Let me know.
