Bill,

Here are the changes to the OBA.  Please review.  Also, please look at para 5(c).  Since this gas will only be a San Juan supply, we deleted the Permian and Anadarko price basins.  So, if the TW San Juan pricing information goes away, I would like to use El Paso San Juan Pricing instead of averaging the other two basins.  


Questar is coming in for a late lunch, do you think we can have this ready by then?


Thanks,  Kim.
