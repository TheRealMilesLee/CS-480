<BR>  <BR>>>>>>>>> <BR>Overview 
<BR>>>>>>>>> </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><BR>Global Diversified Industries operates in the modular building 
construction industry, and strategically targets the California Education 
Sector. GDVI is strategically located in Central California on 16 acres with a 
100,000 square foot state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Throughout 2003 the company focused on building it’s infrastructure through 
acquisitions, development of a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, and by 
securing the requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Through the combination of its new facility, the increased demand for 
portable buildings and the State Of California's bond approvals, GDVI has become 
well positioned to become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing 
on the west coast. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>GDVI should benefit greatly from the $12.1 Billion school improvement bond 
that is expected to be passed by California voters next month (March). This 
presents, in our opinion an opportunity for early investors of GDVI to also 
benefit before the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and 
subsequently invests in those companies. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Global Diversified has taken numerous strategic development steps 
throughout 2003, including generating strong revenues as well as profits and is 
now poised for explosive growth in 2004. The company is led by a strong 
management team with previous success in building companies into $50 million per 
annum businesses. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>In the past year GDVI has exceeded its own sales revenue projections, 
renewed its piggyback contract, received state approvals on engineered product 
designs, started a new credit facility and opened its new 100,000 square foot 
manufacturing facility. The company will continue to seek new acquisition 
candidates through its aggressive growth plan. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><BR>>>>>>>> <BR>Profile 
<BR>>>>>>>> </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><BR>GDVI is a holding company that currently operates three wholly owned 
subsidiaries, Lutrex Enterprises, Inc., an entity which holds equipment and 
inventory for the registrant, MBS Construction Inc., a modular contractor 
specializing in modular construction site work and renovation and Global 
Modular, Inc., a sales, marketing and manufacturing of modular type structures. 
</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Its principal customer base is currently educational (public and private 
schools, universities, etc.), child-care and municipality sectors. Its product 
lines consist of a variety of portable classroom designs, including both 
single-story and two- story floor plans. Global Modular's portable classroom 
structures are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre-approved 
building plans, commonly referred to as "P.C.'s" or "pre-checked" plans, that 
conform to structural and seismic safety specifications administered by the 
California Department of State Architects (DSA). </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Global Modular also enjoys the benefit of providing educational customers 
with products contracted under a "piggyback clause". The State of California 
allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular classroom vendors 
under a bidding process where the successful bidder can provide other public 
school districts and municipalities portable classrooms under a "piggyback 
contract" issued by the originating school district. This process saves school 
districts valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids. 
</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>A modular vendor who possesses a "piggyback contract" containing 
competitive pricing and a variety of design options may have access to future 
business for up to five years, depending on the term of the piggyback contract. 
</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><BR>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
<BR>The Strategic Focus on California Schools 
<BR>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><BR>Since 1998, California legislation has required that at least 20% of 
all new classrooms constructed with State funds be portable structures. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>There are five compelling reasons for this trend: </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Modular classrooms are FASTER to construct (as quickly as 2 weeks) <BR>They 
cost significantly less (as low as $30,000 vs. $100,000) <BR>They offer greater 
flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>They are easier to finance <BR>They provide financing incentives 
<BR>    </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>To cope with population growth, the State Department of Education estimates 
that California will need more than 2,500 classrooms each year for the next four 
years, which equates to more than 10,000 classrooms. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout the California 
Education Sector, public and private schools are expected to turn to 
portable/modular construction to fulfill their additional classroom requirements 
over the next four years. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><BR>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
<BR>The California Schools Budget Crisis 
<BR>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><BR>On November 5, 2002 a $13.2 billion School Facilities Improvements bond 
proposal (Proposition 47) was passed by California voters. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>This bond measure passage does not include an approximate $9.4 billion 
worth of local bond measures passed by various school districts throughout the 
state. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>A second bond measure worth $12.1 billion will go before the voters on the 
March 2004 ballot, which is expected to pass. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>These bond measures are about three times higher than the record $9.2 
billion bond California voters approved in 1998. The revenue generated from 
these bond measures will be used for school modernization programs, which 
include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular classroom 
construction and renovations. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and private schools; 
design upgrades and expand building space at community colleges and other 
institutions of higher learning throughout California. </DIV>
