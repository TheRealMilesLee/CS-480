> 
> Dear Third Friday Participant,
> 
> As you know, our usual Third Friday Luncheons were derailed by
> California's energy crisis.  PacBell hosted the last luncheon last
> November, and in December, the attorneys hosted the holiday luncheon.
> PG&E believes that these luncheons offer the regulatory community a
> wonderful opportunity to come together and discuss important issues that
> affect us all.  PG&E would like to reinstate these luncheons.  
> 
> PG&E is pleased to kick-off a new round of  Third Friday luncheons.
> Please join us on Wednesday, October 31, 2001, at Boulevard, located at
> One Mission Street at Steuart Street.  Hors D'oeuvres will be served at
> 11:30 a.m., followed by lunch at noon.
> 
> We have invited PG&E's, Senior Vice President of Public Affairs, Dan
> Richard, to speak about PG&E's recent Plan of Reorganization.
> 
> We hope that you can join us for this event.  Please RSVP to Rose de la
> Torre at 
> (415) 973-4716, no later than October 25, 2001.  Space is limited to 40
> individuals, so please regulate your company's attendance.
