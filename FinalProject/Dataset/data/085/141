Elliot and I just discussed trying to pull together a dinner in Portland on Wednesday, Nov. 7 (the night before our retreat starts) for our group and some individuals in the mid-market and services groups.  He is going to contact these individuals on Monday.
 
If possible, please try to arrive in Portland before dinner time that evening.  There is a Continental flight that leaves around 11:45 and arrives in Portland around 2:15.
 
Thanks!
