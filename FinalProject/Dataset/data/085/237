Qualified Orders Filled in 10-Seconds or Less - or They're Free!

Time is money. Nowhere is that more true than in executing your stock trades. Because in just a second, the price you thought you had can change. And that can cost you money. That's why we're introducing the Ameritrade 10-Second Guarantee. 

That's right! With the Ameritrade 10-Second Guarantee, qualifying S&P 100® Internet equity market trades that take longer than 10 seconds to execute are commission-free! (some limitations apply)*

How can we guarantee such speed? Our proprietary order routing system lets us dynamically distribute orders to multiple market centers to seek best execution. This routing system gives you a premium combination of speed, price and liquidity that has enabled us to receive execution on 99.5% of our trades at or within the National Best Bid and Offer.**

You deserve the best combination of speed, price, and access to liquidity from your broker. With Ameritrade you can rest assured that's what you get!
