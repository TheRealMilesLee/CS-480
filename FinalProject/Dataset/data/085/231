Subject: WHAT TO DO IF YOU LOSE YOUR PURSE OR WALLET


Good info sent by a friend:

A corporate attorney sent this out to the employees in his company.
 I pass   it along, for your information.

  WHAT TO DO IF YOU LOSE YOUR PURSE OR WALLET

  We've all heard horror stories about fraud that's committed using your
 name,   address, SS#, credit, etc. Unfortunately I (the author of this
piece
 who   happens to be an attorney) have firsthand knowledge, because my
wallet
 was   stolen last month and within a week the thieve(s) ordered an
expensive
  monthly cell phone package, applied for a VISA credit card,
  had a credit line approved to buy a Gateway computer, received a PIN
 number   from DMV to change my driving record information online, and more.

  But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case this
  happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel
 your   credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free
numbers
 and   your card numbers handy so you know whom to call.
  Keep those where you can find them easily. File a police report
 immediately   in the jurisdiction where it was stolen, this proves to
credit
 providers you   were diligent, and is a first step toward an investigation
(if there
 ever is   one).

  But here's what is perhaps most important: (I never ever thought to do
  this). Call the three national credit reporting organizations
 immediately   to place a fraud alert on your name and SS#. I had never
heard of
 doing   that until advised by a bank that called to tell me an application
for
  credit was made over the Internet in my name. The alert means any
 company   that checks your credit knows your information was stolen and
they have
 to   contact you by phone to authorize new credit. By the time I was
 advised to   do this, almost 2 weeks after the theft, all the damage had
been done.

  There are records of all the credit checks initiated by the thieves'
  purchases, none of which I knew about before placing the alert. Since
 then,   no additional damage has been done, and the thieves threw my wallet
 away   this weekend (someone turned it in). It seems to have stopped them
in
 their  tracks.

  The numbers are:
  Equifax: 1-800-525-6285
  Experian (formerly TRW): 1-888-397-3742
  Trans Union: 1-800-680-7289
  Social Security Administration (fraud line): 1-800-269-0271

  We pass along jokes; we pass along just about everything. Do think
  about passing this information along. It could really help someone.
