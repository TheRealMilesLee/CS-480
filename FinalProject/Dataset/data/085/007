John Brindle has arranged for our office to go to GW hospital now for testing.  We will be out of the office, but reachable by cell and blackberry for the next couple of hours.  Although we are all going to GW per Brindle's instruction, I would guess that only those who have been in Hart since Monday will be given treatment.  Larry Decker is the only person in Hart yesterday and today.  Most Leg staff have been in there since last Thursday.
