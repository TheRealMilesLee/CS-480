<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Natural 
Harmony Foods, Inc. is an innovative new company that has developed and marketed 
unique, healthy natural protein foods, addressing a growing market need.  
The first products developed by the Company address the ground meat consumption 
habits of millions of consumers who have some level of concern about the 
possible negative health consequences of meat consumption.  Under the 
SoyLean</SPAN><SUP><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">®</SPAN></SUP><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> brand, the Company combines lean 
natural meat with fat-free and heart healthy soy protein.  The resulting 
products offer the nutritional benefits of “veggie burgers” but with the taste 
and texture of real meat.  These are the first meat products to carry the 
soy cardiovascular claim:  “25 grams of soy protein a day as part of a diet 
low in fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease.”</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The 
Company’s initial products, SoyLean</SPAN><SUP><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">®</SPAN></SUP><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> Flame Broiled Patties and 
SoyLean</SPAN><SUP><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">®</SPAN></SUP><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> Fully Cooked Crumbles, offered the 
great taste of lean ground meat blended with "Heart-Healthy" soy protein.  
The Company’s trial products were sold during 2002 and 2003 in the fresh meat 
case of Southern Florida Publix Markets.  After successfully marketing the 
products for over 10 months, the Company made a strategic decision to withdraw 
from the market, and to reenter later as a broader line of frozen products with 
the same great recipe and unique consumer benefits.</SPAN></P>

style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> Fully Cooked Crumbles, Natural 
Harmony Foods will offer Pork Patties, Chicken Patties, Chicken Strips and Beef 
Meatballs.  These new products have now been developed using all-natural 
meats.  Broadening the line will increase brand visibility and revenue per 
store stocking without a significant increase in introductory costs.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The Company also plans to introduce 
other new products and services within the next two years: a) “Good Things Meet” 
product line – a line of frozen full meals, which like SoyLean<SUP>®</SUP> are 
high in protein, low in fat, low in saturated fat and meet the requirements of 
the "Heart-Healthy" claim.  In these entrees, the “SoyLean<SUP>®</SUP>” 
protein component will be complemented with healthful side dishes containing 
fiber, lycopene and high anti-oxidant ingredients; b) Food Services to 
restaurants, including fast-food chains, school systems, country clubs and 
hospitals.  Natural Harmony has already initiated a successful positioning 
effort for its products with several of the major players in this services 
market.</SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">There is an 
obesity trend that has reached epidemic proportions in all of the Western 
nations.<SPAN style="COLOR: red">  </SPAN>There are more than 100 million 
Americans with high cholesterol, and more than 30 million obese children.  
These demographics present a huge target market for Natural Harmony. Consumers 
with high cholesterol tend to watch their dietary intake to avoid cholesterol, 
and baby boomers do not like the fact that they are aging.  The recent 
heart problem experienced by President Clinton has been a further wake-up call 
for middle aged Americans.  These groups are the Company’s prime target 
market, a market that generated retail sales of over $90 billion in 
2003.</SPAN></P>

Strategy</SPAN></A></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Natural 
Harmony’s competitors produce either all-meat based or all vegetarian based 
products.  The Company believes this has created a gap in the market for 
consumers who enjoy the taste and texture of real meat, but want lower fat and 
are aware of the healthful benefits of soy.  Natural Harmony products 
represent a whole new category of products with this blending.  Consumer 
research and Natural Harmony’s experience confirm that consumers want healthier 
versions of familiar foods, which require little or no taste sacrifice.  
The Company’s strategy is to: a) Focus on major trends: Interest in healthier 
versions of familiar foods, which require little or no taste sacrifice, b) 
Create a new category: A hybrid of meat and soy, which has the taste and texture 
of the meat with the health attributes of soy protein, c) Create memorable brand 
names and become the leaders of this new category of foods, d) Preempt 
competitive entry with the timely development and introduction of an array of 
new products.</SPAN></P></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></B>
