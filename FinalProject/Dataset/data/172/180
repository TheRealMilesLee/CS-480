     Cohorts

      I have spoke with Richard Stallings (Cubix) this morning and I will receive a fax copy of the corrected test data for unit 703, station 7.  This revised information will support the 96 % torque load on this unit opposed to the 68 %.  I will get Larry and the Mountainair team a faxed copy, we need to make certain that we dispose of any of the information that supports the 68 % test data.

   Call if anyone has any questions.
