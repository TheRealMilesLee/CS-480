From desk of: Mrs. Susan Shabangu
16 MCKELELE Street.
CAPE TOWN. South Africa.

Dear Sir,

With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings, and I hope this mai=
l
meets you in good health.

However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have
not met personally or had any
dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its=

importance and the immense
benefit it will be to you and I.

After careful consideration with my children, we resolved to contact you
for your most needed assistance in this manner. I duly apologize for infr=
inging
on your privacy if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this
proposal to you as a person of integrity. I got your contacts through my
personal research and out of desperation decided to
reach you through this medium.

First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is=

Mrs. Susan Shabangu, mother of three and a civil servant working for the
Republic of South Africa for seven years. I will
now give you a general overview of the situation. When I was sworn in as
Deputy Minister of Minerals and
Energy in 1996, with my influence, my husband Mr. Simon Shabangu, a very
successful businessman was
awarded several contracts in my ministry and had direct dealings with for=
eign
investors in this field.
 
Due to my political status, I was not involved in my husbands business wh=
ich
was very vast and successful.
My beloved husband died whilst on an official trip to the Europe last yea=
r.

When my husband died, I was contacted as next of kin by a private securit=
y
firm in Europe to come forth with the Certificate of Deposit and claim a
safety deposit my husband has in their Vault in his name. 

I went through his library collection and to my astonishment I discovered=

a Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit with this private securit=
y
firm, and other documents relating to the safety deposit.

The safety deposit which is in a trunk contains the sum of $20,000,000 wh=
ich
was generated from cash payments from his business associates in the diam=
ond
trade from Antwerp, Belgium. Though I knew my late husband was in the dia=
mond
business, I did not have the knowledge that he moved funds in cash. 

This has came as a shock to me and my children, and we have decided to ha=
ve
this fund invested immediately in commercial and residential properties
abroad as well as profitable ventures, as any member of my family cannot
hold such a huge amount in our name due to my political status, hence we
sincerely propose to you to render us your most needed assistance in this=

regard.

If you agree to render us your assistance, your role in this project will=

be to act on my behalf as a trustee to receive the safety deposit contain=
ing
the funds from the Security firm. Though I believe this transaction shoul=
d
be based on mutual benefit and interest.  

For your reliable assistance, we are offering you 20% of the funds. I tha=
nk
you in advance as we anticipate 
your assistance in enabling us achieve this goal. On hearing from you, I
will forward your contact to our
Personal Assistant who will be representing us, and also work with you to=

actualise this transaction.

He will be working with you for a mutual conclusion of the process and I
look forward to a long lasting business relationship with you. As you may=

understand, due to my sensitive position in the present government, it is=

not safe to communicate with me via phone or fax. This is why I have comm=
unicated
with you with my private email address, and I like us to keep it this way=
,
for the safety of this transaction. Whether or not you are interested in
assisting us please let
us know. This will enable us make alternative plans, in the event of non-=
interest
on your part.

Please respond via this private e-mail address :  susan_shabangu@hotmail.=

With warm regards,

Mrs. S. Shabangu.
