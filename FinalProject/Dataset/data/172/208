Thanks for including me on the distribution.

I am fine with the draft press release and have no comments thereon other than to suggest that you include an investor relations contact at the top of the page (either Lawrence or I). 

If talking points are available with additional background information on the credit facility, I would appreciate if you could forward a copy prior to the release.

Kind Regards.
