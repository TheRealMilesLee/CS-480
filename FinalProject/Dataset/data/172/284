FROM:MR. CHEUNG PUI 
Hang Seng Bank Ltd 
Sai Wan Ho Branch 
171 Shaukiwan Road 
Hong Kong. 
Email: cheungpui01@katamail.com

Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Cheung Pui director of 
operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branch. I have an 
obscured business suggestion for you. 

Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Basem who was with 
the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit 
for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four millions Five 
Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity 
several notice was sent to him, even during the war early last year. 
Again after the war another notification was sent and still no 
response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his 
family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their 
home. 

After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi 
Basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including 
the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the 
last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his 
deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand 
United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will 
ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that 
according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 4 years 
the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if 
nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my 
suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as 
the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that you will be able to 
receive his funds. 

WHAT IS TO BE DONE: 

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we 
shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will 
prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of 
kin to Major Fadi Basem , all that is required from you at this stage 
is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the 
attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of 
kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and 
secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for 
the move of the funds to account that will be provided by you. 

There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a 
legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary 
documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters 
concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your 
nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% 
for you . Should you be interested please send me your full names and 
current residential address and I will prefers you to reach me on the 
email address (cheungpui01@katamail.com) and finally after that i 
shall provide you with more details of this operation. 

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated. 

Kind Regards 

Mr. Cheung Pui
