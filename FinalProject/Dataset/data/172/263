John, so far, we have been able to get 1998 back for you, it is located at \\nahou-dv16\dpr98, you can either click this link or go to Start, Run and type in the link.

We are working on getting 1999, the files were archived on another server which has been decommissioned, we have the files on tape which we will have to retrieve the data from.

I will let keep you informed of our progress.


Thank You

Frank, could you please give me access to the files in the following location:

m:\common\power\position\dpr\1998\
m:\common\power\position\dpr\1999\

We have already got access to the 2000 folder.

John
