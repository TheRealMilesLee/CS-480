They are correct, Cilco city gate does not exist....the only reference point is the Nicor city gate.  As far as the guarant, I'm okay, but the last time we asked them to draft the guarantee, it was horrible.  I'll ask them to send us a draft.

Call me when you get a chance.

thanks

 Regarding the GISB,  issues remaining are Section 3.2 Performance Obl. and their Guaranty.

We prefer Spot Standard for Section 3.2 however, they argue the Cilco city gate does not have a "Spot Market" .  If the city gate is their end user I will give on this point.  Tammy is checking on this.  The only other issue is their Guaranty to Enron.  I have no problem with amending the gty or putting a new one in place.  Having said that, I would prefer they draft the amendment.  This of course is contingent on credits ok with the change in the gty amount.

FYI, I will be out to the office tomorrow afternoon for meetings. If you need me leave a message with my assistant and I will call you back.
