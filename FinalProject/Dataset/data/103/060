Subject:  Increased Security at Enron Centers

	Late on 25 October, we received information about a possible threat to the Enron Building.  We are in touch with local law enforcement authorities who have informed us that this threat remains unsubstantiated.   Nonetheless, we take all threats seriously as the security of our employees and facitlites is paramount.  Therefore, we have increased the security posture at the Enron Centers, including an increased HPD presence.  

	We will keep all employees apprised of any new developments as they occur.
