Here are the preliminary reports ready for your review.  I have done a thorough analysis on Items 2 and 3 and feel very confident with the data.  I will be finalizing my review of contract volume data in Item 1 no later than tomorrow and will advise if any changes are necessary.

TK - Please update the daily rates for contract 27495 (Astra) and verify the rates in blue.  Additionally, please verify that the discounted IT rates for contract 20248 and 22136 are correct as billed (it doesn't appear that these discounts appeared in the daily transactional report postings).

I need all updates/comments no later than COB Monday, 10/29/01.

 



Thanks,
Elizabeth
