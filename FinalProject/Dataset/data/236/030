Hello,
I hope you will not receive this proposal too surprising. I got your 
contact E-mail address in the Internet while searching for a 
trustworthy business partner who I can entrust a reasoning amount of 
money on his or her care for investment.
I am a Liberian and a cabinet member of President Charles Taylor's 
administration. I am presently in the republic of (SAO TOME) under 
polical asylum status because of the on going war in Liberia. For your 
information I have secured and sent abroad the sum of $12,000,000.00 
(TWELVE MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLAR) through a diplomatic means. The 
fund is presently under the custody of a diplomatic storage company in 
oversea. The money was originally meant for the purchase of arms and 
ammunition to fight the rebel groups in Liberia but from the look of 
things it is like we cannot continue with the war because of the 
intervention of President George Bush of America .As a result of the 
present development I now send the money abroad for my personal 
investment without the knowledge of our Government.
My main purpose of writing you is to seek your partnership if you could 
make claim of the money from the diplomatic storage company as the 
beneficiary for 
the benefit of both us. I am willing to discuss sharing ratio in any 
reliable business you would embark.
Details of how you are going to claim the money in consignment from the 
diplomatic storage company will be made known to you as soon as you 
indicate your interest 
in this transaction.
kindly confirm the following to me.
1. Your confirmation or your ability to handle this.
2. Your word that you will keep this business as confidential as 
possible at all times until we conclude this business.
3. Your telephone and fax numbers for communication.
4. Your full permanent address.
As soon as I get the above information from you, I
will disclose to you the country of the
Diplomatic storage company .i will also forward your name and
particulars to the diplomatic storage company to enable them
contact you accordingly. 
I look forward to hear from you.
Mr Johnson Oloshe
