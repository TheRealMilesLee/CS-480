Rod,

Per our conversations yesterday there is one other item that we would like to obtain: the current percentage ROE and return on rate base allowed by FERC.  If there is someone in your organization that I can contact please let me know.

Thank you for all of your help!  I hope that you get to relax and enjoy at least some of your holiday.

Regards,
Sarah
