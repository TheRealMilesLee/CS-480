Not knowing exactly what model Compaq laptop Bill has makes this an educated guess on my part.  First of all, all new laptops came with both CD and floppy drives so if he is the orginal owner have him check in the bag.  If it was a redeployed system he may not have received all the pieces.  With that said, an internal floppy drive will run about $75 for the Compaq M700 laptop. Other models may vary in price a bit but probably not by much.

Bill Rapp's laptop (Compaq) is not equipped with the device that allows a 3.5" diskette to be loaded.  He can run CDs, but not diskettes.  What do we need to order and how much will it cost?  Thanks.
