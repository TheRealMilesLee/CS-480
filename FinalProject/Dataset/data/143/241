Tom,
Currently, voluntary severence is not used in North America.  If that changes, I will let you know.  Thank you.

Jeanie,

In light of the layoffs that are coming on Monday, if HR is looking for people to layoff, is it  possible to volunteer for the severence package.

Please call if you have any questions.
