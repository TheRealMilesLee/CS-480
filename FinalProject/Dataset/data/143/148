Monika -

I received some info today in the mail regarding a new master of science
program in quantitative financial economics. It is being offered by
Oklahoma State University and they have a lot of money for financial
support. Perhaps you should consider it.

If you send me your address, I will mail the information off to you
today.

Have a great Thanksgiving.

Jim
