Return-Path: Kevin_Howard@ENRON.net

For TW:
Rate Baese = $465 million
Cap structure =  42 / 58 debt / equity
overall return = 10.29%
Return on equity = 11.5%
Note: the only "official" numbers are in the RP93-34 rate case settlement and reflect $68 million pre-tax return, 14.65% pre-tax return percentage and the 11.5%  ROE mentioned above.

I have more detailed rate information (tariff pages, TW Rate presentation) - just tell me how much data you need.

Kevin

Rod,

Per our conversations yesterday there is one other item that we would like to obtain: the current percentage ROE and return on rate base allowed by FERC.  If there is someone in your organization that I can contact please let me know.

Thank you for all of your help!  I hope that you get to relax and enjoy at least some of your holiday.

Regards,
Sarah
