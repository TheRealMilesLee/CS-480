     Hi, Steve - 
     
     I've been thinking of you quite a bit over the past few months as the 
     Enron woes have unfolded and finally decided to drop you a line.  I 
     hope you're keeping your legendary sense of perspective.  One of the 
     things I have admired about you is that you never lose sight of the 
     fact that people make an organization successful, a lesson many of 
     your Enron peers apparently have yet to learn.  Maybe it comes from 
     having priorities other than making money ot being powerful, but my 
     conversations with friends demonstrates that they still appreciate 
     your loyalty to your staff.
     
     Philadelphia agrees very well with Michael and me.  We're getting 
     ensconced in our house and adjusting to life in the 'burbs.  
     Fortunately, we're in Bryn Mawr, where we have a college town, rather 
     than suburban, environment.  In fact, we are within three miles of 
     four four-year colleges!  I've seen Mike Terrasso at some of the EHS 
     meetings - what a thoughtful, gentle man.  
     
     Although I miss some of the excitement and intellectual stimulation of 
     working at Enron, I don't miss Houston (except for the people).  
     However, I'm energized by the notion of incorporating EHS excellence 
     into a coherent management system that focuses on improving the bottom 
     line, and I'm enjoying the challenge of managing a large staff again.  
     Given all of the recent consolidation in the refining industry, I'm 
     thankful for Sunoco's strong perfromance over the past couple of years 
     and hope that we can remain independent for a few more years.
     
     Do let me know if you get to the East Coast.  We'd love to take you to 
     dinner.
     
     Take care, and hang in there!
     
     Carolyn
