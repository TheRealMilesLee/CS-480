FYI --- 

GISB and the DOE are sponsoring an industry-wide meeting that will be facilitated by: 

Electric Power Supply Assoc. 
Electricity Consumers Resource Council 
National Energy Marketers Assoc. 


The announcement and agenda are included in the attachment.  The organizational structure will be discussed as well as the types of standards that should be addressed.  They seem to be moving rather quickly -- possibly in response to NERC's announcement that they plan to expand their role.  ???
