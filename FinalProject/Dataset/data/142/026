Michelle, when we were checking out 280G issues, we came across this.  I am worried because it appears they slipped in a UK citizen.....we did not run the traps on the U.K.  I fear the worst!!!!  Since I have not given Wachovia the names yet we could remedy but need to move fast......I hesitate to call anyone until we can touch base given the sensitivity.  Also, how will we pay from the Trust and not let Europe know....they'll be wanting to pay him too!!!!  Please advise.

Hope you are enjoying the cruise.

Pam,

Attached is a file that calculates the average salary over the last 5 years based information provided by payroll.  If all five years were not available, then the average is based on the number of years available (i.e. 3 years of information received from payroll, then average is total salary divided by 3).  See the worksheet labeled average calc to find the calculation of the 2.99.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  The highlighted employees are those that US payroll did not have any information.  I noted in the comment column that they were Canadian employees or UK.  I checked with Tim Callahan and Richard Lewis is not an expat.
