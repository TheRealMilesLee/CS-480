Lynn, do you have any more of these pens.  If so, could you send me 7 or 8.  If not I'll just order them.

I received a pen at your meeting in Houston a couple of weeks ago and had
received a pen that lights up.  The guys over here have been bugging me to
find out if you have anymore available.  If not do not worry about it. 

Thanks
Scott

P.S. When does Lorraine return to work
