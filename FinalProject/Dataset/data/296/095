PRINCE OMAR,
INTERNATIONAL REFUGEE,
CAMP BURKINA FASO.


Dear Friend,

May I introduce myself,My name is  Prince  Omar  ,a Sierra Leonia residing 
in Burkina-Faso ,West  Africa. You will be surprise to receive this mail 
from a total stranger like me, Anyway, I got your contact through internet 
and decided to approach you for assistance.

My father, The late Dr. Omar  ,was one of the prominent Diamond dealers in 
my  country Sierra Leone,  He was also one of the paramount chiefs in my 
town before he was murdered in cold blood early last year alongside with my 
mother by the Rebels of R.U.F when they invaded the town. When I got home 
from school to see the remains of my  late father and other  family members, 
I discovered that my home had been burnt down and my parents were both 
murdered by the Rebels of R.U.F that has been fighting against the 
legitimate Government in my country since  1992.

  My late father deposited the sum of(USD$25million) as a FAMILY TREASURE IN 
A TRUST COMPANY here in Burkina-Faso, West Africa before his untimely death, 
this money was meant to be used to build an ultra modern medical Clinic here 
in Burkina-Faso for me after I shall have completed my studies as a 
qualified Doctor but untimely death of my parents have denied me this good 
opportunity

Now, as the next of kin and the only child;  I am to make the claim  and the 
ownership of the box containing the money  although the people in the Trust  
Company are not aware of the contents of the box, But I need a reliable 
person outside Africa through whom I could move the money abroad and who 
will subsequently help me to invest the money wisely while I go back to 
school to complete my education.

Bear in mind that I would  entrust this money in your hands if you would be 
willing to help me in this matter. I am also willing to give you 35% of the 
total sum if you will be willing to assist me in this matter. In addition 5% 
will be of the expenses  incurred in the course of moving this money abroad 
to your account. If you can assist, please get back to me promptly through 
my e-mail address so that we can discuss the modalities of making this move. 
I  will equally insist that you make it a very private and confidential 
matter.
I look  forward  to hear  from you  soonest.
Thanks
Prince Omar.
