We want to update you on a development related to tuition reimbursement.  As we look for ways to operate more efficiently through restructuring, the company has decided to immediately suspend tuition reimbursement.  If you have received approval for tuition reimbursement for Spring or Summer coursework, the company will honor those commitments.  Any costs incurred for future courses will not be reimbursed.  If you have questions about this change, please contact your Human Resource representative.
