FROM MR ANDY BELLO
THE AUDITOR/ ACCOUNTANT GENERAL.

BANK COTONOU BENIN REPUBLIC
WEST AFRICA.
TEL:+229 457965

Dear Friend,

I am Andy Bello, the personal accountant to Mr. Ramesh J Singh, who used to work
with Oil consultant/contractor with the Benenoise Solid Minerals Corporation in
Cotonou, Benin Republic.

On the 25th December 2003, my client, his wife and their two children were
involved in an Air Crash,who unfortunately died in the plane crash of Union
Transport Africaines Flight Boeing 727 in Cotonou, Benin Republic on the
december 25,2003, when going hollidays to Lebanon.

You will read more stories about the crash on visiting this website:

www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/ story.html

www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/

All occupants of the all unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made
several enquiries if I can locate any of my clients extended relatives this has
also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, to locate
any member of his family hence I contacted you.

I Further investigations,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was
fruitless.Again,I made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Ramesh
J.Singh did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official
documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.

This sum of US$7,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank No one will ever come
forward to claim it. According to the International Banking ethics,codes and
Laws, at the expiration of 2(Two) years, the money will revert to the ownership
of the Benin Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as
the next of kin to Mr.Ramesh J.Singh This is simple, I will like you to respond
immediately with your full names and address so that we will prepare the
necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of
kin. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then
facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60%
for me and  35% for you and 5% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the
transaction .

All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I
guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will
protect you from any breach of the law. All documents of transaction will be
destroyed immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place.Get
back to me through my private email box:andy_bello57@hotmail.com


If this Offer is acceptable to you, kindly send your following information
stated blow:

a. Your full name and Address
b. Private telephone number
c. Private fax numbers
d. Private email

Have a nice day.
