Dear Sir,

I am Mr.Michael Bala, a Sierra Leonian by nationality. Presently I am 
residing in a neighbouring Benin Republic on exile.

After the war that ravaged my country for a couple of years, most of us in 
the military are under very tight scrutiny and constant oppression, thus 
necessitating my fleeing to Cotonou for safety.

I have certain amount of money to the tune of $15M (Fifteen Million United 
States Dollars), in a security and finance company in Europe with which I 
wish to invest in a related area of my interest which is acquisition of 
real estate/buying franchise of one or two of your products which will be 
exported to popular African markets that commands large demand of such 
products.

This will be done on your personal advice. Therefore if you indicate 
interest to fashion me with investment advice, I will be glad to receive 
your kind response through e-mail for further explanation regarding my
request.

Regards and God bless you

Mr.Michael Bala.
