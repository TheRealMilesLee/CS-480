Kim:
       In this morning's Chronicle, in the Viewpoints section, is an article 
you should read -- about the high quality employees Enron has so carefully 
selected over the years.  Be sure and read it -- you'll be glad you did.
       Hope things 'settle down' at work for you and your co-workers.  I've 
been through 'trying' times in the past when I was with NASA, and I can tell 
you that it will work out for you, I'm sure.  
Fondly,  
Hattie Thurlow-McKinley
