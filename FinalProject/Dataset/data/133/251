Attn: Pls,

I am Hans Clinton, a solicitor of Hans chambers and personal attorney to late Engr. Paul Erick Siersted, a Danish national. I decided to reach you via your e-mail address, which is most confidential that normal postage.

I wish to notify you that my client died at the age of 73 in the year 2004 after suffering from desophagi cancer. He had two children and wife who died in a plane crash on Jan. 31, 2000, off Oxnard, Calif.: Aboard Alaska Airways flight originating in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and scheduled to stop in San Francisco and then Seattle, crashed in the Pacific. All 88 people aboard killed including the (wife and children), website:http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0801250.

Late Engr. Paul Erick Siersted who was born on June 19, 1931 and passed away on February 8, 2004 at the age of 73 http://www.memoryofu.com/Public/Default2.html was a philanthropist who touched lives of people, left the sum of ninety eighth million dollar($98,000.00) to a person with a Netherlands address. But unfortunately for over a year the person could not be traced as the address he gave in his last testament is the address of Catholic Monks. The information is that the person does not exist. Every other instructions in his last testament has been executed accordingly with exception of the ($98,000.00 ) which is kept in the bank.

In view of the above information of non existing person, and since both your last name are the same, you are the person who can assist in getting the fund out. I will provide and generate other document from the probate for the 100% free from law and success of the deal. And other information can be verified from memoryofu. We shall distribute 30% of the entire fund to charity and split the remaining 70% in the ratio of 50/50.

Please if I reach you as I am hopeful endeavor to get back to me as soon as possible to enable the immediate execution to avoid loosing the sum to the finance company. I will also need your full names, contact address,private telephone number, and copy of your national ID or international passport or drivers license.You are strictly advised to reply through my private email box: barristerhansclinton1@yahoo.co.uk


Regards,
Barrister Hans Clinton Esq.
