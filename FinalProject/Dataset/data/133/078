                      Small slot.
                   Big possiblities.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear Jess,

Open up a whole world of functionality and flexibility 
with one of our new expandable Palm(tm) handhelds. The 
Palm m125, m500 and m505 handhelds all feature an 
expansion slot which lets you add storage, back up 
data and even carry around eBooks, travel guides, 
games, and much more. Simply slip in the SD/MultiMedia 
Card of your choice and you're ready to read, play, 
connect and, of course, organize. Each MultiMedia card 
is about the size of a postage stamp.

Now's the perfect time to upgrade to one of these 
three ultra-expandable models because until November 
30, we're bundling them with some terrific FREE extras. 
Only available through the Palm Store.
