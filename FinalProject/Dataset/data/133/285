Subject: [Footballguys] Breaking News - Correll Buckhalter Trouble

Entire story:  http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1117/1279805.html


Leading rusher Correll Buckhalter is among three rookie players suspended
for one game by Philadelphia Eagles head coach Andy Reid on Saturday after a
Friday night incident in which the trio was taken into custody on possible
drug charges.

None of the players will participate in Sunday's game at Dallas, nor will
they be allowed to even make the trip, as the result of the team action.

ESPN.com has learned that safety Terrence Carroll, an undrafted free agent
from Oregon State, is the only one of the players who will be charged. The
players were stopped Friday night as they drove on South Street, a trendy
area of shops and clubs, and police detected an odor of marijuana.

Carroll is expected to be charged with marijuana possession and he remains
in custody pending bond. Buckhalter and cornerback Darrel Crutchfield, an
undrafted free agent from Clemson, were released on Saturday morning and
will not face charges. Carroll was to have been deactivated for the game at
Dallas and might not have made the trip anyway.

"We are obviously aware of the incident involving three of our first-year
players last night in Philadelphia," said Reid in a statement released by
the club. "I've met with the players that I could meet with this morning and
they will be suspended for this Sunday's game. . . . We will not have any
further comment on this matter and we will handle the rest of this situation
internally."

The players will each be docked $12,294, the equivalent of one game check
based on their rookie minimum base salaries of $209,000. More significant
for Carroll is that he almost certainly will be in violation of the NFL's
personal conduct policy and may also have violated the substance abuse
policy.

A fourth-round draft choice from Nebraska, the hard-running Buckhalter has
rushed for 428 yards and two touchdowns on 92 carries this year, starting
several games in place of the injured Duce Staley. Although Staley has
returned to the starting lineup, and had his best game of the season last
week, Buckhalter is still a key part of the Eagles offense.

Shaking the head here.   Bottom line is this has a positive effect on
Staley.

Thanks to Footballguy Mike Green for pointing me to this one.
