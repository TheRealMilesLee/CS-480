Subject: [Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Wheatley to Miss "About a Month"

Wheatley to Miss "About a Month"

Entire story:   http://espn.go.com/nfl/columns/pasquarelli_len/1265229.html

Clipped from the Len Pasquarelli article from 10-17:

It looks like Oakland Raiders coach Jon Gruden won't have the luxury of
playing running back roulette, often rotating between Tyrone Wheatley and
Charlie Garner depending on the game situation and formation, for about the
next month.

Sources told ESPN.com that Wheatley likely will miss three to four weeks
with a right knee sprain suffered in Sunday night's road victory at
Indianapolis. An examination indicated there is no significant structural
damage, but Wheatley will need rest and rehabilitation. Oakland has a bye
this week and resumes play Oct. 28 at Philadelphia.

Wheatley apparently injured the knee on his third carry of the game, but
kept playing. Two fourth-quarter errors, a fumble that led to a Colts
touchdown and a dropped pass that forced the Raiders to punt, drew the ire
of Gruden. The two had words on the sideline, Wheatley threw his helmet to
the bench and did not return.

The seventh-year veteran is said to be frustrated not only by the injury,
but also by what he feels is diminished playing time, and the perception
Gruden regards Garner as a better fit for the Oakland offense.

Wheatley started the Sunday night game, but Garner opened the previous two
contests, and the players started the first two games of the year in tandem.
Although Wheatley has more rushes than Garner (55-53), the latter has more
"touches" (72-63), because of his abilities as a receiver.

The Raiders have used Garner at tailback, slot receiver and wide receiver,
and it appears his versatility is well-suited to an offense that utilizes a
dizzying assortment of formations and shifts.

The absence of Wheatley could further stymie a running game that has lacked
the power of a year ago. The Raiders are statistically ranked 19th in
rushing after leading the league in 2000. Oakland is averaging just 98.2
rushing yards per game and 3.4 yards per carry. In the first five games last
year, the Raiders averaged 123.8 yards per game and 4.1 yards per attempt.

Gruden has worked No. 3 tailback Randy Jordan into the lineup in certain
situations and said earlier this week he wants to get the versatile Terry
Kirby involved as well. Kirby does not have a rushing attempt this season.

Clearly, huge news for Garner.   We've been hyping him as the guy who'll see
more and more carries and I think that would have happened even without the
Wheatley injury.   Garner will obviously benefit from the increased playing
time.   Wheatley owners go to the backup plan and you other folks may
consider making a move for Garner.

More as we hear it.
