What do you want to drink?  I think Greg (Corinnes husband) is 
getting a Keg, Scotch and alot of wine!  I have wine and Vodka at my 
house (gotta have a pre-party cocktail), so if you want something 
else tell me now!!  Other than that, I am bringing Brie, and I think 
that will cover our part.  If you can't get ahold of me Saturday 
afternoon, call my cell, because Greg cannot drive and I have to take 
him on some errands for the party.
