In two weeks it will already be time to turn in the donations for the American Heart Association.  Please encourage your teams to get as many donations as possible.  Please send me the name and sizes (Large or Extra Large ONLY) for your walkers today.  Don't forget to keep track of the Enron Employees donations so they can be matched.  

I will have the shirts available to pick up on bank day (Oct. 30) when you turn your money in.  

Thanks again for volunteering to be captains.
Sue
