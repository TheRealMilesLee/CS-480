Most of what we'll see are properties I have already sent you, but I can send them again if you like.  What time did you have in mind.  Anytime is good for me.

Let's look to try and meet early rather than later, but who knows.  Also what about lining up properties between $200,000 and $350,000.  Thenw eeding them out based upon age and number of bedrooms (3).  If you can shoot us the listings first so Mark and I can narrow them down to around 10.
 
 
Thanks
Paul

Paul,
 
Sunday's good, let me know if you need to change, otherwise I'll set up about 8 or 10 places to see.
