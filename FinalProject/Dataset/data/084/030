   Subject:    Credit Derivatives Issue
   
   You should be aware that an issue is currently under extensive debate
   in the
   credit derivative area resulting from the insolvency of Railtrack in
   the UK.
   ISDA has been asked by some participants in the market to make a
   statement
   regarding a provision of its Credit Derivatives Definitions. Others
   are
   either still considering their position or would prefer that ISDA not
   issue
   a statement. 
    
   Specifically, the discussion relates to the deliverability of
   convertible
   bonds of Railtrack. There is no dispute that a Credit Event occurred.
   What
   is in dispute is whether the bonds satisfy the definition of "Not
   Contingent" under the Definitions, which is a characteristic
   typically
   required of deliverable obligations. This characteristic requires
   that the
   payment or repayment of principal on the bonds not be subject to a
   contingency. The bonds are convertible into equity of Railtrack at
   the
   option of the holder or, in certain limited circumstances, at the
   option of
   the trustee for the bondholder. The provision for the trustee to
   exercise
   the conversion (sometimes referred to as a "widows and orphans"
   clause) is a
   standard clause in bonds issued in England and is intended to protect
   bondholders who may have inadvertently failed to exercise their
   conversion
   right when it would be clearly beneficial economically for them to do
   so. In
   the case of Railtrack, conversion would not have been economically
   beneficial at any time recently, but nevertheless the right of the
   trustee
   to convert exists.
    
   A draft statement has been prepared for consideration by the Credit
   Derivatives Market Practice Committee, which I have attached for your
   review. The statement refers to two documents that are in draft form,
   the
   User's Guide to the Definitions (which is scheduled to be published
   in the
   next week or two) and a Supplement currently under consideration by
   the
   "group of six" subgroup of the Committee. In each of these documents,
   we
   suggest that "plain vanilla" convertible bonds should satisfy the
   "Not
   Contingent" characteristic and should, therefore, be deliverable.
   "Plain
   vanilla" convertible bonds for this purpose include bonds where
   conversion
   is at the option of the holder of the trustee.
    
   A meeting of a number of dealers based in London (not an ISDA
   meeting) is
   scheduled for Tuesday. It is not likely that we will publish anything
   prior
   to that meeting.
    
   I would appreciate your views on whether we should issue any
   statement
   regarding this situation. We are continuing to poll members for their
   views
   on whether this type of market statement would be appropriate. We are
   also
   discussing with Allen & Overy and with Clifford Chance and Linklaters
   how we
   might achieve a legal basis for making the statement. Please share
   your
   views with the other addressees of this email, as they are
   coordinating the
   views of members.
    
   Bob
