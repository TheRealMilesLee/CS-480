Hello, 
I am Mrs Maryam Abacha the wife of late head of state Federal Republic of Nigeria I got your e-mail from search engine. Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the–late former head of state of Nigeria in June 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country. 

As a widow that is so traumatized,I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there and many outrightly blackmail us.In fact the total sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poorfor life.You may be surprise how I got to know but I will tell you when you reply. 

I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you. Due to security network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you.I have deposited the sum of U.S 40.3 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is witheld for now until we open communication. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safe keeping.This arrangement is known to you and my Attorney alone, so my Attorney will deal directly with you as security is up my whole being.The name of my Attorney his Giwe Calorie. Please honesty is the watch word in this transaction. 
I will like you to provide me immediately the following information. 
1. Full names 
2. Contact address 
3. Telephone and fax numbers 
4. Location 
so that we can commence communication immediately.In case you don‘t accept please don‘t let me out to the security.I will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith.Please expedite action. hajiawithyouu@yahoo.com

Sincerely yours 

Hajia Maryam Abacha
