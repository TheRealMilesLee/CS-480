Attn:
I am Barrister Bello Dangote. the lawyer to the widow of
the Late Gen. Sanni
Abacha former Nigerian Military Head of State who
died mysteriously as a
result of Cardiac Arrest. 
Since after her husband's death, her family has been
under restriction of
movement and that not withstanding, they are being
molested, and their Bank
Account both here and abroad are being frozen by the
Nigerian Civilian Government.
Furthermore,her elder son is in

detention by the Nigerian Government for more
interrogation about her husband's
assets and some vital documents.


Following the recent discovery of her husband's Bank
Account by the Nigerian
Government with Swiss Bank in which the huge sum of
US$700 MILLION and DM
450 Million was logged. I therefore decided to
contact

you in confidence that she was able to move out the
sum of US$11 Million
Dollars, which was secretly sealed in two Metal
Boxes for security reasons.

 

I therefore personally, appeal to you seriously and
religiously for your
urgent assistance to move this money into your
country where I believe it
will be safe since she cannot leave the country due
to the

restriction of movement imposed on the members of
her family by the Nigerian
Government.


However, arrangements have been put in place to move
this money out of the
country in a secret vault through a diplomatic
courier service with the
help of a security company.

As soon as you indicate your interest forward to me
your telephone and fax
numbers, your postal address so that I can send to
you the Air-Way Bill
of the Luggage and other related documents that can
help you claim the Luggage.

 

Conclusively, we have agreed to offer you 10% of the
total sum while 90%
is to be held on trust by you until we can decide on
a suitable business
investment in your country subsequent to her free
movement by

the Nigerian Government.

Please reply urgently and treat with absolute
confidentiality and sincerety.
Please send your reply to:bellodangote@ny.com
 

Best Regards.

Barrister Bello Dangote.
