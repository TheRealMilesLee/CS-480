Dear,

My name is Mr.Franklin Joe, and I work in the International Operation D=
epartment in a Bank here in South Africa. On a routine inspection I dis=
covered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. Of 36,000,000 (Thirty=
 Six Million USD) on further discreet investigation, I also discovered =
that the account holder has long since passed away (dead) leaving no be=
neficiary to the account. The bank will approve this money to any forei=
gner because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner and from Ira=
q in particular and I am certainly sure that he is dead, and nobody wil=
l come again for the claim of this money A foreigner can only claim thi=
s money with legal claims to the account Holder, therefore I need your =
cooperation in this transaction.=20

I will provide the necessary information needed in order to claim this =
money, But you will need to open an account where this can be transferr=
ed. If interested send your private Telephone No. And Fax number includ=
ing full details of the account to be used for the Deposit I wish for u=
tmost confidentiality in handling this transaction as my job and the fu=
ture of my family would be jeopardized if it were breached.=20

I want to assure you that the transaction is without risk if due proces=
s is followed accordingly. Finally, I will give you 25% for your corpor=
ation.Contact immediately for more information.=20

Sincerely,=20

Mr.Franklin Joe.
