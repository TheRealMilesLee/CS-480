Please see the excerpt for Kenneth Cessac's weekly report addressing the leaking valve at Milagro. Since we are unable to quantify the amount of leakage, no PPAs for previous months  will be made.

SOUTHWEST TEAM

UAF: 
*  TW system:  a leaking valve has been identified as a contributor to the TW gain; the valve is on a station bypass line around station 9207 (receipt into TW system).  Problem has been corrected as of 7/10/01; we were not able to quantify leakage;  we'll have to wait until next month to note results of this find.  
* as a result of the Albq. Regional uaf mtg (7/12/01), arrangements are being made for audit teams to review all stations greater than 50,000 mcf/day.
*Participated/Witnessed a station assessment at NNG/Transok I/C at Roger Mills #1 compressor station, personnel from Energox conducted the assessment, I will share their information if provided.
* at the Albq Regional uaf mtg, the new PGAS balance report was reviewed for correctness; station 01086 (Duke/WT1 Interconnect-receipt station) was omitted from the June TW balance report; this correction will reduce gain
