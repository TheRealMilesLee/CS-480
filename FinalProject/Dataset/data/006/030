Attn: My Dear, 
 
 Compliments, I barrister ABEL have decided to bestow this trust on you,
which I pray you will not ignore or betray. I appologise in advance for
any inconviniences this may cause you. 

I am Barrister ABEL UDOKA the Personal Attorney to late Mr. Richard K. Wi=
lliam,
who was a contractor here in Benin Rep. And on the 3rd of Oct 2001, my cl=
ient,
and his family were perished in a ghostly car accident along Midombo Togo=

express way. As a matter of fact, my client made a fixed dopsit Amount,
valued at (USD$10.7M) with Legend Trust Bank here in Cotonou Benin Rep,
and upon the maturity time of their agreement, his bank started contactin=
g
him but no response. Conseqently, the bank issued me a notice to provide
 the next of kin to the deceased  as his personal attorney, or have his
account confiscated after four years, as it is in the law of this country=
.

 
Since then, I have made several contacts to His Countries Embassy in orde=
r
to locate any of my clients extended relatives, which had also been unsuc=
cessful.
Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating  the relatives for over two ye=
ars
now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the decease=
d
since none of his relatives were no way to be found so that the proceeds
of this account valued at $10.7m could be transffered into your account,
thereafter, we will both share it in percentage according to our contribu=
tions
to boost the success of this great transaction. I have all the necessary
legal documents that can be used to back up all the claims we will make.

I know that you might be wonder why I have decided to trust you with this=

huge sum, but the truth is that I need you to get this money out and cons=
idering
the fact that you are a foreigner which makes it a lot easier and straigh=
t
forward. 
All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us make this great ben=
efiting
transaction successfully. I guarantee you that this will be executed unde=
r
a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of th law.=

 
Please get in touch with me as fast as possible through my private :E-mai=
l
address: barristerabeludoka@echina.com  or through phone to enable us dis=
cuss
further the progress of this business. 

With best regards, 

Hon: ABEL UDOKA Esq,
Senior advocate of Benin (SAB).
