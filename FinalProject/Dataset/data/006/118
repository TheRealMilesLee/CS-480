FOREIGN NEXT-OF-KIN THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF THE BANK HAS MADE AN
ARRANGEMENT FOR THE FUNDS TO BE DECLARED UNCLAIMABLE AND SUBSEQUENTLY BE

HAVE YOU STAND AS THE NEXT-OF-KIN TO THE LATE DR. PETER LOMBARD WHO IS MY
CLIENT SO THAT THIS $15M WOULD BE TRANSFERRED AND PAID INTO YOUR BANK
ACCOUNT AS THE FOREIGN BENEFICIARY NEXT-OF-KIN. ALL PROVES TO ENABLE YOU
