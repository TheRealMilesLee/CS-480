Hi Jeff, hope the weekend was great.

With all the management and business changes in the organization the last few months, it might not be a bad idea to get everyone (say OOC at business units and higher, or like the old EI/ENA MD meeting in Cabo) to an offsite to do business reviews, and do some strategy work.  I certainly wouldn't mind getting away and talking to everyone for a couple of days.

Jeff
