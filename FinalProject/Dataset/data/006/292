Mark, we are trying to get some information on the Nymex Access Electronic Trading System. It is our understanding that during the day the electronic trading system cannot be used because all prices must be announced on the Trading floor so all members are aware of the prices at the same time. However, Nymex wants to use the Access system to post prices after trading hours. Does EnronOnline have any legal obstacles to overcome if we want to post our prices on Access and/or Nymex post their prices on EnronOnline? Thank you in advance for your assistance.
