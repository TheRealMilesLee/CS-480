That would be terrific!  I am right-handed and would like to borrow your
set of clubs (that way, I will not have to check in my luggage).  I will
have my own gloves and shoes.  Thanks again!

Michelle,
 
I called the Brookside Country Club today to see if they would rent you
a set of clubs.  Unfortunately, they do not have clubs to rent out. 
They suggested, if possible, you borrow a set from a friend.  
 
I'm not sure if renting from a friend is possible, but I do have a set
of clubs you could borrow.  They aren't the fanciest and they are
starting to show their age, but I would be glad to let you borrow them. 
Please give me a call if you are interested and I will bring them to the
golf outing.
