<P>Baltia Capital Investment Ltd., the leading private equity investor in the Baltic States, offers you an opportunity to join our team on a position of escrow affiliate. This home-based job does not require any in-depth knowledge of finance or a great investment of time. If you believe that you are an orderly and responsible person with some multi-task skills, this is a great opportunity for you to get a substantial additional income without much effort.</P>
<P>Looks like another work-by-email scam? Read on to find out why it is not.</P>
<P>ABOUT US</P>
<P>Baltia Capital Investment was founded in 1995 to provide exciting investment opportunities to institutions and individuals who believed in the potential of the emerging markets of Baltic States and former Soviet Union countries. Over the years, the performance of our funds remained ahead of the expectations of our investors, and we have built a healthy reputation in the Eastern European investment market.</P>
<P>We are now looking at establishing local presence in the US and Canada, where household investors grow dissatisfied with the financial market performance and standard investment vehicles. We are eager to offer private equity opportunities that combine our investment expertise and the amazing potential of the emerging markets. However, there is a major obstacle on our way: the 2001 Patriot Act. The grievous events of the September 2001 were not only a display of great villainess of the Islamic fundamentalism, but also a catalyst for the US market being effectively barred for the new European financial companies.</P>
<P>If you would like to learn more about our company, please feel free to visit us online at www.baltiacapital.com.</P>
<P>HOW YOU CAN HELP</P>
<P>At the moment, US Patriot Act forbids international clients to hold bank accounts in the US banks. All investment transactions made to Eastern European and Baltic companies by individuals are also subject to great and often unnecessary scrutiny, which brings a lot of inconvenience both to investment companies and their clients. As a small company working on a highly competitive market, we do not want to load our American clients, who are chiefly private, not-so-affluent investors with the additional expense associated with the upkeep of a duly registered US office. That is why we are looking for escrow agents in the USA and Canada who will be able to receive the electronic bank payments on behalf of our company and forward the funds to our client account, retaining an escrow commission.</P>
<P>WHAT YOU WILL NEED TO DO</P>
<P>As soon as you join our team, you will be assigned an Online Cabinet in our corporate website employee section. There you will be able to trace all payments made to your designated account for further transfer to the designated client investment account. You will also see the amount of the commission due to you, calculated on the basis of your experience of successful cooperation with our company. All you questions will be handled by your individual supervisor.</P>
<P>YOUR REWARD</P>
<P>Your escrow commission is calculated on the following table:</P>
<P>Amount transferred, total Commission rate </P>
<P>&lt;$50,000 10% </P>
<P>$50,000 - $150,000 12,5% </P>
<P>$150,000 - $500,000 15% </P>
<P>$500,000 and over 20% </P>
<P>Your escrow commission is deducted directly from the amount that you receive for further transfer. That means that you do not have to wait till the end of the month to receive your reward. Instead, you receive the commission as soon as you transfer the money to the client investment account.</P>
<P>EXAMPLE</P>
<P>Jill Escrow joins our company and receives a $35,000 payment from John Investor on the first week. Her commission constitutes 10% x $35,000 = $3500. She retains this amount and forwards the remaining $31,500 to the client investment account. Next week, she receives a $20,000. Her commission equals 10% x $15,000 + 12,5% x $5,000 = $2125.</P>
<P>WHATS NEXT</P>
<P>If you are tempted by the offer, feel free to email a brief resume to <a href="mailto:escrowprogram@baltiacapital.com">escrowprogram@baltiacapital.com</a> and a HR manager will be in touch with you shortly.</P></B></FONT></DIV><p>
