Kindly accept my apology for sending my mail to you.I Am a true God fearing person, and I want you to trust me and help me out in this my condition. I believe you are a highly respected personality, considering the fact that I sourced your profile from a human resource profile database on your country in the Internet.

Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in Liberia but it has formed consistent headlines in the CNN, BBC news bulletins.

My Name is MRS.SUZANA NUHAN VAYE from Liberia, a Country in West Africa. My late Husband is Issac Nuhan Vaye, Deputy Minister of Public Works in Liberia. My Husband was falsely accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him. You can verify this from some of the international newspapers posted in the web sites below:

(ii) http://www.unwire.org/UNWire/20030716/449_66 21.asp

Before my husband was killed, he moved out the sum of $21.5 million and large quantities of Diamonds through a diplomatic means, and deposited it with a Security Company Abroad.

All that is needed is for my lawyer to instruct the company to transfer the funds/diamonds to your account, I will remunerate you with 20% at the end, but most of all is that I solicit your trust in this transaction.I have been confined only to our country home and all my calls are monitored, So I will advise you contact my private Attorney on his contact stated below for onward proceedings: -
