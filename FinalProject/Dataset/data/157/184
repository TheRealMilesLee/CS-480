All:  I understand that Mirant, the buyer in our EcoElectrica deal, may have some outstanding trading exposure with Enron and/or its affiliates.  The issue has been raised of whether Mirant may attempt to offset amounts to which Mirant believes it is entitled against the $266 million purchase price that Mirant is obligated to pay an Enron affiliate in the EcoElectrica deal.  I understand that Enron has netting agreements in place with certain counterparties which may permit such offsets.  Which lawyer in the Enron trading world can help me determine what, if any, contractual arrangements are in place with Mirant that bear on this important issue?  Pls let me know.
