This spreadsheet should have everything for west power (Portland and San Fran) and for all people in Portland.  I have prepared it in a way so that it can be easily sorted.  Chris and I have reviewed and think that it is complete.

Jeanie, could you please ensure that the following people are on a netco list somewhere:
Dan Dietrich
Steve Walton
Murray O'Neil
Terry Donovan
Dale Furrow

Also, I think that Jeff Dasovich is slated to stay in San Fran to support the west gas desk.  I don't know if anyone has considered retention for him.

Finally, I put numbers down for the IT Development people in Portland.  I have no idea if those numbers are good or not.  Please run them by Steve Nat or compare them to someone in a similar role to see if they make sense.

PS - The outside e-mail address is my home e-mail so that I can review if you need me to discuss later.
