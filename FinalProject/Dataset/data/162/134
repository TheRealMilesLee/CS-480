DEAR SIR,

THIS EMAIL MIGHT COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE BUT I PLEAD WITH YOU TO READ BEFORE A DECISION TO ASSIST OR NOT. I WISH TO SOLICIT FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE IN A TRANSACTION, WHICH I STRONGLY BELIEVE WILL BE OF MUTUAL BENEFIT TO ALL PARTIES.

MY NAME IS MR. RICHARD DEWAR REGIONAL HEAD OF A LEADING BANK HERE IN SOUTH AFRICA. MY COLLEAGUES AND I WISH TO SEEK YOUR ASSISTANCE IN TRANSFER OF AN UNCLAIM INHERITANCE HUGE FUND.

THE SAID FUNDS WAS DEPOSITED FIVE YEARS AGO BY MR. JONAS SAVIMBI THE LEADER OF THE NATIONAL UNION FOR THE TOTAL INDEPENDECE OF ANGOLA (UNITA). THEY HAVE BEEN IN CONTROL OF A LARGE PART OF ANGOLA FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS UNTIL MR. SAVIMBI WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED IN COMBAT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT FORCES IN THE CENTRAL EASTERN PROVINCE OF MOXICO IN ANGOLA ON THE 22ND OF FERBRUARY 2002.

UNFORTUNATELY, HE COULD NOT LIVE UNTIL THE MATURITY OF THE FIX DEPOSIT IN OUR BANK WHICH WAS LAST YEAR. HE APPOINTED HIS FOREIGN PARTNER AS THE NEXT OF KIN TO THE DEPOSIT, BUT AFTER A SEROIUS RESEARCH WE FOUND OUT THAT NO ONE IS ACTUALLY AWARE OF THIS FUNDS AS THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT OF ANGOLA IS NOW CONFISCATING ANY PROPERTY OR ACCOUNT BELONGING TO MR. SAVIMBI. HOWEVER IF THE FUND IS UNCLAIM  AND DISCOVER BY RESEVER BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA IT WILL BE DONATED TO DR. NELSON MANDELA CHARITY ORGANIZATION, THIS IS THE REASON WE NEED THE FUNDS TO BE TRANSFER INTO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

ALL MODALITIES FOR THE SUCCESFUL TRANSFER OF THIS MONEY INTO AN OFFSHORE BANK ACCOUNT HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR A TRUST WORTHY FOREIGN PARTNER INTO WHOSE BANK ACCOUNT THIS FUND WOULD BE REMITTED. BASE ON THIS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MANDATED ME TO PROVIDE A FOREIGN PARTNER WHO WILL ASSIST US.
WE HAVE AGREED TO COMPENSATE YOU UPON THE COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION IF YOU SHOULD ACCEPT TO ASSIST US.

PLEASE REACH ME VIA THE ABOVE STATED DETAILS IF YOU ARE ABLE TO ASSIST US. WE ASSURE YOU THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE AS THE BENEFICIARY IS DEAD. TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HIM PLEASE ACCESS THE WEBSITE BELOW.
