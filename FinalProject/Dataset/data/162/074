How are you, 

Born in France in 1928, Raymond Federman emigrated to the US in 1947, 
following the deaths of his mother, father, and two sisters at Auschwitz.
His early experiences in the US included time as an American paratrooper 
in Korea, a saxaphone player in Detroit, and a dishwasher and student in
New York, before earning his PhD in Literature at UCLA in 1963 and becoming 
one of the first American critical promoters of the work of Samuel Beckett. 
Federman taught literature, creative writing, and French at SUNY at Buffalo 
from 1964-1998, before retiring as the Melodia E. Jones Chair of French. 
His numerous experiences and exploits have become the basis for over twenty 
books of fiction, poetry, and criticism, translated into German, Italian, 
French, Hungarian, Polish, Serbian, Rumanian, Hebrew, Dutch, Greek, Japanese, 
and Chinese. Federman is also the recipient of Guggenheim, Fulbright, National 
Endowment for the Arts, New York State Foundation for the Arts fellowships, as 
well as numerous foreign awards, and is considered an important theorist of 
contemporary fiction. He lives in San Diego, California, with his wife, Erica. 


Have a great day, it was good talking to you.
