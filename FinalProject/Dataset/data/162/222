From Mr.Smith A.Guei

Investment Proposal.
                         Dear Sir,
May I formally introduce myself to you before hand here. I am Mr. Smith A.Guei,
the only surviving son of Late Gen. Robert Guei, who was the former military
President of my country Cote D'Ivoire. My late Father was murdered on the
18-09-2002. My entire family was almost wiped out of this surface earth by
military coupe d'etat. As his survivors, we left immediately to a Neigbouring
Country republic of benin where we took decission to take Asylum. That is
myself and my kid sister Miss Candice Guei.

I confide in you to disclose my late fathers' wealth acquired while in office as
the former President of my country Cote D'lvoire. The sum of $45M.USD (forty
five million dollars only) Deposited as family personal effects into a security
company for safe-keepig by my late Father without making the real contents of
the consignment known that it contains Money.
Proceedures:
1. I will appreciate it if you can help me clear this Fund from the Security
Company in your Name as my Father's foriegn partner. I have already taken
refuge in Cotonou to avoid persecution back home and also our accounts both
foreign and local have been frozen and property confiscated by the present
government in Abidjan - Cote D'Ivoire. Also, on clearing these money if you can
help me secure visa/passport to enable me move away from here to anywhere you
think is safe, I'm ready to offer you 25% of the money. 2. I have already made
a contact with the security company Abroad, and they confirmed having such
deposit under their custody. Your duty is to assist in receiving the Money for
urgent
transfer into your account for future investment on my behalf pending my arrival
into your country for permanent resident.

3. You are required to send me the followings:
***** Your full Location address and private telephone and fax number in your
next reply.
With the above informations, I shall commence the procedures as my late father's
foreign partner for the claims, by sending you the proof Document concerning
this deposit.
I therefore advise you to treat this with utmost secrecy and urgency by reaching
me through my email address hence l am in refegue camp in cotonou, Republic of
Benin.
I am waiting for your urgent response so that I will give you more Details on
how to proceed
Every modality on how to invest this Fund must be undertaken by you, why
because, I don't have any knowledge about business, so I find it difficult to
handle such amount of money in any way.

The present government has no knowledge about this money, including this
country's government (Benin) where I have taken refuge
Yours' Sincerely,
Mr.Smith A. Guei Jnr.
