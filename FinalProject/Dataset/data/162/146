Jim Hamilton had a severe heart attack yesterday, Friday, Dec. 7, while @ home. Cathy took him to the West Houston Medical Center on Richmond, near Royal Oaks. He is in ICU. That is the hospital to which Tom Garcia, Jim's doctor, is admitted.

The extent of the heart damage is not known. He has severe blockage in 3 arteries. They are trying to stabilize him.

The family is doing as well as can be expected under the circumstances. 

I thought you guys would want to know.-L
