Louise,

I know you're swamped, so I am emailing this:

I'm happy to proceed as soon as appropriate, as we discussed, on the assumption that you will be successful in preserving my bonus for this year.

I'd like to rally the troops and get started on preparation for the next step, but before I can do much, we need to:

	- Make it official that I will be in charge.
	- Confirm or deny the following assumptions:
		- We will have a new name
		- We will want a slightly changed look for the new name, but still recognizeable as "the old 			EnronOnline"
		- The new name will in fact be a new entity (requiring assignment of old PA's or new PA's as 		appropriate).

I will keep a low profile until I hear from you.

Dave
