Jerry,

FYI, Jan and I may be late for this meeting since we are taking her to lunch to celebrate her 20 years of service.  If we miss this meeting, may we touch base with you by phone to get any pertinent info on TW.  Also, we want a recap on any stories or jokes that you tell!  :>).

Many thanks, 
Kim.
