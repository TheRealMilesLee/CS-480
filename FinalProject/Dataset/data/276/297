                        Quest Oil Corporation’s mission is to optimize the 
                        development of oil &amp; gas resources out of its petroleum 
                        licenses in order to create the greatest value for its 
                        shareholders. Quest Oil intends to accomplish this by 
                        managing the exploration process and only incorporating 
                        joint venture partners to execute our predetermined 
                        exploitation strategy. Quest Oil positions itself

                        the South Pacific and Africa Quest Oil is positioning 
                        itself as a quality Junior resource exploration company. 
                        As a US public company Quest has access to the financial

                      The Acadia Project is located in southeast Alberta near 
                      the Saskatchewan border.&nbsp; Acadia North consists of two 
                      sections totaling 1280 gross acres overlying the vast 
                      Viking gas target. The Arneson Viking Pool is a shoreface 
                      sand deposit and oriented in a NE-SW direction.&nbsp; The pool 
                      has been encountered by four previously drill wells since 
                      1972.&nbsp; The porous sand ranges from 30 feet to 46 feet 
                      thick and contains gas under lain by water.&nbsp; Pay zone 
                      thickness ranges from 4 feet to 12 feet with a proven and 
                      probable recoverable reserve of 8 BCF at a market value of 
                      $24 million.&nbsp; According to Chapman Engineering of Calgary,
