Phone number:+234-8030819087

I am Mr, RASA RASAKI, the Finance Manager to the Omegabank Nig 
Plc.Your contact was given to me by a very good/ school mate of mine,
that works with the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce here in Nigeria.

So i will be please to use this chance to intruduce to you a business 
transaction(deal). You are to  relax your mind, because this is REAL.

Being the manager in the bank(Omegabank) i have discover a very good deal
transaction which both of us will benefir from, provided i am 
concerned.

As its stands, there is a foreign client(customer) in person of MR. 
EDWARD PALMER, also a very good business man who has a very huge sum of
amount($18.580Million) in the bank(Omegabank)  before his suprise death. 

It was a pity and sorrowfull that Mr,PALMER, the wife and their only 
son died sorrowfully, which is, they were among the victims of the 
TERRORIST BOMB BLAST TRAGEDY, that occured recently(11th, 
september,2001) in United States of America(USA) during his visit for a
business negotiation in America.

As the forex manager in the bank also a very good family friend to 
Mr,PALMER, i have been able to try all my possible best to see(locate) 
if i can get or know any of this man (Mr, PALMER) family member or 
relation, so that i can get them informed of the latest development as
regards to the huge sum of amount which belongs to Mr, PALMER, in the 
Omegabank. 

To your best knowledge this sum($18.580Million) is floating in the 
Omegabank and i will not want it to finally taken by the management of
the Omegabank. But to my greatest suprise, it happens that Mr, PALMER,
did
not have anybody or other person left behind to stand as his NEXT OF KIN
to
this money ($18.580 Million).

Now, since this man has no any other person left behind for the claim 
of this very huge sum of money, as the NEXT OF KIN, i will want to 
realise with you as a foreign partner in respect of this  money, so 
that  this huge sum ($18.580 Million) could be paid (Remitted) to you
into
 your private bank account as the NEXT OF KIN to this our very good
customer/ client (Mr,PALMER).

For your information all the necessary arrangement has been put in 
place to ensure 100% success, while all the important document that
covers

this money are also at my hand reach, as i have told you initially that 
i am a family friend to this very man (Mr, PALMER).In NUT-SHELL i will 
want you to stand as the next of kin to Mr,PALMER, so that we can get 
this money out from the Omegabank Nig Plc, into your private bank 
account for safe-keeping pending my arrival for sharing in your 
country.

It is very important you indicate your williness, so that i can send 
across to you all the necessary TEXT FORM document from the bank also
talk on the issue of the sharing modalities as i have planned. Please
this deal is of REAL, SECRECY and 100%risk-free. Bear in mind that we 
are concluding this deal between 28 working days which is from the day 
of your positive response is being received. You are also required to 
send across your private  Telephone and fax number for easy 
communication  and oral discussion, so as to avoid any delay.

I come again, you are to stand as the next of kin(Relation) to this 
very man (Mr, PALMER) for the claim of this huge amount 
($18.580M).Finally, 30% for your assistance, 60% for me, 10% for the
re-settlement of any expenses incured from both side while 25% will be
invested in the name of your company and care.

Congratulations to you and your entire family.
