Hi, Andrea.

We can give the expanded access once the new NETCO version of the RMS database is up and running.

We are working on the new database as we speak.  Once it's up and running we will grant the access.

If you need anything else in the meantime please contact myself or Susan Trevino, thanks!

Andrew-

Under NETCO our group will be assuming responsibility for the Power side of RisktRAC.  Can you grant full RisktRAC access to the following people:

Stacey White	swhite
Casey Evans	cevans
Andrea Dahlke	adahlke
Donnie Vinson	dvinson
JP Lewis	jlewis9

Let me know if you need additional information to complete the request.

Thanks Andrew!
