Each year the WASHINGTON POST's Style Invitational asks readers
to take any word from the dictionary, alter it by adding,
subtracting, or changing one letter and supplying a new
definition. 

Here are the 2001 winners: 

Intaxication: Euphoria at getting a tax refund, which lasts
until
you realize it was your money to start with.
Reintarnation: Coming back to life as a hillbilly. 
Giraffiti: Vandalism spray-painted very, very high.
Sarchasm: The gulf between the author of sarcastic wit and the
person who doesn't get it. 
Inoculatte: To take coffee intravenously when you are running
late.
Hipatitis: Terminal coolness. 
Osteopornosis: A degenerate disease. (this one got extra credit)

Karmageddon: It's like, when everybody is sending off all these
really bad vibes, right? And then, like, the Earth explodes and
it's like, a serious bummer. 
Glibido: All talk and no action. 
Dopeler Effect: The tendency of stupid ideas to seem smarter
when
they come at you rapidly. 
And, the pick of the literature: 
Ignoranus: A person who's both stupid and an asshole.
