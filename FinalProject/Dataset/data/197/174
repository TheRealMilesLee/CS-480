Raj and Kristin:

Sorry for the delay in sending you the list.   Traveling between New York
and Houston sometimes takes away valuable working hours.   As discussed in
the meeting, the attached list is very preliminary and is an on-going
working document.  Forms A, B and C are provided to you to illustrate the
type of information we would like to capture upon detailed analysis of the
trading positions and the associated market values.  At this juncture,
please do not complete any of these forms until we have further
discussions.



Regards,
Cindy
