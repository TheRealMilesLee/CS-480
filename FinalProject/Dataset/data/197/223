Sally,

Fallon's goal is to try to get all ENA Estate and EGM Estate employees on the 4th floor.  They are asking us to squeeze into 45 desks (doesn't include offices and admin stations).  

Operations employees supporting EIM and EGM were already counted in EGM's and EIM's counts.

I'm trying to find out if the Estate employees under Bob Hall employees were counted in Don Miller's count.

Bottom line is, if Fallon really wants to get everyone on the 4th floor, he's going to have to wait until EOL moves to 6, or pay to shift EOL somewhere else in the meantime.

Al,

ENW would most likely fit in the spaces we discussed (141-198) barring any major shift in the number of employees classified as NetCo or Estate.  It will probably be at least 3-4 days before the number can be determined.  However, I've learned that EOL will not be moving to the 6th floor for at least 2 weeks due to a lack of space on the churn schedule.  

There are 32 EOL employees in the 301-346 range that would have to move temporarily to accomplish your goal. You should speak with Tammy Shepperd about this as she is coordinating the EOL move to the 6th floor.
