ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

Summary of January 13, 2002

===========================================

Dear Folks –

   There is no way I can give a summary of the two touching and
brilliant presentations that were given in the Ordinary Life Gathering
this past Sunday.

   SuZanne and Jennifer Feather gave their individual perspectives and
experiences on dealing with Jennifer's discovery and announcement of
being lesbian.

   Over 150 people attended the presentation.

   When SuZanne and Jennifer were finished they got a well-deserved
standing ovation.

   If you were present you saw examples of courage and love that moved
many to tears. Courage and love are, in my opinion, what the spiritual
journey is all about.

   Audio tapes of the presentation will be available this coming week.
If you live out of town, one can be sent to you. The best way to
expedite this, if you want a tape, would be to send a check to me for
$6.00 made payable to Ordinary Life Gathering. I'll make sure you get a
tape as soon as possible.

               * * *

   This Thursday evening at seven o'clock my beautiful bride, Dr.
Sherry Beeman, and I will be conducting a relationship seminar

       Don't Just Communicate,
   Really Connect With Your Partner."
