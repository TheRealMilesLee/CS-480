For your attention=3A
 
   My name is Mr=2E Anthony Chikane=2C I am an auditor in First National Bank of South Africa=2E I am contacting you of a business transfer=2C of a huge sum of money from a deceased=92s account=2E Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried=2C I am guarantying you that everything has been dilligently taken care off=2E 
I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction=2E To ease your apprehension=2C I got your contact from the British chambers of commerce and industry=2C foreign trade division=2E  An account was opened by a foreigner named Douglas Banks who died in an air crash along with his wife on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board=2E
 
 
Prior to the death of this gentleman=2C I worked in the personal banking service in our bank=2C and Mr Banks was one of my clients=2E He had made money from the illegal diamond trade in Angola=2E Due to the UN=92s involvement in tracking down illegal miners of diamonds=2C He and his wife=2C Estelle were the only ones who knew about the money=2C as they wanted to keep the volume of their wealth secret=2E We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines=2E That of course would not happen as there is no one listed as the next of kin in the documents=2E His only child=2C a daughter is married and lives in Sydney with her husband=2E The Douglas and his wife officially lived in Zurich=2C but Douglas most of his time here in Africa before his death=2E
With these details=2C I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased=2E Most of the documentation for the funds has been carefully worked out by a lawyer=2E The total amount of funds stand at Twenty seven million=2C six hundred and twenty three thousand United States dollars =28US$27=2C623=2C000=2E00=29=2C and would be paid into a domiciliary account to be released in your favour as the beneficiary's next of kin=2E 
 
In South Africa=2C after a time period of six years=2C funds such as these are usually recalled back by the bank treasury as unclaimed bills=2E It is on this note I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin=2Fbeneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to share this money amongst themselves at the end of the year=2E 

It is also worth pointing out to you that we have secured from the probate=2C a writ of mandamus to trace any of the deceased beneficiaries=2E Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by providing me with the following information if you are interested=2E 
 
=3F=09A Beneficiary name=3B=2E In order for me to prepare the documents for transfer of the funds in your name=2E It would also be imperative that you would be able to travel to South Africa to open a non-resident account for onward transfer to your overseas account=2C and for us to see face to face=2E 

=3F=09Direct Telephone and fax numbers=3B=2E For our personal contact and for the confidentiality of this transactions=2E 

I have decided to compensate you with 25% of the total sum on final conclusion of this venture for your aid=2E 5% of the funds will go to the lawyer who has helped with some of the documentation so far=2C and who will help us complete this deal=2E  I plan to use the balance 70% for investment purposes in your country as I cannot bring back such amount of cash to my country without raising eyebrows=2E I do hope you have suggestions on which ventures I can invest in=2E
 
If you choose to accept the terms of this offer=2C please try to contact me instantaneously=2E I hope you do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you by informing you of this transaction from my bank as I will advise you to kindly cease from responding at all if you do not intend to render any assistance=2E 

You can contact me via my confidential direct e-mail address which is tonychikane=40netscape=2Enet=2E 

Best regards=2C 
 
Mr=2E Anthony Chikane=2E
