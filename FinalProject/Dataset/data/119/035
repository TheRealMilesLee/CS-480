From: Roy Jones Esq. 
Roy Jones and Associates 

Dear Friend, 
Compliments, and do please accept my highest regards and Esteem. This 
proposal might come to you as a surprise due to the urgent need of a 
reliable foreigner, I therefore deem it necessary to contact you. I am 
Barrister Roy Jones, a solicitor at Law and the personal attorney to 
late Mr. John Ping a Thai Nationale Residing in Cardiff -Wales in the 
UK,hereinafter shall be refered to as my client. 
On the 22nd of Dec. 2004, my client, his wife and all their three 
children travelled to Thailand for the christmas holiday. 
Unfortunately, my client Mr. Ping and all his family died in the most 
terrible and highly horrible Indian Ocean's Tidal Wave disaster (Asian 
Tsunami) of the Dec. 26th 2004. 
Ever since this tragic and traumatic events, I have made frantic 
efforts to establish contacts with his relatives, but could not 
succeed. Due to the fact that considering the nature of my clients 
business dealings, He never presented any name on Documentation as his 
possible next of kin. I am therefore with all sense of humility decided to make contact with you in order to assit in claiming and retrieving the money left behind by my client before the credit house know of his 
demise and probably get the funds confiscated or even decleared it 
unserviceable by the finance and credit institution where these funds were deposited. 
I solicit your urgent assistance and co-operation as a foreigner for 
easy passage of the funds to your designated Bank account. 
Mr. Ping was a successful businessman and was involved in cash 
transactions due to the nature of his business. He was engaged in 
buying of Raw Gold and Diamond from His suppliers in the mineral - rich 
equatorial belt of central and southern African Countries, after which 
he sends the consignments to Bangkok in Thailand for processing and 
onward shipments to Dubia, Saudi Arabia and the UK. 
The amount of money kept in the custody of the finance and credit house 
is USD 25.5 million Dollars only. Since I have been unable to locate 
his relatives after all my frantic efforts, I am therefore compelled by 
this circumstances to seek your consent to present you sir, with my 
position as his legal advicer as his next of kin or business associate 
of the deceased so as to enable you receive and collect the above 
funds. 
All other further informations to that effect at my disposal will be 
made available to you upon your consent and the acceptance of the 
project. 
The funds when retrieved and successfully secured will be shared thus: 
- myself, the attorney 40%, yourself the presented next of kin 30%, 
while 20% will go to Charity and possibly the Tsunami victims through 
you, in line with my clients belief and support for Charity as a great 
philantropist during his life time, the balance of 10% will be for 
contingency expenses to be incured during the process by both parties. 
I assure you the fullest and absolute co-operation and a hitch free 
operation in this regards. I equally guarranttee you total protection 
against any breach of the law in line with my legal profession. 
You are indeed very free to ask questions you deem necessary for 
further clarifications, and please endeavour to always keep secret all 
informations concering this transaction. 
Your most urgent response will be highly appreciated through my email: 
roy_jones@mail2world.com, in order to avoid my making
further contacts.
 
Regards. 
Barrister Roy Jones
