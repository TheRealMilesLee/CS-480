Xtreme Companies Announces Sale of Fire-Rescue Jet Boat to Anglesea Fire Company No. 1<br>
Friday February 6, 4:15 pm ET <br>
<br>
<br>
STANTON, Calif., Feb. 6, 2004 (PRIMEZONE) -- Xtreme Companies, Inc. (OTC BB:XTME.OB - News) announced today that it sold a model FRJ-1250 Fire-Rescue Jet Boat to Anglesea Volunteer Fire Company No. 1 in North Wildwood, New Jersey. The expected delivery date is March 2004.<br>
<br>
Eric Shenkus, President, Anglesea Volunteer Fire Company No. 1 commented, ``Xtreme Companies' FRJ-1250 has proven its weight over the last couple of years in the neighboring town of Stone Harbor, NJ. The boat meets all of our needs especially in ocean rescue, around marina developments and has excellent fire fighting capabilities.''<br>
<br>
Xtreme CEO Kevin Ryan stated, "The FRJ-1250 continues to perform at high levels for past purchasers and that optimum performance was the basis for this opportunity with Anglesea Volunteer Fire Company No.1.'' He added, "In addition, since the sale and delivery of two FRJ-1250's to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in the last quarter of 2003, the response and number of inquires from other potential customers has been very encouraging.''<br>
<br>
The FRJ-1250 is ideal for shallow water rescues, pier fires, shore fires, or structure fires near the water. It is remarkably maneuverable, turning quickly in its own footprint, and it operates at higher speeds than other currently available fireboats. Its maneuverability and performance generates highly desirable rapid response time, and it can also be used to fill the water tanks of traditional fire trucks near a shoreline. The boat can hold up to five firefighters at a time. With its individually powered Hale pump capable of delivering approximately 750 gallons per minute, a distance of approximately 120 feet, it can accomplish extensive firefighting results in difficult surroundings, both ashore and with other watercraft. The boat is small enough that it can be moved easily on a trailer
behind an SUV. One firefighter can easily deploy, operate, and recover the boat. It can also be equipped with a specialized foam dispensing system for chemical fires.<br>
