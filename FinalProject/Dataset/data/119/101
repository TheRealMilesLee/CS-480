Harry, Iris and Brandon:

Just finished up another call with my counterparty at Dominion.  Here are the opportunities:

1.	GridSouth - (They really want to dump in "CP&L East" - anything we can do to facilitate 	this will better meet customer requirements.

		Capacity:	2003 - 100MW
				2004 - 250MW
				2005 - 570MW for five years

	Will accept day-ahead dispatch.  Really want 8 hour minimum runs w/ 5x16 availability.

		Heat Rate:	7200
		VOM		$2/MWh

2.	Entergy - 

		They want a straight 7x24, 365-day power purchase @ fixed price.

		Capacity:	65MW
		Start Date:	July 2002
		Term:		5 Years
		Price:		$x/MWh

3.	TVA - Peaker

		Really want intra-day call w/4hr notice for 4hr minimum run time.

		Capacity:	Tell me what, if any, we can do.
		Start Date:	June 2004
		Availability:	5x16 June-Aug; Dec-Mar
		Heat Rate:	10,900
		VOM:		$2/MWh

		Let's really try to see if we can do the intra-day.  If absolutely not available for 4hr 		min run time, see if we can do 8hr min.  If this is absolutely not possible, let's try 		to quote day-ahead 8hr min at the very least.

4.	TVA - Combined Cycle

		This one we already quoted at $3.97/KW-mo for 4-year, 5x16 call, beginning 		1/1/03 for 7,000 Heat Rate; $2 VOM.  This was for day-ahead, 16hr min run time.  		Tell me how much the price changes if we reduce min run time from 16hrs to 		8hrs.

Please call me in NY @ 212-715-5953 to discuss, if you have any questions.  Thanks for all your work.  I think we have a real opportunity here, if we can respond positively on a few fronts.

Regards, Greg
