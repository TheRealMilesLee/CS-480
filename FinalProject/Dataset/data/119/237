Jim:

The footnote disclosure regarding the credit faciltiy mentions the Citibank prepay and the split between NNG and TPC.  We will be trying to include the entire amount in the TPC facilty rather than split the amount.  In addition, the facility will be unwound at the corp level and dropped into TPC, therefore, I am not sure we need to even mention this in the footnotes.
