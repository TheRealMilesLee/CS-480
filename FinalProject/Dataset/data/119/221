Hi guys,

here is a simple template based on discussions with Vince and Rakesh.  It takes positions for a single commodity (physical and financial), collateral info, and calculates P&L and collateral needs over a one month horizon.

This can be expanded to add pictorial info, and other expenses, and any other details as needed.

This is just a first cut, please feel free to tear it apart as appropriate.

Vasant
