TRANSWESTERN TOUTS SUCCESS OF OPEN SEASON FOR SUN DEVIL PIPELINE

Enron Corp.'s subsidiary Transwestern Pipeline Co. says it received requests for more than 1.3 Bcf/d of capacity for its proposed Sun Devil Pipeline expansion project that would transport San Juan Basin natural gas production to market areas in Phoenix and California by January 2004. 
Transwestern's Sun Devil Pipeline was announced as another of several new western states' gas transportation options. A Transwestern official said the gas-fired electric generation market in Arizona is the second largest growth market in the U.S. The company is working with shippers to finalize transportation agreements and expects to file its Sun Devil application with the FERC early next year. Shippers needing additional information can contact Project Director Kevin Hyatt at 713-853-5559 or email at Kevin.hyatt@enron.com. 
Transwestern announced its plans on August 8. The proposed project will include new compression and pipeline looping plus a new lateral, the Flagstaff - Phoenix, Arizona lateral, which would add approximately 175 miles to Transwestern's existing system. The project's estimated in-service date is January 2004. The proposed facility modifications will enable Transwestern to deliver an incremental 780,000 dth/d from the Blanco Hub located in San Juan County, New Mexico to the Thoreau area, an incremental 90,000 dth/d from Thoreau to the California border, and an incremental 450,000 dth/d from Thoreau to Phoenix. Potential supply receipt points from the San Juan Basin at the Blanco Hub are BRT/Val Verde Plant, WFS/Milagro Plant, WFS/Kutz Plant, and TransColorado/Blanco. Transwestern will consider interconnecting with other upstream and downstream pipelines, subject to the mutual agreement of the pipelines. The estimated maximum one-part reservation rates, exclusive of fuel and all surcharges, for firm service through the capacity described in this open season are as follows: San Juan to Thoreau -$.0985 dth/d; Thoreau to California -- $.240 dth/d; and Thoreau to Phoenix -- $0.454 dth/d. (See REPORT NO. 2348, pp6-7.) 
Transwestern's Red Rock Project (CP01-115), approved by FERC earlier this summer and under construction, will add 150 MMcf/d of new capacity for deliveries to the California border in mid-2002.
