Michelle just called and said it wasn't okay; they can only have alternate's inside the path at Max Rate.  She thinks they're going to re-send...

Craig,

Sempra discussed this with Michelle Lokay and she indicated that it was OK. We will initial the revised contract and deliver to you today.

Thanks,

Paul

Sempra sent back K# 27342 (30,000/d Ignacio to Blanco) and had added a footnote about alternate points at Max Rate inside and outside the path (which I forwarded to you).  This has not been activated as I'm waiting for you to approve/disapprove their change.

Craig
