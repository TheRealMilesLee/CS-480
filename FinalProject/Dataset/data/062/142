Kim Ward is following up to see what happened.  Please use her more regularly to address "issues" that come up.  She is your point person on the gas desk.  For example, she is not copied on your nom e-mail and that should be changed.

Craig,
 
In the month of August, EPME nominated the requested volumes to 9JZ2 (Citizen's San Juan Pool Contract).  The nomination was not confirmed by your operations group, thus the nominated volume was reduced to zero.  To answer your question, I recommend confirming the gas EPME nominates.  If you have any questions about the nominating procedure, please contact Jason Kelm (713-420-6038).  In regards the month of September, the first day the gas was confirmed was 9-8-01.  So far, 10,313 mmbtus have been delivered.

I sent the message below at the end of August and the one below that at the end of July.  

The only problem is that NO gas was scheduled during August and I can't find any gas for September!  Now the imbalance has grown larger instead of smaller!!  

I also need gas for October.  What do I need to do to get this scheduled and confirmed for October?
