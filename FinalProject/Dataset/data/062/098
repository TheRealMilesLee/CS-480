Please can you assist or rather team up with me to claim my
client's deposit in his bank.
The amount is the sum of $8.9Million (Eight Million, Nine
Hundred Thousand U S Dollars)

He died with his wife and their two Children in the Air
France concord plane crash bound for New York in their plan
for a world cruise. You can view the International news
headline as the news of the accident appeard in the
electronic media,
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm Although
I know that a transaction of this magnitude might make
anyone apprehensive,I would like to assure you that I am
sending you this mail with the best of intensions as A
practicing lawyer in Nigeria.

I have tried to hold on for any possible imformation of a
living relation but could not see till now and the bank
will confisticate the fund for their uses as terming it as
dormant account any moment from now, which I can not afford
to let happen.

You can call me on my private telephone number:234
8033082448, for us to discuss further or write me back only
via Email: "frankprivate@safe-mail.net"


I will waite to recieve your response so that I can discuss
the full details and modalities with you.

Thanks
