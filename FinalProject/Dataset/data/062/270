Elliot wants to have another conference call to discuss this weeks events. It seems that we've made some progress on several projects in the last few days. A suggestion was made that we schedule something around 1 PM pst tomorrow. That's 3pm on a Friday for you Houstonians…  Let me know if this doesn't work for anyone. Assuming there are no conflicts, I'll send a call-in number either this afternoon or early tomorrow.
Cheers,
Jesse
