I wish I could spend every day and every night with you.  You know I love you very much and I will try to be with you as much as I can.  I can't wait to see you.  Let me know what time I should meet you downstairs.

Love, Tracy

Thanks. That's nice to know. I miss you and love you so much. I think I have been having such a rough time lately beacause I just need to spend some quality time with you. I am really looking forward to this weekend and to all the other things we have been planning on doing. I enjoy the times we spend together. 
	Love Always,

		Steve
