Geoff,
 
I just wanted to confirm the deal we did.  I bought 9 GJ of z1x4 Enbridge Consumers CDA from you at +0.26 US/MMBtu.  I bought from Dutch on behalf of yourself 3.145 for the same term, same volume of Nymex (he may have entered it as a mmbtu number).  Your counterparty is Carlos Torres (FT-CAND_EGSC).   He knows buying 9 GJs of z1x4 Enbridge Consumers CDA at $3.405 US/MMBtu.  Sorry for the piddly volume.
 
Steve
