<P>Dear Mr./Mrs. </P>
<P>We are writing you on behalf of ULTRACO S.A., well-known prestigious Swiss 
company which main field of operation lies in selling elite watches collections 
and jewelry series. We are glad to propose you interesting and highly paid job 
in financial sphere. At this moment we are in need of new regional financial 
agents whose work consists of collecting the payments from the customers from 
the same country and forwarding them to our companys main office. Due to our 
operating employees inability to handle the sales volume we decided to open 
additional vacancies in each European country as well as in the USA, Canada, 
Australia and New Zealand. <BR>Regional financial managers are needed because we 
accept bank wire transfers only and as you know international wire transfer 
could take more than 3 or even 5 days, thus increasing term of delivery up to 
5-8 days. Such long term of delivery adversely affects our sales volume that's 
why we provide our agent's account details to the customer who is in the same 
country. Bank transfer within the same country takes 1-2 days only. After we 
receive confirmation that the amount has been received we send purchased items 
to the customer immediately. These actions let us to diminish term of delivery 
to 3-4 days. <BR>Please visit our webpage at <A 
href="http://www.ultra-co.com/vacancies.html">www.ultra-co.com/vacancies.html</A> 
to get to know our proposal in greater detail and if you are interested please 
send an email to <A href="mailto:vacancy@ultra-co.com">vacancy@ultra-co.com</A> 
and we will send you an Application Form back. If you have any questions don't 
hesitate to contact us at <A 
href="mailto:info@ultra-co.com">info@ultra-co.com</A> and we will reply you for 
sure. Thanks for reading our proposal. </P>
<P>Chief Executive Officer, <BR>Jose Ansari, <BR>ULTRACO S.A.</P>
