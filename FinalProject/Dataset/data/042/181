                Corporation specializes in converting hotels into Condotels, a

                suites to individual purchasers, who usually are families 
                interested in a vacation rental, or purchasing a timeshare. The 
                owner has complete discretion over the time they will occupy 
                their Condo, and will receive some income from having it rented 
                out to others during periods when they are not using it.<br>

                Condotels are attractive for tourist accommodation, as an 
                alternative to regular hotels. They offer the luxury and 
                amenities of a luxury hotel, at an affordable price. Rooms are 
                rented weekly, and services are geared toward families on 
                vacation.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Condotel features include:<br>
                </b>- Rooms are privately owned, and may be rented out to 
                vacationers when the owner is not in residence<br>
                <br>
                - It provides owners with the opportunity to acquire rental 
                income plus own a vacation condo<br>
                <br>
                - A concierge is on-duty during the day and evening<br>
                <br>
                - Maid service is offered weekly<br>
                <br>
                - Hotel facilities, such as pools, fitness centres, tennis 
                courts, continue to be operated by the hotel and available for 
                the guests<br>
                <br>
                - On site restaurants and lounges are leased to private

                <br>
                Prior to purchasing a hotel, Fortune Real Estate Development 
                will assess the suitability of the hotel for conversion to a 
                condo hotel. It must be a luxury hotel, located in a tourist 
                destination area, with the potential to be successfully 
                developed into condominiums. The hotel operating costs must have 
                the capacity to be significantly reduced, while still ensuring 
                that the guest amenities and facilities will operate at a 
                quality level.<br>

                <font face="arial" size="2">Delroy Cowan is the CEO and major 
                shareholder of Fortune Real Estate Development Corporation (FRDJ.PK) 
                a publicly traded company, headquartered in Miami, Florida. A 
                dynamic leader and with acute business skills, he has a proven 
                track record of business and real estate development. Born and 
                raised in Jamaica Mr Cowan received his education and began his 
                early career in business there, with one small retail tire store 
                known as Tire King, which has successfully grown to become one 
                of the largest chains of tire stores on the island.<br>
                <br>
                While in Jamaica Mr. Cowan focused heavily on real estate 
                development, by building and refurbishing both residential and 
                commercial properties and then reselling them. He successfully 
                completed several major developments including residential 
                condominiums and one of the largest Amusement Parks in the 
                Caribbean. <br>
                <br>
                When he came to Florida in 1987, he continued in real estate 
                development, buying and refurbishing apartment buildings. He 
                soon had a thousand units rented, and then diversified into 
                commercial property ownership. It was during this time that he 
                again diversified and owned a variety of companies including a 
                television network (the Caribbean Satellite Network) and a used 
                car dealership in Miami. Continually analyzing and evaluating, 
                Mr. Cowan realized that he much preferred real estate 
                development, rather than the day-to-day demands of operating 
                small businesses, so he sold most of his companies, retaining 
                interest in the car dealership and Tire King. He continued to 
                study the market, and saw a niche in the hotel industry, which 
                has the potential for a great deal of profit. <br>
                <br>
                He is now specializing in acquiring hotels and apartment 
                buildings and redeveloping them as condo hotels and residential 
                condos. The Dorsan Suites is the initial project of Fortune Real 
                Estate Development Corporation. Mr. Cowan is very dedicated to 
                the success of his businesses typically working a twelve hour 
                day. He has assembled a strong and effective team, who has the 
                skills to ensure that the project meets its goals and targets. 
                In order to be successful, however, Mr. Cowan acknowledges the 
                importance of taking a step back to relax and recharge. He 
                reserves Saturday evenings and Sundays for his family, and may 
                also use this time to ride his motorcycle or pilot his 
                ultra-light. A quick escape before returning to his fast-paced 
                work life. </font><font face="arial" color="#676686" size="2">

                    profile published by OTC Live, Inc is an independent
                    electronic publication providing information and factual
                    analysis on selected companies. All statements and
                    expressions are the opinion of OTC Live, Inc and are not
                    meant to be either investment advice or a solicitation or
                    recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. Investing
                    in micro-cap securities is highly speculative and carries an
                    extremely high degree of risk. OTC Live, Inc is not a
                    registered investment advisor or a broker dealer. It is
                    possible that an investor's investment may be lost or
                    impaired due to the speculative nature of the companies
                    profiled. Profiles rely on information provided by the
                    featured Companies and/or Edgar filings. While OTC Live, Inc
                    believes its sources to be reliable, associates of OTC Live,

                    Readers should not rely solely on the information contained
                    in this publication, but should consult with their own

                    respect to any investment opportunity, including any
                    contemplated investment in the advertised Company. </span>

                    of this publication shall not create, under any 
                    circumstances, any implication that there has been no change

                    profit in the event the shares of the Company profiled by us
                    increase in value. These positions may be liquidated from
                    time to time even after we have made positive comments
                    regarding the Company.  The receipt of this information

                    FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: Except for historical
                    information contained herein, the statements on this website
                    and newsletter are forward-looking statements that are made
                    pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private
                    Securities Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements
                    involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may
                    cause a company's actual results in the future periods to
                    differ materially from forecasted results. These risks and
                    uncertainties include, among other things, product price
                    volatility, product demand, market competition and risk
                    inherent in the companies operations. You can identify these
                    statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to
                    historical or current facts. They use words such as
                    ``anticipate,'' ``estimate,'' ``expect,'' ``project,''

                    "suggest", ``believe,'' and other words and terms
                    of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of
                    future operating or financial performance.</span><font face="Arial"><o:p>

                    solely on what you read in an online newsletter or Internet
                    bulletin board, especially if the investment involves a
