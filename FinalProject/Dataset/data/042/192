Dear Friend, 

Firstly, I wish you the very best wishes of good health and Success. I also enjoin you not to wonder as this letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met. I have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any worries as I decided to contact you through this medium. As you read this, I don't want you to feel SORRY or PITY for me because I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Mr Larry Moore, a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with prostate and esophageal Cancer that was discovered lately due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all forms of medicine and right now, I have only about few months to live according to medical experts. 

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business. I wasn't too generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my businesses as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to live in this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. 

However, now that I know my time is near, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations and people, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth.I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to some orphanages as well as some Schools in the U.A.E. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself any more. The last of my money, which I planned to use in openning a shopping complex in London is a huge cash deposited with a Financial Security Firm abroad, I want to donate it to any worthy, charity organisation, hence my contacting you with blind trust having been led by my intuition of goodwill.

MY REQUEST 

As a result of my present health situation, I am looking for a trustworthy individual/firm to help me collect this deposited funds with the Financial Firm abroad and dispatch it to charity organizations and let them know that I, Mr Larry Moore, is making this generous donation as a dying man's last wish. I am writing this from my laptop computer in my hospital bed where I wait for my time to come. I pray that God uses you to support and assist me with good heart. 

COMMISSION/REMUNERATION 

As regards your commission/remuneration, I have decided to offer you 25% of the total sum and also set aside 5% for all your expenses (i.e for any expenses that will be incure during the process of this project).I strongly believe that associating with you to embark on this, will derive a huge success hereafter and it will mark a lasting bond for you and profound joy for me. If you are willing to assist me I will be expecting your response. Please write me through  my private e-mail account: mrlarrymoore@mail2uae.com  

  
I await your anticipated co-operation. 

Sincerely, 
Mr Larry Moore. 

NB: I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter until the task is accomplished because I do not want anything that will Jeopadize my last wish, as I do not want my family people to know about this because I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and donate the money, which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. I will be communicating with you by email as I do not want anybody(my medical staff) to know what I am up to as they are always around me.
