My business partners and I are looking for 4-5 highly motivated individuals that want to make 6 figure incomes in the next 12-18 months via a legitimate marketing venture.  To qualify, you must be from the United States, New Zealand, Canada, or Australia. <br>
<br>
Our team is in the Multi Level Marketing industry and we are in the top1% of all earners in the United States.  This is not just words but fact and if you contact us via our online form you will see we have doctors, lawyers, and other professionals on our team that will be working with you if you qualify.<br>

<br>
If you qualify, you will have people directly under you immediately to mentor as we have positions available now to fill for mentors.<br>
<br>
How have we done this?<br>
<br>
Since 1998, we have developed a complete system that is online that takes most of the hard work out of developing an online business in the MLM industry. One of my partners dropped out of MIT and the other is a graduate of Stanford whom developed this system. You no longer have to rely on just your friends and family to develop this business.  We have more people wanting into our company than we can currently handle and need talented individuals to help us.  In the past 3 months we have had over 2000 new members join and this is overwhelming our team.<br>
<br>
We currently have a ground floor opportunity that just launched in December, 2004 that is growing faster than anything in the past with a functional health beverage.  We currently are developing this in the USA, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.  <br>
<br>
We are currently seeking 4-5 entrepreneurs that want to make 6 figure incomes in the next 12-18 months that we can personally mentor.  Since our time is limited, we do not have time to work with everyone.  Thus, if you feel you have the talent to market online, please complete our online appointment form and one of my partners or I will call and interview you to discuss this business opportunity and see if you are the right fit for our team.  You do not have to be a computer programmer but must be a self motivated individual that has ability to communicate with others effectively and willing to devote 1-3 hours daily to this venture.<br>

<br>
