Shelley,

I'm working with Kevin Howard on the Revolver and I'm looking at the 2002 Transwestern Operating Plan.
I'm trying to isolated the "cash items" in Operating Expenses.
Undering Operating Expenses, there is a line item called "Fuel Used in Operations" that is credited against operating expenses.  Is that amount collected in cash on a monthy basis or is it accrued?

Thanks,
Travis Winfrey
