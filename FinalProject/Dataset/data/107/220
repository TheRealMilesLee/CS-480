Kim and Mark,

The attached is a list that Janna Blanter at Duke sent which details the transactions that they believe are between Duke Energy Marketing Limited Partnership and ENA which need to be moved to the ECC ISDA. From our records, I do not think this matches, but we need to reconcile.  Kim, if you could try to match these up and pull the confirms to determine which legal entity we used. Anything that is ENA we will need to assign to ECC. Please advise.

Thanks,
Tanya

This is a follow up to my conversation with Tanya in reference to
transactions between DEM LP and Enron North America to be assigned to Enron
Canada Corp.  I failed to get Tanya's e-mail address (or correct spelling
of her name so if it is misspelled please forgive me) and I ask you to
forward this to her.  Attached is the spreadsheet list of the transactions
to be assigned.  Furthermore, she asked for our legal counsel's name to
discuss the collateral agreement issues and that would be Joe Forbes at
(713) 627-6124.  Your help is greatly appreciated.
