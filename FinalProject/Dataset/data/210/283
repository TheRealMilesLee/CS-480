ATTN: Dearly Beloved,
This communication to you is strictly
confidential, with due respect. Sorry at this perceived confusion or 
stress you may have receiving this letter from me, Since we have not 
known ourselves or met previously. 

Despite that, I am constrained to write you this letter because of the 
urgency of it.By way of  self introduction, I am Mrs. Mary Kobe, the wife
 of late Brigadier - Gen.Maxwell Kobe former ECOMOG ARMY COMMANDER
 [West African peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone] who died in the Sierra 
Leone civil disturbance [War]. My three daughters and I are trapped in o
bnoxious custom and traditional norms. 

We have suffered maltreatment and untold hardship in the hands of my late 
husband's family, simply because I did not bear a male child [heir apparent]
 for my late husband. By tradition, all that my late husband had! , [wealth] 
belongs to his brothers/family. And myself is to be remarried by his immediate 
younger brother which I vehemently refused. They have taken  all that I
 suffered with my husband to acquire including treasures, houses  and 
his bank particular seized by them. I wanted to escape to the United  State 
of America [USA} with my children on exile, but again they conspired and 
stole my international passport and other traveling document to further frustrate me. 

Thank God, two weeks ago, I received Key Text Code [KTC} from a security & 
Finance Company abroad, that my late husband maintains a saftey eposit 
box of high value with this company and i am the next of kin sotherefore i 
should make necessary arrangements to come for the claim of the box .

It has therefore, become very necessary and urgent to contact someone, 
a foreigner like you to help me receive/secure the consignment while we i 
and my children find a way o! f getting out to meet with you in your country. 

The consignment was kept on an "OPEN BENEFICIARY MANDATE" with 
the Security Company to avoid detection, seizure or diversion. 

I have had several telephone discussions with the Assistant Director of the 
security company, who has expressed willingness to help me on meeting  
the company's demands. This is why I have contacted you to help save my 
children and I, receive/secure the safety box on our behalf. 
But, you would need to give me sufficient assurance that if you help me, you 
would not divert its contents which i will reveal to you as this is an information 
known only to me and no one else.

My children and I have resolved to give you a certain percentage for your 
honest assistance to us and i shall open up to you as i have to be careful 
for this is the only way i and my children stand to live better lives.

This is all my children and I have got to live on. 
Please! , I have reposed my confidence in you and hope you will not
disappoint me. I look forward to your urgent response, including your
private phone / mobile No and also your fax no for easier communication. 
NB: The secret codes (e.g Pin No., Secret Access Code) for the box are
safely kept with me which I will give you as soon as you express desire 
to help me. 
Stay blessed. 
MRS. JOY KOBE.
