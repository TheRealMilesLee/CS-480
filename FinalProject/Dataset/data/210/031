Fyi: The PA and ETA have been with Jim Petrie of UBS legal for several days, but we still do not have UBS legal approval. I have been hassling Mark Taylor, who has in turn been hassling Jim.

As a result, I am anticipating we cannot begin marketing to our Top 50 customers on Monday. The Splash page will be ready with full functionality Monday night, so I am hoping we get approval on Monday for a Tuesday Top 50 marketing launch.
