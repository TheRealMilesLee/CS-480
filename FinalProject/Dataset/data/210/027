York International will be in Monday Jan. 29 to begin preping the refrigerant compressor for transport.
There plan is to load the compressor on truck Monday the 4th of Feb. Yorks estimate for repair/test and 
back to us at 6 to 8 weeks. So we don't look for the compressor to be back till the 1st  week of April as long
as everything goes according to plans.
