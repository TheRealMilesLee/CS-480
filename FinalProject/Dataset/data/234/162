Scott Long, our former resident in the cute corner cottage at Morgan and
Bomar, did a lot of work on this issue.  He made photographs of standing
water (some of which came up on his lawn to the porch!), and he went to
the CIP hearings with Amy and me and made the presentation.  Let's ask
him if he possibly kept any of that material or if he recalls to whom he
gave it.

This is also one of the reasons that a prospective buyer (who wanted to
build a single family house there) backed out of buying the vacant lot
across Morgan from him.

The City has a file on this, and the former Council Member for District
D did also.

I think Ada Edwards may want to take this on.  Let's ask Annise for her
advice in how to proceed.

Annise?
