In a section of the will written on March 5, 1982, nearly a year after the
assassination bid, he makes a reference to his "place of funeral." 

Al-Jaafari's rise to the prime minister's job solidifies the rise to power

I know it's bad form to address you by your Christian name when we've never
formally met. But "Mrs. Parker Bowles" seems so formal. After all, I've read

that I feel I know you. At least well enough for a little woman-to-woman
chat.
