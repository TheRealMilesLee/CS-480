Hey,
 
Does your email still work.  I was wondering if you had a private email that would be appropriate for non business related correspondence??
 
Just curious.  Still would like to find a way to keep in touch better, the messenger thing is ok, but its hard at times with work and all.  At least with email we can say alittle more and at least have some uninterrupted time to "talk".
 
Speaking of talking….is there any time that is good to call?  I would like to hear your voice once in a while! J
 
Steve
