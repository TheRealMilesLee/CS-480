I consider myself pretty fortunate...I start my new
job at Duke Energy tomorrow morning.  I'll be working
on the Hourly Power Trading desk, and will hopefully
have a chance to move into a day-time trading,
structuring, or origination role 6 months from now. 
We'll see?

Anyway, I'll keep in touch.  And this email will be
the best place to reach me.

Thanks again.  And I hope that Enron's trading JV gets
formed soon.

Later,
Reagan
