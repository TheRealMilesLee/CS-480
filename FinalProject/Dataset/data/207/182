Snow in Hawaii!

Snow on Mauna Kea - January 23, 2002

Photos by Steven Parente

Throughout last weekend, the Big Island was deluged with heavy rains, high
surf and cool temperatures... reaching the low 60's in Hilo. Brrrrrrr. 

This late winter storm also brought heavy snowfall for Mauna Kea. Mauna Kea
translates into white mountain, and as you view the shots you'll understand
why.  From the ocean floor this is the tallest mountain in the world. 
There was a break today, so I braved the cool Hilo morning temperatures
(low 60's), went to Lili'uokalani Gardens, and took some shots of the
beautiful view of Mauna Kea. Hope you enjoy! - Steve 

Take a look!

We have some great new selections of potted orchids to look at as well. 
Like the Chieftain" Wild Warrior Orchid plant Winner of the American Orchid
Society's Award of Merit, this impressive plant with a mild fragrance
similar to the stephanotis flower is NOW AVAILABLE!

The "Chieftain" Wild Warrior Orchid plant is a Brassia/Oncidium mix
(P.O.I.-85 Brscdm). Each plant arrives in a 4" pot and wicker basket. Its
3-inch blooms have a white center and yellow-green petals that are long &
narrow with brown spots.
