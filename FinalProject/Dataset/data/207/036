Patrice,

Lisa Kinsey mentioned you may have information on the cancellation of ENA's transportation contracts on Midwestern.  Midwestern has an expiration date of 12/31/01 for the two contracts on the Dec. invoice (contract 30349 & 31468).  Do you agree with that end date or should they have an end date of 11/30/01?  Any information you could provide would be of great help.

Thanks,
Lee Ann Chance

Patrice Thurston was part of the process of negotiating this.  I believe that Coral is the one who took over the contract.  So you may get with Patrice to find out the particulars.

Lisa,

Thanks for the information.  We did receive an invoice for Dec production on contract 30349 and 31468.  I called my contact at MGT and their system shows an expiration date for these contracts of 12/31/2001.  Do you have any further information or documentation that could help me out?

Thanks,
Lee Ann

Lee Ann,
Enron had gotten out of the contract on Midwestern effective 11/30/01.  There should be no business on Midwestern for December 01.

Lisa,

I have some scheduling issues on Midwestern Gas Transmission for 12/01 production.  Could you direct me to who can help me with this?
