Dear icruise member,
Although we have had some snow in New York, everyone's mood at I-Cruise is sunny. January blues? Not with these amazin' deals!
If you can't find a room on Burbon Street for Mardi Gras then here's your chance to sail on the Rhaspsody of the Seas on 2/9/02.. You'll get two full days of fun in New Orleans over Mardi Gras for only $629 including port-limited space so book right now.
To me, there's nothing better then planning your summer vacation now and having some time to look forward to it. Celebrity's beautiful Constellation has a great itinerary in August for 13 fantastic days in Europe.. For only $1699 including port, it's a real deal on a brand new ship.
And, the Carnival Spirit has an incredible price for a 7 day Southbound Alaska trip.. $833 including port is outrageous.
I knew these rates would chase your blues away!
