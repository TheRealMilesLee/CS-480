There are plenty of good reasons to e-file: avoid mail delays, eliminate IRS errors, and get your refund faster. Now there's another great reason - you can e-file your federal return for FREE! When you use H&R Block's do-it-yourself online tax program, you can e-file to the IRS for no additional charge.

As an added feature for returning users, we've provided your username from last year so that you can import information from last year's return. Here's how it works. When you are ready to begin, simply enter your password from last year (if you've forgotten it, use the "password hint" at login*) and follow the instructions within the program to access your data.

Need reassurance this year? You can even have your completed return reviewed by an H&R Block tax professional before submitting to the IRS.

Do your taxes online with H&R Block. It's the fast, easy way to file.

* You will need to have both your username and password from last year to use this feature. To protect the security of your data, we cannot access your private password. If you have forgotten your password, we will provide your password hint. However, if that does not remind you, your information from last year cannot be accessed and imported. You will then need to create a new account and start a new return for this tax year.
