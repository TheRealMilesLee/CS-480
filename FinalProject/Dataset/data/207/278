There is clearly an issue here - we have been asking for this for weeks now.

Please, keep in mind, that the members of the Research Group
who stayed behind to facilitate the transition will be leaving

Does the state have copies of all programs?  Should systems manage the migration?  Muller was going to send vince the copy of the contract indicating the section to vince that required the turnover just to make sure we were doing the right thing - did that happen?
