After the Day ahead market ran, the PDCI (TNOB) branch group TTC in the
(S-N) direction was changed from 1904 MW to 1873 MW for HE's 0100 through
1200 for operating day 8/1/01.  The reason for the change is for work on the
Valve Group 6 at Sylmar.  The first applicable Hour Ahead market to run with
these values is HE 0600.  The ISO will update you of any changes in line
rating status.  Sent by Market Operations, inquiries please call the Hour
Ahead Desk.

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change.  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current,
accurate information available in preparing this notice, system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice.
