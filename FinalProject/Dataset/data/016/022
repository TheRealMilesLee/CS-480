We are experiencing technical difficulties with remote access to the SI
server, foliapp29f. As a result,  SC's are not able to view statements
generated on Friday, July 27, 2001 (Preliminary 6/4 and Final 5/15). We are
working to rectify this problem and will notify you as soon as the problem
is corrected.
