Attached is the table you requested listing the states and the 
baseline cutoff years according to the SIPs.  Anything that comes 
on-line in the years following the listed year is considered a new 
source and would not be included in the excel sheet that we 
provided.

Please do not hesitate to call us with questions.

Thanks, 
Sara

Also- Michael, for a discussion (with maps and listings) of fine 
grid/course grid you can look on the website.  After logging on 
choose SIP call/Section 126 from the left frame, click on 
"understanding the SIP Call" and choose the last link listed, "EPA 
Modified SIP in Response to Court Ruling (Jan. 2001)"  Give me a 
call if you have any problems.
