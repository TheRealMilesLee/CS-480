Gerald,
Thanks for your input.  We've added a few additional items (highlighted in blue) in the attached Term Sheet (please review).  The LD language is taken primarily from NNG's published FERC gas tariff.  Is this LD language consisent with ENA's Master Firm Agreement?

 

Please advise.

Thanks, Lisa Druzbik
