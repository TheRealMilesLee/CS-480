I have attached below a copy of the new Notice and Agenda for the ServiceCo Board meeting to be held tomorrow (Friday) at noon Houston time. The Notice contains the new call-in number for the meeting, which is as follows:

	Call toll-free 1-888-566-5914, and mention the passcode "ServiceCo".  If asked, the arranger for
	the call was David Roland.

I also faxed the Notice and Agenda to Shael and Tracy ( I attempted to fax to Brad but was not successful).

Thanks,
David
