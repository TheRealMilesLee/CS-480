I write to inform you of my good intention to set up investment

State Dollars. I am now soliciting your co-operation towards achieving this goal.
My areas of interest are in landed properties and Company formation. 
For your co-operation, I am ready to compensation you adequately.
If you are dispose and capable of assisting me, kindly reach me without delay for
details on this project.
SOURCE OF FUNDING
In 1999, late Gen Sanni Abacha former military ruler of Nigeria deposited the total sum of $15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million United State Dollars) in an INVESTMENT ACCOUNT with my Commission (Security and Stock Exchange Commission of Nigeria) in a ficticious name of a foreigner with the view to transferring the fund into his numerous bank account in oversea, however, he died before he could accomplished this mission. After his dealt, the democratic government that followed his regime constificated all his local and foreign bank accounts but this one with my Commision was left untouched due to the fast that the deposit was made in a ficticious name and nobody had the knowledge that it was deposited by the late dictator except my very self.
Since his death, I have managed the account with keen interest with the hope of transfering the fund abroad before my retirement from service. Last week, my name was shortlisted among the Directors that will be retiring before the end of this year. Base on this report, I decided to look for a reliable foreign partner who will co-operate with me to receive the fund in his bank account as the Next of Kin to the account owner since the deposit was made in the name of a foreigner and after that, I shall compensate him for his effort while I use my share of the fund to set up an investment for myself. 
Right now, I have worked out all modality for a successful transfer of the fund but I need a foreign partner to receive the fund in his bank account and this is why I am now contact you for your co-operation. 
Please if you are dispose and capable of any assistance,  reach me without delay on my most confidential email address: mmfalade@nyc.com for details on this subject matter.
Have my kind regards.
Mr Matthew Falade
