Lloyd,  thanks for the quick response.  Basically, Im trying to obtain a list of all common data (files, spreadsheets, etc.....) on the O:\ drive that will need to be migrated to NEWCO. I mainly need the directory path information,  O:\directoryname\directoryname.... I appreciate all the assistance.

Thanks,
Mike

I have passed your names on to Mike as key contacts for front line fundamental systems, he will likely be calling you on the request below.

He will work with Steve Nat, Theresa and Stacey on deal related systems independently of our needs.

Thanks.

To all,  The Enron Net Works infrastructure team is gathering requirements for all common data needed for NEWCO.  This includes Gas/Power commercial data and related trading support data. 
Based on the amount of data it can take significant time to migrate so we are on an aggressive schedule.  We need assistance from key individuals within each related business unit.  Please respond with a list of individuals that may be able to assist.  This will be a short effort with the right representation.  Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

Mike Croucher
