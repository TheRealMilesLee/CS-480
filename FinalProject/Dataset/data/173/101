Dave,
Guess I had some misinformation on the type.  Per Yvette, the platelets or cells in Darren Farmer's blood were the match and the blood type was secondary.  I'm not sure how it works, but Darren is definitely the guy.  I have a call in to Lisa to clarify this.

funny ... when I talked to Daren, he said he was A+.  Could it be Daron Giron?

Hi Dave,

Thanks for offering to talk to Darren about Lisa & Christopher.  Lisa can be reached at home at 281-296-0788 or cell 713-443-4523.  I'm sure she can fill in the details on how to have the blood credited to her account.

Anyone else you know of who has B- blood and would like to give would be MUCH appreciated!

Kris
