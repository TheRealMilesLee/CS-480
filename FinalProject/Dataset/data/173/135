Is there any way to indicate the amount they exceeded 1,900 on an hourly basis for the days indicated "YES"?

Tim and Gary,  Please review the attached spreadsheet for the hourly rates over the contractual limits.  If you have any questions give myself or Dale a call.  Thanks to Dale for the info.  j.  floyd

Jodie,

Jodie,

The attached file contains the LS Power Whitewater's hourly rate from 12/20/01 to 6/17/01.  If you need data prior to 6/17/01 we will have retrieve it from microfiche.  The file has a column for the scan hour, hourly rate, and a YES if the hour exceeded 1900.0 mcf per hour.  If you have any questions call me at x31534
