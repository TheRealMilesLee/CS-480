Version 2 - with Kal's input as well:

EnronOnline is currently not available.		

Enron is working to sell its trading and E-Commerce expertise to a strong, highly rated company by January 10. Shortly after deal closure, the new company is expected to launch a new, dedicated website for North American Gas and Power.

We will provide more information on this site as it becomes available. Please check back for future updates.

OK - here's the sort of thing I am thinking of (still needs Kal's magic).

I suspect you were thinking of a pop-up notice. Given that we aren't really showing anything on EnronOnline at the moment, I suggest we take down EnronOnline entirely and replace it with a splash page which says something like the following:


					COMING SOON

Enron is working with potential industry partners to assemble a new venture which will combine Enron's trading and market - making expertise with the financial strength and reliability of an A rated entity.

Upon formation of this new company, we anticipate that we will be able to announce the launch of a new trading platform for North American gas and power, providing services similar to those previously available on EnronOnline.

Please check back with this site for future updates on plans for the new trading platform.




What do you think?
