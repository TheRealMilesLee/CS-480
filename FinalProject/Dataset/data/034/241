Good day Sir,

My name is Dr.David James an attorney and  personal Lawyer to late Engr. Mark Stephen estate. Engr. Mark Stephen was a Member of board of directors of some blue chip companies . He retired in 1992 and
Started oil lifting business till his death on the 4th of May 2002 in a
plane crash in which his wife and two children died. They have since been buried. May their Soul rest in Peace!

Please see the following website for information about the plane crash 
Wereover100 people died:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1968300.stm
http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/africa/01/30/nigeria.crash/
http://www.usafricaonline.com/ngrplane.crash

Engr. Mark until his death made some good money for himself and family 
While in active service and in his business since he has several oil blocks both in Angola and Congo.

The reason for my contacting you is that there was a Deposit he has with Lion Bank Nigeria PLC amounting to US$12.3Million. This deposit has been in the vault of Lion Bank PLC for close to two years after the Man’s death. The Management of the Bank has mandated me to provide the next-of-kin to the man within two weeks or else the money will be 
Confiscated.

To this effect, I have made several efforts to locate any relative of 
the man but have failed to make any meaningful Progress.The Bank's requirement in this kind of Situation is that once somebody comes forward as the next of kin of a late customer With necessary proof, the 
money will be processed and wired to that person. But if nobody show up, after three years the money will be deposited into unclaimed
funds account,Now that the deadline given is at hand, I would like
you to assist me in recovering this money from the Bank as
the man's next-of-kin. There Will be all necessary documentation to see to this.

The procedure for approval is simple once you indicate your interest, an affidavit of claim will be made and a letter of administration obtained from the probate Registry which will authorize the release of the funds to you. This documents and some others will be notarized and forwarded to the Management of Lion Bank PLC for Vetting. After that, the document will be forwarded to the office of the Managing Director for approvals.

So you can see that there is no risk in this transaction. Everything 
will be properly arranged.

As you can see time is of great essence as the Management of Lion Bank PLC has given me  deadline. Contact me through my personal email dr_davidjames2002@mail2lawyer.com so that I will give you more
information. But were you are not capable to do this transaction, please let me know so that I can look for another person that will be capable.

I expect to hear from you immediately.

Regards,
Dr.David James.
