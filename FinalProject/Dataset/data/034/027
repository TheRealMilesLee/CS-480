It is time for you to step in and force an internal transfer. You and I know this has gone on far too long and needs to be transferred to EGAS's books.

Doug,
I will bring this issue up with EGAS management - - will revert with their feedback on this internal accounting transfer (i.e., no new cash to Enron) as well as the trasnfer of associated interest gonig forward, etc.  We need to consider the potential effect to Enron of this internal transfer from the perspective of legal strategies as well as current restructuring efforts with the lenders.  

On another matter: have not heard from you regarding the Venezuela trading assistance (from Vengas).  

Thanks, Mariella

With SECLP being shutdown for almost two months and no positive news in sight I think we need to address the internal transfer of $28 million to settle the outstanding fuel bill. There is no longer a reason for this to remain on EFI's receivables and we need to settle the account.
