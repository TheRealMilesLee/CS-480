Janelle,
I trust you on the hotel.  I assume you have also enlisted a travel agent?

Kim,
I don't remember a request for passport numbers, so you need ours?

Interesting that tourist season ends in Sept but it still appears to be
full.

Hi Guys!
We're having a small amount of trouble finding a hotel in Rome on the front 
end.  So I'm going to ratchet the price level up somewhat.  If anyone has a 
problem with that - let me know.  (But be aware, you will be asked to name 
that tune and make the long distance phone calls.)
Also - to Paul and Judy - the Sheraton near the airport was full for the 
tailend of the trip.  So I'm still looking for something near the airport 
for October 11 for the 4 of us.
Also - to Kim - will send passport #'s later.  I haven't been by the bank to

pick up Dennis' passport yet.
Talk to you later,
Janell
