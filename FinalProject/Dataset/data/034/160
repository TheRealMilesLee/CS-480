Call Joanna Scruggs 602-417-9300

ask for the overlay statewide digital index map ($18.50).  They recently
updated it to 1996 vintage.  The scale is 1:750,000.  From this map you
can order the 1:100,000 scale BLM maps ($4 each).  Checks can be sent
to:

Arizona Public Land Information Center
222 North Central Ave.
Suite 101
Phoenix, AZ  85004

I don't know if they take credit cards, but if they do, it might speed
up processing.  You may just want to order the big scale map and all the
smaller ones and save some time.

regards,
kh
