At today's CPUC meeting the Commissioners once again did not act on the proposed decision to unbundle the SoCal system.  Without any comment, the GIR agenda item was Held Over to the next meeting as they have done the last 2 months.

On PG&E's application for approval of open season procedures (which PG&E filed to withdraw), Chairman Lynch stated that the proposed decisions (3 variations) were being Held Over not withdrawn.  I'll follow-up.

The next meeting is scheduled for Sept. 6th.  gh
