Title: Mexico Power Markets: Slowing Economy Pulls Down Power Demand Growth 	
URL(s):

***********************************************************************

MEXICO'S SLOWING ECONOMY AFFECTS POWER GENERATION GROWTH
Electricity production growth rates in Mexico have slowed dramatically from
2000 levels as Mexico's economy slows in line with that of the United States.
Natural gas consumption by the power sector continues to grow at over 15
percent annually, however, as new combined-cycle power plants enter service.
Many new capacity projects are also delayed, keeping the market tight through
the summer. Mexico's longer-term power supply and demand balance will depend on

* successful completion of the pending power sector reform process

* sufficient new capacity through the independent power producer program to 
bridge the transition from the current structure to a competitive market
