Dear Friend,

Kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to you. Although we never met before, I have every reason to believe that you are a highly respected personality, I know you will definitely take this as a deceptive e mail,because of the swindle news we hear everyday and now it happens am  from Nigeria where it seems to happen more 
often.Let me first of all inform you, i got your e.mail id from a mail directory and decided to e.mail you for apermission to go ahead.

My name is Mr Olujimi Williams, the Excutive Director of Societe Generale Bank of Nigeria. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account number 14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in the Tsunami disasters

Since the demise of this our customer,I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of twenty eight million five hundred thousand united states dollars which has been with my branch for a very long time.

On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin.
 And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than three years,because money will be recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period.I will give you 25% of the total.

Upon the receipt of your response, I will send you by fax or e-mail the application, bank's fax number and the next step to take. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer  can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply to the bank 
as a relation to the deceased.

When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail  signifying your decision Including your private Tel/Fax numbers for quick communication.

Respectfully submitted,

Mr Olujimi Williams
