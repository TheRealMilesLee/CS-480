Hopefully, when everything is done, it'll be considered quite a bit better than reasonable.  In addition to the $2.0MM cash we should receive next week, the following are included in the deal:

- at least another $1.5MM cash during January
- no further EPCSC expenditures, except for my staff; i.e., GTB assumes all outstanding purchase commitments
- follow-on profitable work consulting for the replacement contractor and/or GTB (scope & rates still to be negotiated)
- a project profit of close to $4MM, about as much as we would have made if the contract were completed, but with no further project risk

I obviously didn't include these items in the report due to the wide distribution.

Have a great holiday.

Jerry

This sounds like a reasonable result.
