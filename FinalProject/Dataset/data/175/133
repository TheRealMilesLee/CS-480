Dear, 

Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal Eth=
ics.
I introduce myself as Liam a staff in the accounts management Section of
a well-known bank here in the United Kingdom.

One of our accounts with holding balance of =A315,000,000(Fifteen Million=

British Pounds) has been dormant and last operated in the past 3 years.

From my investigations and confirmations, the owner of this account is a
Foreigner by name Gerald Stone died on the 4th of January 2002 on a plane=

crash in Birmingham here in UK. Since then nobody has done anything as re=
gards
the claiming of this money as he has no family Member who is aware of the=

existence of either the account nor the Funds. Information from the Natio=
nal
Immigration also states that he was single on entry into the UK.

I have confidentially discussed this issue with some of the bank official=
s
and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. We th=
us
propose to do business with you, standing in as the next of kin of these
funds from the deceased and funds released to you after due processes hav=
e
been followed.

This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is Legi=
timate
and does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other
Illegal act.

On your interest, let me hear from you.

Regards,
Liam.
