Clipped from the article from Kevin Seifert, Star Tribune

Vikings quarterback Todd Bouman, declaring that the injured thumb on 
his throwing hand is much better, said today he's ready to go Sunday 
against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

"I took all of the snaps today,'' said Bouman, who has moved up to 
startiang quarterback after Daunte Culpepper injured his knee. "The 
thumb is a little sore, but I'll be ready to go on Sunday."

Bouman continued: "I've come a long way the last couple of days. With 
all of the treatment I have gotten, I can squeeze the ball and I can 
throw pretty much anything I want to throw, so I don't foresee it 
being a problem."

The St. Cloud State product injured his thumb in the team's 27-24 
loss last Sunday to Detroit. 

Bouman has had limited practice action this week. Backup Spurgeon 
Wynn has taken more snaps the past few days, and the team brought in 
Ramaro Miller, cut in training camp, should he have been needed to 
back up Wynn.

Bouman today called dealing with the injury just "part of the game. 
You've just got to come in and get treatment, and hopefully things 
will turn around fast. It's progressed each day, and that's all you 
can do."

He said there's a risk that it could be re-injured Sunday. "It's not 
going to heal until the season is over. So any time if you get hit on 
it, it's going to re-injure it or aggravate it. But you've just got 
to deal with it."

Concerning Culpepper's surgery, Green said today that it "went as 
expected ... and he has a positive prognosis. Daunte's rehabilitation 
will begin immediately."

While there's be no definitive word on when Culpepper might return to 
the lineup, he could end up missing the season's remaining three 
games. The consequence of that appears minimal, considering the 
Vikings are virtually eliminated from a playoff berth.

****************************

Our View:  With Todd taking all the snaps on Thursday, he is a very 
safe bet to start on Sunday.  Culpepper is not expected to return 
this season so Todd should start the remainder of the season unless 
he is injured further.
