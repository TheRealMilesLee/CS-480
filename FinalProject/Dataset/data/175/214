Thanks - that's what I needed to know.  I'm still not sure if it is a two-way termination (yes I know the difference) because there's no language that indicates we'd be paid if we're in the money in a termination.  There is a provision that allows us to cease delivery "by reason of ... significant change in operating condition"; if we don't deliver, there's an LD calculation, which if positive, we have to pay.  There doesn't appear to be any language that causes WEPCo to pay us if we don't deliver and we're in the money.  (Hence my question to David) Otherwise, the only way to terminate is with one year's advance written notice - there are no Event of Default provisions and remedies, such as for bankruptcy. (Which I'm assuming you know since you're familiar with the contract).  What I didn't know was your longer term view of the market - this obviously matters in evaluating their offer if the contract is one way and we are unhedged.  In any event, for now they can either pay us the $1.2 million or we'll plan on delivering in January.  I'll call them onWed and let you know so we can schedule delivery is necessary.

Wisconsin's offer is a joke.   
 
Carl - This is is clearly a two-way termination or they would have no offer at all (I'm assuming you understand the difference).   We can buy Cal-02 Com-Ed under $30/Mwh all day long.   This is a position we will deliver on to preserve the in-the money value.   I would make it clear to Wisconsin that we intend on delivering in January and every single month thereafter because it creates positive cash flow for the estate.   We also have broker quotes that show the market is 28 at 29 for Cal 02.   I would accept nothing less  than $1.2 million.
 
Thanks.

This contract is for 50Mw peak into COMED, Seller's Daily Choice, Cal '02 @ $34.75/MWh.  Our MTM is $1,244,412; their offer is $663,000.  It appears to be a one-way contract, but it's hard to tell given the brevity of the contract.  David - what happens if we don't serve the load - do we get nothing?  We need to decide if we want to begin serving the load and negotiate a better price - they want to have done by 12/28.
