Digital Broadcasting Revolution (4th Edition) <http://bookshop.informamedia.com/dbr/?src=dbremail>

By 2006 the world's leading seven countries are forecast to have 148 million digital TV homes - one third of the global total!

Dear MR M MC CONNELL, 

 Front Cover <http://bookshop.informamedia.com/cod/logos/publishing/imgt0001cover.jpg>The digital TV sector is continually evolving, enabling the expansion of new revenue-generating services. Traditional broadcasting models have been superseded by new services that cross into related industries, most notably the telecoms sector. However, the proposed analogue switch-off is still in the distance - we are now entering a crucial period as other platforms vie for a niche in the digital market. 

Digital Broadcasting Revolution (4th Edition), the latest edition of the best selling report from Informa Media Group, addresses the key issues in the developing digital broadcasting sector. Providing you with the necessary intelligence to make informed decisions, the report: 

* investigates the future direction of digital broadcasting 
* focuses on new and emerging digital technologies and the provision of new revenue streams
* evaluates which of the emerging digital platforms will be successful
* contains extensive digital settop box forecasts up to 2006
* provides in-depth profiles of the world's leading seven countries in the sector. 

New to this edition: 

Substantially expanded and fully updated, the latest edition also contains entirely new chapters on: 

* Content and rights focusing on business strategies to exploit multiple digital platforms
* Regulation and piracy as broadband Internet makes audiovisual piracy relatively easy. 

Digital broadcasting content is increasing in sophistication and broadband Internet offers an important new market in which rights owners can fully exploit their content. Digital Broadcasting Revolution (4th Edition) contains case studies on leading companies, such as Canal+ and Microsoft, allowing you to assess your market position and learn from the experience of market leaders. 

Supported by a wealth of tables, statistics and forecasts, Digital Broadcasting Revolution (4th Edition) is essential reading for anyone requiring topical, up-to-date information on the global digital broadcasting sector.
