Hello Amy
In a previous mail, you mentioned we could go to the police station 
to pick up maps and balloons. I looked in yahoo what was the nearest 
station and it says it is in beechnut street. Is it the station you 
are talking about or is there another one closer to our area ? If so 
would you be kind enough to tell me where it is ? Thanks a lot.
Michel Cahier
