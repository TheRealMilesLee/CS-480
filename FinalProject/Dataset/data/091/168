John,

Just passing on some nightly info. it looks like the last four nights HE 23-24 have been very strong averaging in the mid 20's. The west printed negative on the 19th and 20th HE 20-21.  Calpine and Aquila were offering $14-$15 power for HE 23-24 every night.  Const or Mirant were $15-$16 bids.  I sold the 30mw short term ercot was long @ $13.5 to CPS.  


Alex
