John, have you had a chance to get this fixed?  Katina in the back office would like to get this reconciled.  

Thanks,

Hi Clint,

I am emailing you to find out if you have gotten any information on this counter party for August production on the 400mw and the Sept production for the calculation of the dollars on the 8050mw that we purchased from COA. Please update me on the status at you earliest.

Thank you!!!!!!
