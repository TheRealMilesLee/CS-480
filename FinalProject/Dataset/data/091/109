<P><STRONG>FROM: Mrs. Hilda Achums.</STRONG></P>
<P><BR><STRONG>In Lordship. I am the above named person from Nigeria but now undergoing medical treatment. I was married to Dr.Roberts Achums who worked with Malaysia embassy in&nbsp;NIGERIA for nine years, before he died in the year 2003. We were both married for eleven years without children.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both very close as husband and wife and since his death I decided not to re-marry. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of USD15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million United States Dollars) with a Inland Bank Nig Plc, I will send you details as soon as you indicate your interest.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Six months due to my cancer illness. Having known my condition and believing the doctor I have decided to donate this fund to avoid total loss to&nbsp; Less privilege, or better still an&nbsp; individual that will utilize this mone!
y the way I am going to instruct here in.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I want interested&nbsp; firm,or individual that will receive and use this money to help, orphanages ,widows and propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Please do not fail to spread the funds across the globe especially AFRICA as soon as you receive the money. it is more blessed to give than to receive. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are fighting over the properties and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by their greedy attitude. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an UNGODLY manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I am a good person.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health, and because of the presence of my husband's relatives around !
me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact information of the bank and other details that will enable you claim the funds.please i want you to be aware that according to my attorney there are some important document that will be required by the bank for the transfer this is where i will need your little assistance before the fund can be transfer with the help of my attorney.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I will also issue you a letter of authority/Power of Attorney that will make you the beneficiary of this fund. I want you to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the GOD must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be<BR>prayerful all through your life.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I sent you this mail under severe pains. Any delay in your reply will be detrimental. Please assure me that you!
 will act accordingly.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Hoping to hear from you immediately.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Yours in Christ,</STRONG></P>
<P><BR><STRONG>Mrs. Hilda Achums.</STRONG></P><BR><BR><BR><BR>--------------------------------------
