FYI,

John Sturn ran some numbers to see if we could put units 1&2 on for a test run. Here are the details. I told Kim at Tescott, to work with the Controllers to get the go ahead.

The configuration below should be fairly workable.  If tomorrow's demands come out about like they are looking, it could be done then.



Bushton bypass D-E to D-E and compresses about 200 MM/D of recompress to the D-E.  Tescott runs 1 and 2 with a common D-E suction to an E discharge and cracks to the D discharge.  This setup pretty well isolates all the changes to Tescott.  It does not involve a lot compression changes at other stations or moving pack around.  So it ought to be relatively easy to set up and take apart when the test is done.

Questions or comments, let me know.


John

Subject:	Test run Units #1 & #2

We would like to test units #1 and #2 to complete the Station debugging for these units.  We would like to do this, this week  or next week if possible as we are approaching warmer weather. To do this we would like to run the units for a several hours when the higher flows are needed then if we need to we can slip unit 5 on for unattended operations or take unit 5 down early and run unit #1 & #2 until not needed.  Please let us know what the outlook is so we can plan for this.

If you have any questions feel free to call 785-283-4225
