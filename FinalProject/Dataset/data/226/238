Amy,


Lyda has a size 12 heavy duty jacket with a hood.  She has several turtle
necks.  Most of our winter clothes are in Colorado, Leadville, to be
exact.  Will you be near there, Copper Mountain, for example?  We're on
the other side of the mountains from Ken Lay's houses, if that's where
you're going, and Independence Pass is closed at this time of the year.
