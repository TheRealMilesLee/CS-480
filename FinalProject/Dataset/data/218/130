     Sally,
     
     We may have an issue in that a power of attorney may be required in 
     order you guys in Houston to use accounts in the name of London. Our 
     legal people are currently reviewing the matter. If it turns out that 
     it is required I have the following names:
     
     Paul Garcia
     
     Nina Swisher
     
     Reginald Hart
     
     Are there any other names that should go on this POA?
     
     Regards,
     Vito
