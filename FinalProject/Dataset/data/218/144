	Mack,

	This will confirm our telephone conference of just a moment ago.  Your client gave you authority to agree to extend for another two weeks, until Tuesday, February 12, 2002, the bilateral deadline by which either EEPC or SWPC must respond or object to pending discovery.

	I would greatly appreciate it if you would confirm by e-mail that I have correctly described our discussion.

	Also, please be advised that today we served a subpoena on the Fritz Companies for documents and information related to the importation of the two SWPC generators aboard the INDUSTRIAL BRIDGE.

	Many thanks.  Have a good weekend.

	Britt
