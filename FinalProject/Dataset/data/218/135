Lindy, Tony and Sam:

Thank you very much for the fun visit this past weekend.  Of course the
highlight of our trip was being with Sam.  I don't have to tell you we
really miss that bright, shining face!  It's amazing how quickly you
become attached.  When we woke up Tuesday morning we both said how much
we already missed being able to be with him.  He spoiled us quickly.  I
told Lisa and John they should go and visit to enjoy his adorable
personality and fun age.  

Our trip home was not what we expected, but it could have been worse.
Going through Chicago seemed a round about way to get to Omaha from
Houston, but it worked out fine and we arrived here only about 2 hours
later than the original schedule.  Flying can definitely be an
adventure.

I not only miss Sam, but I miss your warm weather too!  It is cold and
dreary today and the weatherman said we will probably have snow tonight
and tomorrow.  I shouldn't complain--this winter has been wonderful.
But at the same time I truly enjoyed not having to wear a coat.  

I know you are looking forward to having the next two days off from work
(plus the weekend).  

Thanks again for the nice visit.  We really had a good time.  Give Sam
hugs and kisses from us.  We miss all of you!

Love you.

Flo and Papa Flo
