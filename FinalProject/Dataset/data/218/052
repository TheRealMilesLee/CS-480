Hi My Man,
 
Yokos! mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm    I went to see Dr. Soot today, she told me my pain is from the 2 big knots where they started and ended the incisions, and it will only hurt for ...oh....3 months or so.  She also said I can do whatever I want, including the gym! Your ASS is MINE!  ;)  She said lifting etc is fine as long as I listen to my pain and lift things slowly. No jerky or quick lifting that could hurt me.
 
I can't wait to have some albacore sashimi and a little Craig on the sheetsheemi!  ;)
 
Love,
 
C
