Dear Friend,
Greetings in sincerity, I am former
Mrs.Fatima Setia, now Mrs. Chritiana Ahmed, a widow to Late Sheik 
Mohammed Setia from sri lan ka, I am 74years old, I am now a new Christia=
n
convert,
This happened few days after the tsunami disaster across
the South East Asian region on 26th to 30th December,  which my family wa=
s
also a victim.
 From all indications my condition is really deteriorating and it's quite=

obvious that
 I won't live more than two months according to my doctors. This is becau=
se
the injury
 I substained and my high b.p level  has gotten to a very bad stage.
My husband was buried alive in the devilish landslide right here in our
home.
 we couldn't produce any child. My late husband was very wealthy and afte=
r
his 
death,no body remains to inherit all his business and wealth. The doctor
has advised me 
that I may not live for more than two months, so I now decided to divide

part of this wealth, to contribute to the victims of the landslide partic=
ularly
in sri lanka,indonesia,  Philippines ,
 and thailand.This prompted me  to look for a neutral and God fearing per=
son
to handle this as my condition 
will not permit me to do so.I AVOIDED MUCH FAMILIARITY FOR PERSONAL REASO=
NS.
I selected you aft er visiting the website and I prayed over it, I
am willing to donate the sum of $24.342,000.00 Million euros to
you for this assignment provided you guarrantte me judicious use of the
fund for this purpose
. Please I want you to note that, this
fund is lying in a Security company in Europe and upon my instruction, yo=
u
will file in an 
application for the transfer of the money in your name.
Lastly, I honestly pray that this money when transferred will be
used for the said purpose, because I have come to find out that wealth
acquisition without Christ is vanity upon vanity.You use 10% of the fund
for contigency.
REMAINS BLESS.
Please do contact my laywer his email address:george_colstas@ureach.com:N=
ame
George Colstas,
I await your urgent reply.
Yours in Charity
Mrs.Christiana
