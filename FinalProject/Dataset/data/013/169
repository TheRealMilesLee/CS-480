My Good Friend,

From: Mrs Mary Jones
PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USED IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.

I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married
to Dr.Harry Jones who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for
nine years before he died in the year 2000. We were married for eleven
years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for
only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.

Since his death I decided not to re- marry or get a child outside my
matrimonial home which the Bible is against.When my late husband was
alive he deposited the sum of$8.6Million (Eight Million and six hundred
thousand U.S. Dollars) with one finance/security company in Amsterdam
Holland.
Presently, this money is still with the Security Company. Recently, my
Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to
cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness.
Having known my condition I decided to donate  this fund to churches or
better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the
way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use this
fund to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of
God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made
us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this
decision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money
and my husband relatives are not Christians and I dont want my
husbands hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want
a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence
the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence
I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of
the Lord.

Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I
shall hold my peace. I dont need any telephone communication in this
regard, because of my health and because the presence of my husbands
relatives around me always. I dont want them to know about this
development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive
your reply I shall give you the contact of the Finance/Security Company
in Amsterderm Holland . I will also issue you a letter of authority that
will prove you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and
the church  to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My
happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that
wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please
always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will
give me room in sourcing for a church or christian individual for this
same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated
herein. Hoping to hear from you.
Yours in Christ,
Mrs Mary Jones.
