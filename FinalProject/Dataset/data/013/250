Kevin,

I found out that we are not close at this point to a corp. contract with Energy Central.  You would need to obtain a singe license user which is as follows:

Daliy Electric News	$191.00 Annually
Daily Gas News		$191.00 Annually 
For Both		$382.00 Annually

If you were to sign up this way and we did sign a corp. contract, Energy Central would credit you for the difference.

In the meantime, in response to your question, yes we can help you with this.  The best thing to do is go to http://esource.enron.com  at the top tool bar click on Request a Search.  Enter all of the detail you are looking for, and your timeline and we will be able to fill your request.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me.

Thank you

Susan

In the meantime, do you guys have access to any gas supply production forcasts for the Rockies and San Juan Basin areas.  I'm looking into developing a new pipeline project and need to verify the gas supply will be there to fill the pipe.  Let me know.
thanks

Kevin,

Just a follow up.  I have put in a request for your Dow Jones User Id and password.  I should have this by tomorrow.  I have left a message for Ben Smith at Energy Central, and once I speak to him, I will let you know.


If there is anything else in the mean time, do not hesitate to call me.

Thank you

Susan
