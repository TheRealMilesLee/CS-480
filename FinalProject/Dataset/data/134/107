I am Dr Daniel Sogolo, (Herd of Security Services)  ECOBANK PLC of Nigeri=
a,
Lagos Branch. Six(6) years ago  Mr. Christian Eich, an engineer who ran
carmaker BMW's museum.He died with his  wife and two children and his wif=
e's
parents were also among the victims of plane crash of Monday, 31 July, 20=
00,
13:22 GMT 14:22 UK.
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/europe/859479.stm
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm 

On June 6, 1999, he made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calen=
dar
months, valued at ($12.2million united state dollars) in my bank. Upon ma=
turity,
I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.=

After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  con=
tract
employers, that Mr. Mr. Christian Eich died from an plane crash . On furt=
her
investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all att=
empts
to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investi=
gation
and discovered that Mr. Christian Eich did not declare any kin or relatio=
ns
in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my=

Bank.

So, recently the chairman of the board of directors of the bank called me=

and told me in confidence and trust to source for a reliable foreigner wh=
o
would stand as our banker?s next of kin. So, this sum ($12.2million unite=
d
state dollars) is still sitting in our bank and the interest is being rol=
led
over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever com=
e
forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 7 (f=
ive)
years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government,=

if nobody applies to claim the fund. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I will [would] like you as an Foreigner=

to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Christian Eich so that the fruits
of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt gover=
nment
officials.

If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email add=
ress
sogolo_dr@yahoo.com upon your response, I shall then provide you with mor=
e
details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transact=
ion.


Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transac=
tion
would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assi=
stance
to invest my share in your country. 

Best Regards,

Dr Daniel Sogolo
(Herd of Security Services),
