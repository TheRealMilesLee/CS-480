you may be the individual my company is looking for.</font></p>

From the shrink-sleeve extend to the shrink-sleeve colorful twin pot,<br>
The material used   for this twin port is shock resistance <br>
and it has been design for improved watering feature <br>
and especially the living environment for bonsais.The material used<br>
 in the vase is basically created by ultraviolet rays, and it is also self-protected <br>
from insects; these would give further protection to bonsai from <br>
external harmfulness.<br>
There are many choices of colour and pattern for the vases,<br>
 it can be also self-designed to be more customised and personalised items. <br>
