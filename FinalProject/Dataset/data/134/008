Dear=2C

I am Mrs=2E Tamara Ndoro=2C wife of late Mr=2E Dennis Ndoro=2C 
who was murdered by the Zimbabwean veterans and irate 
black people=2E Before the death of my husband on the 
1st of march 2003=2C he was a Prosperous Tobacco and 
Coffee farmer in Zimbabwe and one of the major 
sponsor=2F Financier of the opposition party -Movement 
For Democratic Change =28MDC=29in Zimbabwe =2EHe was also 
the

former president of Farmers Co-operative Trade Union
in Zimbabwe=2E I am writing you from Johannesburg South 
Africa=2E I got your contact e-mail address through the 
South African International Information Exchange 
Centre and decided to write you=2E I write to solicit 
for your special assistance to a family shattered by 
a tyrannical government led by the dictator President
Robert Mugabe and his=28ZANU-PF=29 ruling party=2E

I am probably one of the conviction that you are aware
of the present situation in my country Zimbabwe sequel 
to the land and farm land crisis in Zimbabwe=2C the 
government secretly sponsored the war veterans
and some irate party members to dispose the land being 
occupied by whites and some rich farmers who are 
opposed to his consistent stay in power and his radical
and unnecessary reforms targeted at his political
opponents=2E This action has led to the killing of 
some members of the opposition party including my 
husband=28Mr=2E Dennis Ndoro=29=2C who did not support this 
ill-fated action=2E 

But before the death of my husband and the consistent 
threats to his life=2C he anticipated some dangers and 
so he smuggled out the sum of US$20=2Em=28Twenty Million 
United States Dollars=29=2C to South Africa since it is 
the nearest neighbouring country and deposited it in 
a security company with the intention of using it for 
the purchase of New farm machinery and chemicals for 
Agricultural purposes in South Africa as well as a 
purchase of some hectares of land in Swaziland=2E On 
the 1st march=2C 2002=2C the war veterans and some 
supporters of =28ZANU-PF=29ruling party trooped into our 
compound and axed him=28my husband=29 to death=2E Since 
then=2C they have been terrorizing my only son=2C
=28Johnson Ndoro=29=2C but I succeeded to work for his 
escape to a neighbouring country=2C South Africa as a 
political asylum seeker =28refugee=29=2E 

But his position in South Africa does not permit him 
to open an account or normalise this fund for any 
meaningful business transaction in south Africa since 
He does not have a south Africa Identity Card=2E That 
is why I want this fund to be transferred into your 
Nominated account so that you will assist him to 
invest it in your country=2E Hence=2C if you agree to 
assist us=2C we have two options for you=2C we have 
agreed to go into partnership with you and your family 
or in the alternative=2C we offer you 25% of the money 
for your assistance=2C5% will be for the possible 
expenses incurred in the process of this transaction=2C 
while 70% will be for our family investment in your 
country=2C through your assistance=2E

I want you to understand that this fund is purely a 
family fund=2F money and not drug money=2C nor could it 
be classified as government fund or Money Laundering 
affairs and relevant authorities could substantiate it 
by our attorney=2E It is Family fund but termed 
confidential because I do not want my son to be traced 
to where he is presently=2E If you are interested in 
assisting us=2C kindly contact my son =28Mr=2EJohnson Ndoro=29
Tel+27-73-232-2904=2CEmail=28mr=5Fjohnson=5Fndoro=40yahoo=2Eco=2Ein=29 
or myself with this email address=2C and the telephone 
number above=2E Right now=2C I am presently in south Africa 
with Johnson my son and the whole of my family sequel 
to the tensed political situation and the fear for our 
lives in Zimbabwe=2E I need your urgent and confidential 
response=2E
