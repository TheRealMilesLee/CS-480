Dear Friend,
           REQUEST FOR URGENT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL
After due deliberation with my colleagues, I decided to forward this prop=
osal.
We want a reliable person who could assist us to transfer the sum of Thir=
ty
Million United States Dollars (US$30,000,000.00) into his/her account.

This fund resulted from an over-invoced bill from contract awarded by us
under the budget allocation to my ministry and the bill was approved for
payment by the concerned ministries. The contract has been executed, comm=
issioned
and the contractor was paid the actual cost of the contract. we are left
with the balance of US$30,000,000.00 as part of the over-invoiced amount,=

which we have deliberately over estimated, for our own I am contacting yo=
u
to be
our custodian for this fund.

1. 20% for you (Account Owner)
2. 70% for us
3. 10% for Tax, as may required by our Government and yours.

As you may want to know and to make you less curious,I got your address
from adverts, in business directory that protrayed your establishment in
good light. I am the Secretary of the Contract Awarding Committee (CAC)of=

the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). This transaction is
very much free from all sorts of RISK and TROUBLE from my Government. We
have been exercising patience for this opportunity for so long and to mos=
t
of us this is a life time opportunity we cannot affford to miss. To get
this fund paid into your account, we have to present a Payment Invoice fr=
om
a foreign establishment like yours. With this invoice, we will seek appro=
val
to transfer the fund within 14 banking days through the APEX BANK to your=

designatd Bank Account.

I and one of my colleague involved in this deal will come to your country=

to arrange for our share upon the confirmation from you that the money ha=
s
been credited into your nominated Bank Account. Consequently upon your ac=
ceptance
of my proposal,kindly confirm your interest by revert mail to the above
e/mail address It will surprise you why we choose you and trusted you for=

this transaction. Yes, we believe that good friends can be discovered and=

business like this cannot be realized without trust. This is why we have
decided to trust you for this transaction. we are looking forward to doin=
g
this transaction with you.

Be further informed that everyone's interest and security had been consid=
ered
before you were contacted. So be rest assured and feel free to go into th=
is
transaction with us. But let honesty be our watch word throughout this tr=
ansaction
and your prompt reply will be highly appreciated.

Best regards,
234-803-440-1998

Dr.John Ebere.
