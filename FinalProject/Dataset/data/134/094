Billy Lemmons & I met on Friday regarding the Analyst and Associate program.  We would like to implement the following action items as it relates to the program.  Let me know if you have any concerns or questions with the items below:

Action Plan
Halt all recruiting efforts
Rescind offers with start dates thru end of February 2002
No change (as of now) with offers starting Summer 2002
Complete several internal transfers into program - stop all future internal transfers into program
Immediately cut 4 and 5 rated Associates and Analysts
Reduce remainder of group consistent with commercial organizations
Roll A/A program into HR reporting to David Oxley
Reduce administrative staff significantly

Current Program
Approximately 520 A/A in Western Hemisphere, with 35 staff
Approximately 225 A/A in Eastern Hemisphere, with 9 staff
