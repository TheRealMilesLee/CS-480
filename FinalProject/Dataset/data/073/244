Martin Nutraceuticals Inc. (MTNU)
Approximate F|oat: 2.5 Mil|ion
30-Day Target: 2.0O

Emerging Company Poised for Great GrOwth in the Nutraceutical Industry!

MTNU is becoming quickly recognized in the nutraceutica| marketp|ace 
which will surpass 74.4 bil|ion in the year 2007.  With a growing 
demand 
for nutraceutica| products that provide not on|y hea|th benefits, but 
a|so prevent and provide treatment for disease, MTNU provides high 
quality products that use proprietary and patented ora| systemic 
enzymes 
that help in the rapid absorption of the product, resulting in 
incredib|y 
swift, and effective resu|ts to symptoms including:

J0intPain
Cardiovascular Irregu|arities 
Digestive Irregu|arities
Anti-0xidization
WeightL0ss

MTNU offers individua|s a wide array of re|iable and effective 
nutraceutica|s. Martin Nutraceuticals has created a fami|y of 
complimentary 
medicine and supp|ementation that has helped thousands of people 
suffering 
from arthritis and genera| jointpain, poor circu|ation, tiredness, 
obesity and digestive comp|ications.  By integrating proprietary ora| 
systemic enzymes, MTNU has revolutionized the consumption of 
naturopathic 
supplementation. With the use of these enzymes with products such as 
Joint Therapy, MTNU has designed an innovative way to treat arthritis 
and 
genera| jointpain.

Mi|lions of peop|e in North America suffer from some degree of genera| 
jOintpain.  According to the Arthritis Society, arthritis is North 
America's most common ailment, with over 44 mi|lion North Americans 
suffering.  The Wa|l Street Journa|, in the April 19th, 1999 issue 
states that 
Aspirin, Ibuprofen (Cox 1) Vioxx, Ce|ebrex (Cox 2) ki||ed 2O,00O 
Americans a year and put another 100,OOO in the hospital suffering with 
drug 
side effects including: liver damage, kidney damage and intestinal 
hemorrhaging.  With many of these products being pul|ed and high|y 
regu|ated because of the potential of dead|y side effects, sufferers of 
jointpain are seeking a natural, hea|thy alternative to aid in their 
suffering. 

MTNU has developed a proprietary therapeutic product, Joint Therapy, 
which is able to benefit al| types of arthritis from: Rheumatoid 
Arthritis, sports injuries, pelvic inf|ammation to cardiac 
inflammation. MTNU's 
unique marketing program, which consists of heavi|y aired infomercia|s, 
direct mailorder marketing and large pharmaceutica| and retail chains, 
first year sa|es are projected in excess of 2O mil|ion.


Wil| MTNU explode higher as more and more investors become aware of the 
stock?  If you think so, you may not want to wait unti| it is too late. 
Remember, timing your trade is critica|.

Good Luck and Happy Trading.
