We met in Derivative I training.  I have recently completed Derivatives II.  

I think that I would be an excellent candidate for this position. 

I have the educational requirement; 
a modest, but broad level of exposure to the power industry and our products; 
excellent communication skills; 
very strong spreadsheet skills; 
I do not mind shift work; 
and, above all, a strong desire to learn trading.

I would like to meet or discuss anytime at your convenience.
