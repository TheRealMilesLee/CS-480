In the past Legal has vigorously pursued anyone registering a domain name containing "enron" -- I believe it's something they do of their own accord.  So I'm expecting the answer "no chargeback" from Legal.  But I'll let you know.

Do you remember what you typed into the search box?  I tried "emissions" and did not come across old content.  I understand that the page you cite is out there, and we can take it down, but I also want to fix whatever led the search engine to return that page.
