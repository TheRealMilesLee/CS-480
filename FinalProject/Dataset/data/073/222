So far I have spoken to both Bill and Rick Buy, both of whom recognized the issue and said they would try to address it.  I have also just completed their budget for next year and increased the number to allow for incremental staff.

I left a message for Bill this morning to see if he had made further progress.

Louise:

Can you tell me if you have made any progress re: resource allocation for Bill Bradford's Credit Group to process deal flow in the West?  I had mentioned to individuals in the Middle Market Group that you were "on it" and if there is a follow up I can give them I would like to do so.

Thanks!

Chris
