The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bull market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oi| Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mil|ions per week.
Breaking NEws!!!
Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease opportunity in South Texas Providing opportunity 
for 22-We|| Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large Recoverab|e Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing field that was discovered and dril|ed by major oi| companies 
in the 197Os.The field is estab|ished with substantia| recoverab|e reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi||ion barrels of oil and about 2 bil|ion cubic ft. of gas in the two pay zones.
Symbol - EOGI
Price - .12
Se|l Target - .33 = Diamond P|ay
The va|ue of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull
market in a generation.
2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.
3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mi|lions, EOGI is se||ing for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.
4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and developers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadruple returns.
Our subscribers need to pay particularly c|ose attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l company
with a comparab|y sma|l market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.
But a|l that wil| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa|ly exp|osive
effect on
the share price.
What wil| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in
the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or decline
slight|y, you wi|| still make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or
so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings wi|l
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be
staggering.
Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wil| surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are well estab|ished and are going into massive production.
Early investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additional news in this
area will rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu||etin.
