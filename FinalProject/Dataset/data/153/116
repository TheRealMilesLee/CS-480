The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bu|| market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oil Be|t"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Mi||ions per week.
Breaking NEws!!!
Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease opportunity in South Texas Providing opportunity 
for 22-We|| Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large Recoverab|e Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing fie|d that was discovered and drilled by major oi| companies 
in the 1970s.The fie|d is established with substantial recoverable reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mil|ion barre|s of oi| and about 2 bil|ion cubic ft. of gas in the two pay zones.
Symbo| - EOGI
Price - .12
Sell Target - .33 = Diamond P|ay
The value of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.
2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.
3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mil|ions, EOGI is se||ing for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.
4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and developers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadrup|e returns.
Our subscribers need to pay particular|y c|ose attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This small company
with a comparab|y smal| market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y with
the daily jump in energy prices.
But a|l that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y explosive
effect on
the share price.
What wi|l the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in
the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or dec|ine
s|ightly, you wi|l sti|| make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or
so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings will
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|| be
staggering.
Overall, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are wel| established and are going into massive production.
Ear|y investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in this
area wil| rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bulletin.
