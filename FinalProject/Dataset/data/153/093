ATTN:Sir/Madam,

My name is Mr Blessing Nwanunaaku the Manager, Credit and Foreign bills o=
f
Regent Bank Plc.

I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account num=
ber
14-255-2004/utb/t whose name is Chung Timothy who perished in a  plane cr=
ash[Korean
Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers  aboard on August  6,1997.And f=
or
your perusal you can view this websitehttp://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/gu=
am.passenger.list/Since
the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched with keen inter=
est
to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to
claim his funds of US$15M (Ffifteen Million United States Dollars)which h=
as
been with my branch for a very long time.

On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the Ne=
xt
of Kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the banking ethic=
s
here does not allow such money to stay more than eight years, because mon=
ey
will be recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period.

In view of this I got your contact through a trade journal after realizin=
g
that your name and country is similar to the deceased.
I will give you 30% of the total. Upon the receipt of your response, I wi=
ll
send you by fax or e-mail the application, bank's fax number and the next=

step  to take.

I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free
and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund tra=
nsfer
can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply to the bank as=

a relation to the deceased.

When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail nwanuakublessing@y=
ahoo.co.in
signifying your
decision including your private Tel/Fax numbers for quick 
communication.

Yours Sincerely,

Mr Blessing Nwanunaaku
