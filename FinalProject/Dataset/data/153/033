Matteo-
Hey!  Got your message.  Thanks for letting me know you got in safely.  Did 
you really not wake me up because you thought I would rather sleep or did 
you come upstairs to find naked people?  I wondered that when I woke up and 
realised you had gone! :) Ooops!

Anyway, what a great night!  Very annoying that the others bailed, but a 
great time none-the-less.  I never realised how many cocktails I had 
consumed, until I woke up the next morning still feeling drunk. Wowe!

So, about Utah....what was the company you found the cheapy tickets at?  
Jeff is getting back to me this week with mountains and clubs and all that 
jazz.  I'll ask him what he recommends about lodging.  We'll be out and 
about so much that I think a B&B or a hotel would do.  If we were staying 
for longer and with a group of people I might look into phat little pads.  
Have you found a Sundance schedule? Are you still thinking the 17th-21st??   
  Can't Wait!!  Kristen
