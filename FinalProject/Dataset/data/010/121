These pills are only like regular pills but they 
are especially formulated to be spoiled and soluble
under the tongue. The lozenges is absorbed at the oral cavity
and goes in the blood instantly alternatively of advancing
through with the tummytum. This results in a quicker more
strong issue which yet up to 22 hours!
