Don't throw the baby out with the bath-water. . There's no use in flogging a dead horse. . Nobody can serve two masters. .
A bad workman blames his tools . Modulation in all things. . Every man is the architect of his destiny. .

No man or woman is worth your tears, and the one who is, won't make you cry. . An elephant never forgets. . As you go through life, make this your goal, watch the doughnut and not the hole. .
