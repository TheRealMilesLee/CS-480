Dear Friend,

In order to transfer out (USD 12.6 M) Twelve million Six Hundred United
States Dollars) from National Westminster Bank uk. I have the courage to
ask you if you are capable,reliable and honest to assist us with this imp=
ortant
business believing that you will never let me down either now or in futur=
e.
I am Mrs. Nancy Brooks, the Chief Auditor of National Westminster Bank (N=
ATWEST
BANK). There is an account opened in this bank in 1998 and since then nob=
ody
has operated on this account again.
After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if
I do not remit this money out urgently,it would be forfeited for nothing.=
The
owner of this account is Mr.Smith B.Andreas,a foreigner,and a miner at kr=
uger
gold co., a geologist by profession,and he died since 1998.He opened a no=
n-residential
U.S dollar bank account.Since then no other person knows about this accou=
nt
or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my in=
vestigation
proved to me as well that this company does not know anything about this
account and the amount involved is (USD 12.6M) Twelve Million, six Hundre=
d
United States Dollars million dollars. I want to first transfer US$6,000,=
000:00
Six million United States Dollars from this money
into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest is transfered, but
I don't have any foreign partner.
I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be appr=
oved
to any other person other than the next of kin to Mr Smith B.Andreas.I kn=
ow
that this message will come to you as a surprise as we do not know oursel=
ves
before now,We wi! ll then sign an agreement,but be sure that it is real
and a genuine business transaction.
I only got your contact address from International Business Directory,wit=
h
believe in God that you will never let me down in this proposed business.=
You
are the only person that I have contacted in this regard,so please reply
urgently so that I will inform you of the next step to take immediately.
Send also your private telephone and fax number including the full detail=
s
of the account to be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face to face=

or sign a binding agreement to bind us together so that you can receive
this money into a any reliable account of your choice where the fund will=

be safe.
And I will fly to your country for withdrawal,sharing and other investmen=
ts
oppourtunities as well.
I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner with forei=
gn
account and foreign beneficiary.I need your full co-operation to make thi=
s
work, because the management is ready to approve this paym! ent to any fo=
reigner
who has correct information of this account which I will provide to you
later.
Furthermore,with my position now in the office I can transfer this money
to any foreigner's reliable account, which you can provide with assurance=

that this money will be intact pending my physical arrival in your countr=
y
for sharing. I will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we
receive this money leaving no trace to any place. You can also come to di=
scuss
with me face to face after which I will make this remittance in your pres=
ence
and two of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the mon=
ey
going into the account.
I will apply for annual leave immediately I hear from you that you are re=
ady
to act and receive this fund in your account. I will use my position and
influence to effect legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to
your account with appropriate clearance forms from the ministries and for=
eign
exchange departments.
At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 30% of the total am=
ount,65%
will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have inc=
urred
during the course of this transaction.
Lastly,if you are intrested in assisting us in this transaction,kindly re=
spond
to my principal partner Mr.Donald at [mrdonduke2@yahoo.co.uk]
Telephone number [009-44-871-474-0435].
