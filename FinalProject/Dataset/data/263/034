Hello, 


We sent you an email a while ago, because you now qualify 

for a much lower rate based on the biggest rate drop in years. 


You can now get $380,000 for as little as $660 a month! 

Bad credit? Doesn't matter, low rates are fixed no matter what! 


Follow this link to process your application and a 24 hour approval:
