SPAMIS Foundation: Strategic Partnership Against Microsoft Illegal Spam 
OUR GOAL: 100 Billion Views in 2005-07 to be Released on Microsoft Spam

----- ---- --- -- -  -    -

MICROSOFT EMPLOYEE MIKE LYMAN SPEAKS OUT ON THEIR SPAMMING POLICIES

"In the past our performance was quite poor and based on most
 standards could be considered spam."

"Two years ago anybody who wanted to bulk email did it their own
 way.  No rules (at least none that I ever could find) and no
 central control and absolutely not central point of contact."

"Lots of things are against policy and people do them every day"

"There was a time with no rules. Everybody did their own thing."

"I've long suspect that stuff like that happened in the past
 when everybody did their own thing with mass mailing here and
 before there was anything resembling a policy or centralized
 system. Considering the nature of this particular mailing, we
 probably stirred up a lot of old garbage."

"In the past our performance was quite poor and based on most
 standards could be considered spam."

"We'll still have clueless wonders making mistakes but hopefully
 we'll have some high level policies to make them expensive
 mistakes."
