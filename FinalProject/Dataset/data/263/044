My name is Michael Havens and I am an artist.I live in west 

Africa,with my two kids, four cats, one dog and the love of
my 

life. It is definitely a full house. I have been doing
artwork 

since I was a small child. That gives me about 23 years of 

experience. I majored in art in high school and took a few 

college art courses. Most of my work is done in either
pencil or 

airbrush mixed with color pencils. I have recently added 

designing and creating artwork on the computer.I have been 

selling my art for the last 3 years and have had my work 

featured on trading cards, prints and in magazines.I have
sold 

in galleries and to private collectors from all around the 

world.I am always facing serious difficulties when it comes
to 

selling my art works to Americans,they are always offering
to 

pay with INTERNATIONAL POSTAL MONEY ORDER ,which is
difficult 

for me to cash here in Africa.

I am looking for a representative in the CANADA OR U.S. who
will 

be working for me as a partime worker and i will be willing
to 

pay %10 for every transaction,which wouldnt affect your
present 

state of work,someone who would help me recieve payments
from my 

customers in CANADA.i mean someone that is responsible and 

reliable,cause the cost of coming to the state and getting 

payments is very expensive,i am working on setting up a
branch 

in CANADA,so for now i need a representative in the CANADA
who 

will be handling the payment aspect.

These payments are in INTERNATIONAL POSTAL MONEY ORDER and
they 

would come to you in your name, so all you need do is cash
the 

money order deduct your percentage and wire the rest back.

But the problem i have is trust,But i have my way of getting

anyone that gets away with our money,i mean the FBI branch
in 

Washington gets involve.
 
It wouldnt cost you any amount,you are to receive payments
which 

will be sent to you by fedex or usps from my business
patners, 

which would come in form of INTERNATIONAL POSTAL MONEY ORDER

then you are to cash it,deduct your 10% and send the balance
to 

me via western union money transfer,all western union
charges 

will be deducted from my balance.

If you are interested,please get back to me as soon as
possible.


Regards
Michael Havens
