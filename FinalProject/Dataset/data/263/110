  <br>
  <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Some people reject God because they can
  find no evidence for Him which satisfies both their hearts and minds
  simultaneously. Then there are others who accept God on the basis of emotional
  or irrational reasons which satisfy their hearts, but leave their minds
  unsure. These two groups of people have never found a satisfying answer to the
  question of their relationship with God. Then there are yet others who have
  found the correct path which God intended for us: to accept Him and His
  message to us using our minds first and foremost, and the heart follows easily
  and naturally as a consequence.<br>
  <br>
  Instead of searching for the answer, there are also some people who chose to
  simply brush the question aside and ignore it unfortunately. This is the easy
  way out of what appears to be a very difficult, mysterious question which may
  seem to have no final solution. Most of these people are unaware of a very
  powerful message which completely and unequivocally establishes the correct
  path to God. This message squares with both the mind and the heart, and it has
  no equal since it comes to us straight from God Himself.<br>
  <br>
  The message comes in the form of a book. In fact, God has given us several
  Books of guidance through the years, but each one was ultimately corrupted and
  changed by dishonest people. Each Book essentially contained the same
  fundamental message as the previous Books. Mankind was expected to guard these
  Books from harm, but unfortunately failed to live up to this expectation.
  Slowly but surely, each Book was edited and tampered with, destroying its
  authenticity. This is partly why God kept sending us more revelations.<br>
  <br>
  However, almost 1400 years ago, God sent us another Book with the same basic
  message as the earlier ones, but with a small but very important difference.
  This time, God decreed that this Book would be the last Book sent down to us
  because God would protect it Himself. Regarding this Final Book, God said,
  &quot;Behold, it is We Ourselves who have bestowed from on high this reminder:
  and behold, it is We who shall truly guard it&quot; [Chapter 15, verse 9]<br>
  <br>
  Today, if we compare the 114 chapters in every copy of this Final Book with
  each other, we will find they match perfectly word for word - from the oldest
  copies made 1300-plus years ago to the ones printed just a few hours ago. No
  human hand has changed it.<br>
  <br>
  The rational person has every right to be doubtful, of course, if he or she
  has never read this book. For such people, here is a small sample of what the
  Final Book contains. Suppose we wanted to ask God several questions about Him
  and about ourselves. Short of Him speaking to us directly (such a privilege
  has been granted to only one person out of all humanity), the Book has the
  best answers one can find. It is on the strength of these answers that an
  honest person may be struck with the conviction that the Final Book is from
  none other than God Almighty. Again, here is only a small part of the
  information one might find.</font>

  On The Nature of God<br>
  </font></span><font size="3"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light"><br>
  </font><font face="Times New Roman">
  Who is God? God explains in His Final Book that it is quite simply impossible
  for us to completely understand Him. We cannot pinpoint a definition of the
  Creator, &quot;Glory to the Sustainer of the heavens and the earth - the
  Sustainer, in almightiness enthroned - from all that they may attribute to Him
  by way of definition&quot; [43:82]<br>
  Our inability to completely understand God does not mean that He is completely
  remote from us. In spite of our limited understanding, we are all quite
  capable of turning to God, and He is not unaware of our efforts,<br>
  &quot;...and unto thy Sustainer turn with love.&quot; [94:8]<br>
  &quot;Behold, for those who stand in awe of God although He is beyond the
  reach of their perception, there is forgiveness in store and a great
  reward&quot; [67:12]<br>
  <br>
  God has not left mankind entirely in the dark regarding His Nature. He refers
  to Himself by approximately 100 names in various places throughout the Final
  Book. Each name is a descriptive attribute of God, and they are all meant to
  help us understand the Creator. To gain this understanding involves simply
  thinking about God and reflecting on His names and this type of awareness is a
  central pillar of faith (i.e. when one actively remembers God and is conscious
  of Him). A second benefit of these names is that some of them provide mankind
  with ideals to try to attain. For example, since God is the Most Forgiving,
  Most Patient, and Most Knowledgeable, we should each strive to be forgiving,
  patient, and knowledgeable (educated in our case). Of all His attributes, God
  emphasizes a single one above all others in His Final Book: that HE IS ONE.
  God is not two, three, four, or more beings. There is only one deity, and He
  is God, &quot;Say: `He is God, Unique God the Eternal, the Independent. He
  begets not, and neither is He begotten. And there is nothing that could be
  compared to Him.'&quot; [112:1-4]<br>
  <br>
  In other places of the Final Book, God emphasizes His Greatness and the
  impossibility of fully grasping Him by using the plural sense of pronouns for
  Himself - but He is strictly One and Unique with no other partners or deities.<br>
  <br>
  After this aspect of Unity, God chose to emphasize two of His other names more
  often than the rest in the Final Book: &quot;the Most Merciful, the One who
  acts Mercifully.&quot; In fact, each chapter but one in the whole Book starts
  with, &quot;In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the One who Acts
  Mercifully.&quot; These two names cannot be emphasized enough. They are meant
  to stress we should not let our sins keep us from coming back to God and
  calling to Him at all times, in joy or sadness. The Creator is more aware of
  our imperfections than we are, and so when we stumble and feel bad, God is far
  more likely to be kind than angry.<br>
  <br>
  The Last Messenger and Prophet of God (i.e. the person whom God chose to
  deliver the Final Book to the rest of mankind) commented on God's mercy by
  informing us that, &quot;When God decreed the Creation He pledged Himself by
  writing in His book which is laid down with Him: `My mercy prevails over my
  wrath.'&quot; - the Last Messenger<br>
  <br>
  &quot;God says: I am as My servant thinks I am. I am with Him when He makes
  mention of Me. If he makes mention of Me to himself, I make mention of him to
  Myself; and if he makes mention of Me in an assembly, I make mention of him in
  an assembly better than it. And if he draws near to Me a hand's span, I draw
  near to him an arm's length; and if he draws near to Me an arm's length, I
  draw near to him a fathom's length. And if he comes to Me walking, I go to him
  with speed.&quot; - The Last Messenger<br>

  The Nature of Man<br>
  </span></font><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light"><font size="3"><br>
  Who are we, and what makes us different from all other things? We are
  creations of God, along with the rest of the universe. We are human beings,
  all descendants of a common ancestry well known to most of us: Adam and Eve.
  Humanity, however, is distinct from the rest of the universe in a very
  fundamental way according to the Final Book, &quot;Verily, We did offer the
  trust to the heavens and the earth, and the mountains: but they refused to
  bear it because they were afraid of it. Yet man took it up - for verily he has
  always been prone to be most wicked, most foolish.&quot; [33:72]<br>
  Over the years, many scholars of the Book have tried to understand exactly
  what God meant by &quot;the trust&quot;. The most convincing argument (based
  on other parts of the Book and on certain statements of the Last Messenger) is
  that it refers to our ability to make decisions both freely and intelligently.
  In other words, our uniqueness as human beings stems from two gifts given to
  us by God:<br>
  * our ability to freely choose between actions (good and evil)<br>
  * our ability to intelligently weigh and make those choices<br>
  The price of these gifts is a tremendous amount of responsibility on our part;
  the responsibility not to abuse our gifts by rejecting God or by hurting each
  other unnecessarily.<br>
  <br>
  The blessings of these two gifts are immeasurable, especially when God reminds
  us that He could have decided things otherwise by depriving us of either gift,
  &quot;Now had it been Our will [that men should not be able to discern between
  right and wrong], We could surely have deprived them of their sight, so that
  they would stray forever from the [right] way: for how could they have had
  insight [into what is true]? And had it been Our will [that they should not be
  free to choose between right and wrong], We could surely have transformed them
  [rooted] in their places, so that they would not be able to move forward, and
  could not turn back.&quot; [36:66-67]<br>
  However, God did NOT will this, and as a result we are blessed with will and
  reason. The Final Book clearly warns against abusing these blessings, either
  by neglecting ourselves when we don't think wisely, or by hurting others when
  we deny them the right to choose, &quot;Verily, the vilest of all creatures in
  the sight of God are those deaf, those dumb ones who do not use their
  reason.&quot; [8:22]<br>
  <br>
  &quot;There shall be no coercion in matters of faith. Distinct has now become
  the right way from error: hence he who rejects evil and believes in God has
  indeed taken hold of a support most unfailing, which shall never give way: for
  God is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.&quot; [2:256]<br>
  <br>
  In spite of mankind's free will and reason, God warns us in His Book always to
  remember that these gifts are limited after all. The Final Word lies with Him
  in all matters. However, this is not to say that men's destinies are arbitrary
  - not at all. We are able to make decisions that affect our lives, but at the
  same time, God is also making decisions about us and for us,<br>
  &quot;And had thy Sustainer so willed, all those who live on earth would
  surely have attained to faith, all of them: do you then think that you could
  compel people to believe, notwithstanding that no human being can ever attain
  to faith otherwise than by God's leave, and [that] it is He who lays the
  loathsome evil [of disbelief] upon those who will not use their reason.&quot;
  [10:99-100]<br>
  &quot;...Verily, God does not change men's condition unless they change their
  inner selves...&quot; [13:11]</font><br>
  <br>
  </font><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC"><font color="#000080" face="Copperplate Gothic Light">3.
  Free Will and Reason Applied<br>
  </font></span><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light"><font size="3"><br>
  Has God given mankind a clear path to Him? In essence, every rational reader
  would like to know if they can trust the authenticity of the Final Book. It is
  perfectly natural to feel that way; after all, this is the outcome of our
  God-given gift of reason. However, our own skeptical minds are the keys here:
  the Final Book, according to God, is addressed to people, who think, pure and
  simple, &quot;...In this, behold, there are messages indeed for people who
  think.&quot; [39:42]<br>
  &quot;Thus clearly do We spell out these messages unto people who use their
  reason.&quot; [30:28]<br>
  <br>
  No one but God can make a human being believe in the Truth of the Final Book,
  but that human being has to read it with an open mind, applying his or her
  powers of reason. The price of limited free will is that we must choose to be
  guided. Those people who do search for the Truth with an open mind and heart
  may find that the Final Book, while vast, is surprisingly clear, &quot;Nay,
  but this [divine writ] consists of messages self-evident in the breasts of
  those who have been given knowledge - and none could knowingly reject Our
  messages unless it be such as would do wrong [to themselves].&quot; [29:49]<br>
  &quot;This divine writ - let there be no doubt about it - is guidance for all
  the God-conscious...&quot; [2:2]<br>
  <br>
  The guidance of the Final Book is available to anyone who goes in search of
  it, &quot;[O men!] We have now bestowed upon you from on high a divine writ
  containing all that you ought to bear in mind: will you not, then, use your
  reason?&quot; [21:10]<br>
  <br>
  One of the most interesting aspects of the authenticity of the Final Book is
  the quantity of scientifically accurate statements in it - on subjects not
  even dreamed of 1300 years ago. A sample of these includes the following:<br>
  A large explosion marking the start of creation (Big Bang) [21:30]<br>
  The initial smoky (nebulous) nature of the skies [41:11]<br>
  The expansion of the universe [51:41]<br>
  The presence of a huge amount of time before mankind appeared [76:1]<br>
  The existence of sun and moon orbits [21;33]<br>
  The finite sun and moon lifetimes [13:2]<br>
  The final destination of the sun (Solar Apex) [36:38]<br>
  The origin of all life based in water [21:30]<br>
  In fact, God states that the amazing beauty and intricacy of the natural world
  around us, as well as our own complex biological makeup, will ultimately lead
  us to Him as we grow in understanding,<br>
  &quot;In time, We shall make them fully understand Our messages [through what
  they perceive] in the utmost horizons [of the universe] and within themselves,
  so that it will become clear unto them this [revelation] is indeed the truth.
  Is it not enough that thy Sustainer is witness unto everything?&quot; [41:53]<br>
  </font>
  <br>
  </font><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC"><font color="#000080" face="Copperplate Gothic Light">4.
  The Presence of Evil<br>
  </font></span><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light"><br>
  <font size="3">
  Why does God allow men and women to be hurt? There are some people who use the
  presence of suffering and evil in this world as grounds to lose hope and
  perhaps even to reject God. However, according to the Final Book, the limited
  free will and reason of human beings destroys that argument. We are
  responsible for what we do, and must bear the consequences - that is the
  liability or price of freedom. The evil that we do and suffer from is chosen
  by us and not by God, &quot;...God wills no wrong to His creation.&quot;
  [3:108]<br>
  <br>
  However, God also guarantees us that aside from our own evil actions and their
  effects, God Himself will put us through some trials and tribulations here on
  earth - but the key is they will never be more than we can handle, and they
  may even be good for us,<br>
  <br>
  &quot;If misfortune touches you [know that] similar misfortune has touched
  [other] people as well; for it is by turns that We apportion unto men such
  days [of fortune and misfortune]: and [this] to the end that God might mark
  out those who have attained to faith, and choose from among you such as [with
  their lives] bear witness to the truth - since God does not love evildoers -
  and that God might render pure of all dross those who have attained to faith,
  and bring to nought those who deny the truth. Do you think that you could
  enter Paradise unless God takes cognizance of your having striven hard [in His
  cause], and takes cognizance of your being patient in adversity?&quot;
  [3:140-142]<br>
  <br>
  &quot;God does not burden any human being with more than he is well able to
  bear: in his favour shall be whatever good he does, and against him whatever
  evil he does...&quot; [2:286]<br>
  <br>
  An integral part of our being aware of God is hope and patience in times of
  hardship. In fact, the loss of hope is actually one of the symptoms of
  rejection of God,<br>
  &quot;[Prophet Abraham] exclaimed, `and who - other than those who have
  utterly lost their way - could ever abandon the hope of his Sustainers
  grace?'&quot; [15:56]<br>
  <br>
  The greatest source of hope is that God shall allow those people who accept
  Him to enter Paradise and, more importantly, to be close to Him. The Final
  Book contains many references on Paradise, and also on Hell, the destination
  of those people who knowingly reject God. Paradise is quite literally a place
  of indescribable joy; whereas Hell is its indescribable opposite (both places
  are given only partial descriptions in the Book). While the inhabitants of
  Paradise are permanent dwellers, the inmates of Hell are not necessarily
  imprisoned there forever; there are some, who shall ultimately be freed,
  &quot;[But] verily, as for those who attain to faith and do righteous deeds -
  the gardens of Paradise will be there to welcome them; therein will they
  abide, [and] never will they desire any change there from.&quot; [18:107-108]<br>
  <br>
  &quot;And whoever rebels against God and His Apostle and transgresses His
  bounds, him will He commit unto fire, therein to abide; and shameful suffering
  awaits him.&quot; [4:14]<br>
  <br>
  &quot;There shall come out of Hell-fire he who has said `There is no deity
  except God' and who has in his heart goodness weighing a barley-corn; then
  there shall come out of Hell-fire he who has said `There is no deity except
  God' and who has in his heart goodness weighing a grain of wheat; then there
  shall come out of Hell-fire he who has said `There is no deity except God' and
  who has in his heart goodness weighing an atom.&quot; - The Last Messenger<br>

  This Life and the Next<br>
  </font></span><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light"><br>
  <font size="3">
  What is the end to men's lives? There are two parts to men's lives: the part
  here on earth, and the part in the Hereafter. The dividing line between the
  two is known as death, followed by the Day of Judgment or Resurrection. As far
  as death is concerned, everyone must go through it, but on Judgment Day people
  will be sorted out from each other into different categories,<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Every human being is bound to taste death: but only on the Day of
  Resurrection will you be requited in full [for what you have done]...&quot;
  [3:185]<br>
  Resurrection Day will actually be a huge period of time (not a regular 24-hour
  day) in which every single human will be resurrected and judged by God on his
  or her beliefs and deeds. No human being - not even any Prophet - knows when
  this Day will come, for this is knowledge known only to God. The Final Book
  does describe it in several passages as a giant disaster on many scales
  (physical and ecological among others), and the Last Messenger was told of
  some of its foreshadowing signs which he communicated to us.<br>
  </font>
  <br>
  </font><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC"><font color="#000080" face="Copperplate Gothic Light">6.
  Messengers and Prophets<br>
  </font></span><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light"><font size="3"><br>
  Who delivered God's Message to mankind? God has sent us many `reminders' of
  Him and of our obligations to Him over the centuries, culminating in the Final
  Book almost 1400 years ago. Every one of those `reminders' was delivered to us
  via a selected human being, one who was strong enough to deliver God's message
  to his people. These human beings are called the Prophets. They were not
  supernatural or immortal or different in any way from other human beings
  except that they were entrusted by God to speak in His Name,<br>
  &quot;For [even] before thy time, [O Prophet], we never sent [as our
  messengers] any but [mortal] men, whom We inspired - hence [tell the deniers
  of the truth] `If you do not know this, ask the followers of earlier
  revelation' - and neither did We endow them with bodies that ate no food, nor
  were they immortal.&quot; [21:7-8]<br>
  <br>
  Some of the Prophets were allowed to perform supernatural miracles but only
  with God's permission (i.e. if He willed it). However, the Final Book stresses
  that every Prophet is no more than a servant of God - they do not have a share
  in His Divinity.<br>
  <br>
  There is also a small group of Prophets who were also Messengers. Every
  Prophet has called his people to the Truth, but Messengers were additionally
  given a rejuvenated Message from God to convey. Every Messenger is a Prophet,
  but not every Prophet is a Messenger. There have been many Prophets, of which
  here are the names of a few mentioned in the Book: Adam, Noah, Abraham, Lot,
  Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Elijah, Elias, David, Solomon,
  Jonah, Job, Zacharias, John, Jesus, and, of course, the Last Messenger.</font><br>
  <br>
  </font><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC"><font color="#000080" face="Copperplate Gothic Light">7.
  Eternal Salvation<br>
  </font></span><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light"><font size="3"><br>
  Are certain people arbitrarily guaranteed the Favor of God, while others are
  excluded? The Mercy of God is not restricted arbitrarily to any one person.
  Everyone and anyone is free to accept the path to God using their own free
  will and reason,<br>
  <br>
  &quot;And they claim, `None shall ever enter Paradise unless he be a Jew' - or
  `a Christian'. Such are their wishful beliefs! Say [to them, O Prophet]:
  `Produce an evidence for what you are claiming, if what you say is true!' Yea,
  indeed: everyone who surrenders his whole being unto God, and is a doer of
  good, shall have his reward with his Sustainer, and all such need have no
  fear, and neither shall they grieve.&quot; [2:111-112]<br>
  <br>
  The consequence of this is responsibility - everyone will be held accountable
  on the Day of Judgement. Some of us may be uncomfortable with this, but it is
  simply the price of freedom,<br>
  &quot;It may not accord with your wishful thinking - nor with the wishful
  thinking of the followers of earlier revelation - [that] he who does evil
  shall be requited for it, and shall find none to protect him from God, and
  none to bring him succour, whereas anyone - be it man or woman - who does good
  deeds and is a believer, shall enter paradise, and shall not be wronged by as
  much as [would fill] the groove of a date-stone.&quot; [4:123-124]<br>
  </font>
  <br>
  </font><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC"><font color="#000080" face="Copperplate Gothic Light">8.
  Forgiveness of God<br>
  </font></span><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light"><font size="3"><br>
  If we sin, what should we expect from God? If we subsequently feel guilty and
  repent after doing something evil, God wants us to expect Him to be forgiving,
  forgiving, and more forgiving. However, there is one sin which God will not
  forgive: worshipping anything besides Him (unless the person realizes his or
  her error and returns to worshipping the One God),<br>
  &quot;Verily God does not forgive the ascribing of divinity to anything beside
  Him, although He forgives any lesser sin to whomever He wills: for he who
  ascribes divinity to anything beside God has indeed contrived an awesome
  sin.&quot; [4:48]<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Say, `O you servants of Mine who have transgressed against your own
  selves! Despair not of God's Mercy: behold, God forgives all sins - for
  verily, He alone is much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace.'&quot; [39:53]<br>
  <br>
  Again, the most common phrase in the Final Book is &quot;In the Name of God,
  the Most Merciful, the One who Acts Mercifully.&quot; The Last Messenger
  commented on God's forgiveness on many occasions as in the following case,<br>
  <br>
  &quot;God has said, `O son of Adam, so long as you call upon Me and ask of Me,
  I shall forgive you for what you have done, and I shall not mind. O son of
  Adam, were your sins to reach the clouds of the sky and were you then to ask
  forgiveness of Me, I would forgive you. O son of Adam, were you to come to Me
  with sins nearly as great as the earth and were you then to face Me, ascribing
  no partner to Me, I would bring you forgiveness nearly as great as it [i.e.
  the earth]'&quot;. - The Last Messenger<br>

  The Straight Way<br>
  </font></span><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light" size="3"><br>
  What is the name for the way of life described in the Final Book? It is Islam,
  and it means &quot;self-surrender [to God]&quot;. Any man or woman who accepts
  Islam is a Muslim. The Final Book is called the Qur'an (meaning &quot;the
  Recitation&quot;), and it is addressed to all of mankind in spite of being
  revealed in Arabic, the language of its Messenger and his people: Muhammad bin
  Abd-Allah. The life of the Prophet serves as the other base of Islam (the
  first being the Qur'an), and it is known as the Sunnah. Muhammad is the Last
  Prophet and Messenger of God as the Qur'an says,<br>
  &quot;[And know, O believers, that] Muhammad is not the father of any one of
  your men, but is God's Apostle and the Seal of all the Prophets...&quot;
  [33:40]<br>
  And God has revealed to us His proper name, and it is ALLAH.<br>
  <br>
  The Qur'an contains a great deal of guidance and information for anyone
  looking for final answers. The information given in this small essay is only
  the tip of the tip of the iceberg. There is no substitute for reading the
  Qur'an itself in its entirety - it is the closest we can come to having God
  speak to us directly and personally here on Earth. The Qur'an answers many
  questions which are commonly asked by today's men and women. Its scope is
  wide: from fundamental issues such as the nature of the Creator and mankind's
  limited free will and reason, to the more mundane such as marriage laws and
  whom to give charity to. Islam as described in the Qur'an is vastly and almost
  completely different than Islam as understood by most non-Muslims and even a
  few Muslims. The negative image of Islam today is an incredibly misleading
  deception. It is based on the moral weakness of some people who claim to be
  Muslims, and also on the unawareness of non-Muslims. Behind this image is the
  presence of a Truth which answers the fundamental questions we have, and which
  can reunite us with God. It is there for us to listen to, or to ignore.<br>
  And Allah Knows Best.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;And [know that] We have not created the heavens and the earth and all
  that is between them in mere idle play...&quot; [21:16]<br>
  &quot;Will they not, then, try to understand this Qur'an? Had it issued from
  any but God, they would surely have found in it many an inner
  contradiction!&quot; [4:82]<br>
  <br>
  &quot;We did not bestow the Qur'an on thee from on high to make thee
  unhappy.&quot; [20:2]<br>
  <br>
  &quot;[O men!] We have now bestowed upon you from on high a divine writ
  containing all that you ought to bear in mind: will you not, then, use your
  reason?&quot; [21:10]<br>
  <br>
  &quot;...so remember Me, and I shall remember you; and be grateful to Me, and
  deny Me not.&quot; [2:152]<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Verily, those who attain to faith and do righteous deeds will the Most
  Gracious endow with love.&quot; [19:96]<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Say [O Prophet]: `If you love God, follow Me, [and] God will love you
  and forgive you your sins; for God is much-forgiving, a dispenser of
  grace.'&quot; [3:31]<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Say: `If all the sea were ink for my Sustainers words, the sea would
  indeed be exhausted ere my Sustainers words are exhausted! And [thus it would
  be] if we were to add to it sea upon sea.'&quot; [18:109]<br>
