From the Jerry DiPaola article:   Steelers running back Jerome Bettis missed
practice Wednesday, and later said he might not need to play in the final
two regular-season games to be ready for the first playoff game Jan. 19 or
20.

Bettis has missed the past three games with a serious groin injury that he
described to David Letterman last week as "like splitting your pants, but
you're splitting your body."

"Do you need to (play)? Need is a strong word," Bettis said yesterday after
watching his teammates practice. "Would you like to get a little work in?
Just a little bit, nothing strenuous. But you would like to get a little
work in if you could.

"But if you can't, I don't think it precludes you from playing (in the
playoffs)."

Bettis said that he didn't know if he would practice today or play Sunday in
Cincinnati, but he will base his availability on how he feels.

"You want to take care of the injury first and if that means not playing,
that means not playing," he said. "But you want to make sure you're healed
up. The team playing as well as it has played allows me the opportunity to
get healthy. I'm using it very, very wisely.

"What I do know is if you don't play, there is going to be a certain amount
of rust associated with not having played. The key is to minimize the rust.
This is nine years in. I'm not going to miss much."

************  Our View  ****************

Pretty much sums it up right there.   Clearly, Bettis is a large risk here.
Stay tuned to see how he progresses but even if he were to start, there's
always that very real risk that he'd pull himself out if he felt a twinge.

Thanks to Footballguy Greg Lizotte for pointing me to this one.

Joe
