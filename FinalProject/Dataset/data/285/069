<DIV class=ar>CHOWCHILLA, Calif., June 29 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Global 
Diversified Industries, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: <A 
href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=gdvi.ob&amp;d=t">GDVI</A> - <A 
href="http://www.zinester.com/lr/204725/4952643">News</A>), focused on the modular 
building industry with emphasis on the education market, today issued the 
following letter to its stockholders: 
<P>Dear Fellow Stockholders: 
<P>We at Global Diversified Industries are very proud of the achievements, and 
growth of the Company, in its first two years. Our revenues should top $10 
million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2005, and we will be profitable. 
That compares to revenues of $3.8 million the previous year. During the year 
ended April 30, 2005, we were under contract with 30 different California School 
Districts. We are very proud of our accomplishments for a Company this young. 
<P>Your Company constructs modular buildings, including single and two-story 
classrooms, computer and science laboratories, childcare facilities, libraries, 
administrative offices or even entire schools, for the education market in 
California. Someday we will expand well beyond that description. But we are 
focused like a laser on this market now for two very good reasons. The 
opportunities are excellent since, with passage of California Proposition 55, 
$12.3 billion is being made available to school systems to build long overdue 
projects. School systems turn to us, rather than traditional construction 
companies, because we are more cost effective and their buildings will be ready 
much more quickly. The second reason for our optimism is that, basically because 
of unfortunate circumstances, two of our largest former California competitors 
have closed their doors. We believe the moment is now to capitalize on this 
opportunity. 
<P>Global Diversified has grown to 150 employees, most based at our 100,000 
square foot manufacturing facility on 16 acres in Chowchilla in central 
California. From there, with excellent freeway systems, we can competitively 
serve both the southern and northern California markets. During the year we 
added two assembly lines, we now have four, and acquired steel fabrication 
equipment that improves our product efficiency and reduces costs. Our management 
team is well versed in this industry, with more than 120 years of combined 
successful modular industry experience. Our subsidiary, MBS Construction, Buena 
Park, a full service provider of construction services, has increased its field 
construction crews to 10 and just completed its first $1 million site 
construction project. 
<P>In the area of marketing, we have developed a new website at <A 
href="http://www.zinester.com/lr/204727/4952643">http://www.gdvi.net</A> and hired two veteran sales 
people. We have also developed new Company literature which is being mailed to 
our stockholders as part of our campaign to better explain our Company, and its 
successes, to the investment community. 
<P>Why are we so bullish about our chances of continued success? As a 
stockholder, you should know that 73 percent of California classrooms are more 
than 25 years old and one million students here attend schools with bathrooms 
that don't work. It is estimated that nearly 1,000 California campuses are 
critically overcrowded, exceeding by 200 to 300 percent state density 
guidelines. California has the third most overcrowded schools in the nation and 
students simply don't do as well in such a facility, according to experts who 
have studied this crisis. That is why California is moving forward to solve this 
problem. 
<P><PRE>    As a stockholder, you should be aware of our goals.  These include:

     * Doubling revenues over the next two fiscal years, from $20 million
       projected for the 2006 fiscal year, to our goal of $40 million in 2007.
       The Company will also grow through strategic acquisitions both inside
       and outside California.

     * Achieving profits of $2 million in fiscal year 2006 and $4 million the
       following year.  We will add sales people as part of this effort.

     * Adding another assembly line, expanding the factory to increase plant
       production capacity, acquiring a larger facility for our MBS subsidiary
       and entering the commercial market with "New Generation Products."
</PRE>
<P>I am very proud of what we have built in a short period of time and very 
pleased with my fellow stockholders who have remained loyal to our endeavors. We 
are working for you. 
<P><PRE>    Sincerely,

    Phil Hamilton, Chairman and CEO
    Global Diversified Industries, Inc.
