new brand today as NEX2U(TM) (CDTD). The decision to create the new brand

strategy that was unveiled thiss w e e k at the 22nd Annual Catalog 
Conference at the Gaylord Palms in Kissimmee, FL. Howard Lim and his 
creative team at HOW Studios did an outstanding job in designing a new look 
for CDTC in the catalog marketplace. 

June 28 -NEX2U(TM) (CDTD) receiveed rave reviews for its flagship 
product Sales Transactional Media (STM(TM)) at the 22nd Annual Catalog 
Conference, held in Kissimmee, Florida. 

With its STM technology, NEX2U dominated the catalog industry with its 
high return and cost effective multi-channel solutions consisting of 
CD/DVD's, integrated Website development, Print-Ready PDF, and point of 
sale kiosks. STM allows companies to 0ffer a seamless online/offline

The results of several international studies performed for the

discussions with three European marketing companies to distribute our 
products. The event reinforced the value that our products bring to the 
industry."
