Per our discussions yesterday, I did find an Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P. Order On Rehearing in my file, dated August 5, 1997 in Docket No. RP97-126-002 (80 FERC P61,199) concerning scheduling alt FT by price.  On reviewing it again, some key points were:  

	Allocate based on the highest percentage of the maximum rate - the rate used being the rate for the package of services that includes those secondary rights.
	The Commission maintains that all firm capacity, once scheduled, be curtailed pro rata, without regard to price.

Panhandle also filed on March 14, 1997 for scheduling alt FT by price at Docket No. RP97-291 (it's referenced in footnotes, but I don't have a copy of the filing).
