My mom said the only reason men are alive is for lawn care and vehicle maintenance.  -Tim Allen 

We have women in the military, but they don't put us in the front lines. They don't know if we can fight, if we can kill. I think we can.  All the general has to do is walk over to the women and say, "You see the enemy over there? They say you look fat in those uniforms."  -Elayne Boosler

Electricity can be dangerous. My nephew tried to stick a penny into a plug.  Whoever said a penny doesn't go far didn't see him shoot across that floor. I told him he was grounded.  -Tim Allen 

If you can't beat them, arrange to have them beaten.  -George Carlin 

I am a marvelous housekeeper. Every time I leave a man I keep his house. -Zsa Zsa Gabor 

The problem with the designated driver program, is that it's not a desirable job. But if you ever get sucked into doing it, have fun with it.  At the end of the night, drop them off at the wrong house.  -Jeff Foxworthy
