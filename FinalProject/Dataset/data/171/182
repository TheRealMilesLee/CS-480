<DIV class=ar>HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., April 1, 2005 (PRIMEZONE) -- Quintek 
Technologies, Inc. (OTC BB:<A 
href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=qtek.ob">QTEK.OB</A> - <A 
href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/h?s=qtek.ob">News</A>), a provider of 
21st-century Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and document-management services 
that raise efficiency and lower costs for data-intensive industries, announced 
today that it has commenced billable work under an extensive three-year services 
agreement with a national provider of document solutions and business services. 
<P>Quintek executed a subcontractor agreement with the document solutions 
company in May 2004. Over the past 9 months Quintek has aided that primary 
contractor in providing key BPO services for a number of customers under this 
agreement. The newest contract represents the first multi-year statement of work 
with a multi-billion-dollar customer under this agreement. The end-user of the 
services is a global medical company with revenues that exceed $10 billion 
annually. 
<P>``This contract demonstrates the success of Quintek's strategy to team 
effectively with partners to enable them to rapidly expand their business,'' 
said Robert Steele, CEO of Quintek. ``Our ability to provide core services 
alongside our partners in a teaming capability continues to prove to be a 
valuable resource and to accelerate Quintek's growth. We have already jointly 
identified numerous additional jobs and are pursuing similarly beneficial 
results.'' 
<P>Due to competitive reasons and contractual obligations Quintek is not 
permitted to publicly disclose the customer's or the end user's name.
