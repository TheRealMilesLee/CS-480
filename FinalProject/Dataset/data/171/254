the customer to make VoIP-enabled ca|ls from any telephone, not just 
one physically connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may cal| their Personal Gateway from any ce||u|ar or landline push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP call savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partially or entirely the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
te|ecommunication providers.

contractual 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 200,OO0 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatema|a in 2005. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi||iOn USD and Yap International expects that its 
products will comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exc|usive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 2005, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team,

Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Milliken GMBH
