Elizabeth,

I assume that there must be some publically available documents which describe the auction process and the structure of compliant bids.

I would like to obtain a copy of such documents, as they may provide some insight into what the deal structure might look like and help us to prepare NETCoOnline for as quick a relaunch as possible.

Do you know where I might obtain copies of such documents?

Dave
