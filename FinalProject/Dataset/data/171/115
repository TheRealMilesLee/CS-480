The E&Y representatives (for the Creditors Committee) will be back in the office tomorrow (Wednesday) morning.  They want to continue to learn about how we conduct our business and may want to pay particular attention to how we value transactions in deciding termination amounts.  This has really gone beyond what the lawyers can effectively coordinate.  Bill Bradford suggested that Berney Aucoin might be a good resource for this process to assist Fallon and Miller since he really understands how we do deals from front to back and knows who all the right people are to speak to various issues.  If you agree, would you ask Berney to focus on this?  He can give me a call in the a.m.
