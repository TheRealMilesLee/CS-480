Dear All,

	There is a new PortCalc PRODFIX ( v4.2.2.1 ) which can handle the Bankruptcy Portfolios, please use that one instead. ( The Stage one has some performance problems to be resolved.)

	/prod/egs-home/ermt/bin/pwrcalc_slr.new

	Sorry for the inconveniences.

	Regards,


Norman.

Can you please work on attaching the portcalc code to the Bankruptcy Portfolios first thing Monday morning.  Please reply to this e-mail when it is complete so we can begin testing the transactions we moved.

Thanks,
Stacey

P.S.  Zhiyun, Thank you so much for the option data.

Stacey
