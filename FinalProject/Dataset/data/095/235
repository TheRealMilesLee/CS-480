Autumn Intrigue
Calyx & Corolla Style

Dear Tracy Geaccone, 

Selecting the right gift or seasonal accent to adorn your home
or office is made easy with our original bouquets, orchids and
preserved designs. Each of these intriguing items has its own
character and ambience and is meant to complement the good life.

Take our Orchid Blaze Bouquet for example. With its fiery orange
orchids and black matte vase, it makes the perfect seasonal
centerpiece. This eye-catching bouquet is easy to arrange too.

The Colmanara Orchid Plant is quite possibly the most exciting
new orchid to be introduced in the last decade. This alluring
orchid, nicknamed "Wildcat" is diligently sought-after for its
long lasting blooms.

Our Antiqued Holiday Wreath is a preserved design whose color
scheme works with most decors. It is available with our brass
wreath hanger, making it a breeze to display. And don't forget
the ideal autumn birthday gift!

The Golden Harvest Roses bouquet is sure to add special meaning
to a wonderful occasion.
