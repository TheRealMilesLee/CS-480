The spot was terrific and exhibited high professionalism.  We were the main feature and Judi was great.  Thank you Judi for telling the "great" stories--and in sound bites!  A clip of Laura Bush with a voice-over telling about her involvement with the Dallas room and the growth to 84 rooms in the State followed.  Next, the two newscasters introduced their own bears they were donating to BEAR and offered viewers the opportunity to phone their station's special number (and Lori got three calls, too, within minutes of the airing) or to log onto Good News.com for more info from Channel 2.  Next,the children from St. John's school were featured as they entered the museum holding their donated bears high (no school uniforms could be seen).  The SJS students were then featured sitting in rows at the IMAX  and the voice-over explained the "deal" at the Museum of Natural Science.  I was thoroughly pleased and know Judy Hay will obtain multiple copies of the show for us! 
 
 Judy, let me know if I can get a tape and make copies when I am over at Murworth seeing George next Thursday/Friday.  Have a great weekend, all.  (And the Director search has not produced the perfect candidate this week.)  Linda Hunsaker
