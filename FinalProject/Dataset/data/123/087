Perhaps I should rephrase.  Do you wish for any work to continue on the ROC at this time, or shall we put it on the back burner for a couple of weeks?  If the ROC is to be operational in early 2002, any further efforts towards the project will begin to incur external costs.

Lloyd and Fred are working on a management briefing for you.

Absolutely not.

We never did this on any of the other stuff.

Louise, 
Do you want Lloyd and Fred to obtain construction drawings (CD's) so that a project estimate can be generated on the ROC?  The CD's will run between $25 - 45,000.

Thanks,
Tammy
