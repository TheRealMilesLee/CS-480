Hi Sara,

There were two options terminated on the same date. I faxed you one of the two. The content was my concern.

Thanks for your feedback.

Enjoy your weekend!

Jorge

Jorge:

Please read paragraph 2 of the Termination confirmation.

It refers to the terminated transaction having "Reference number 1980816".

The confirmation that you  sent to me (for the terminated transaction) has a Reference number 1980815.  The termination confirmation is referenced as 1980816.

You need to correct paragraph 2 of the Termination confirmation. Then the document can be executed.

Please let me know if you have further questions.
