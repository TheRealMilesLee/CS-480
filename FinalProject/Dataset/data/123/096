As part of our 3d quarter exercise we terminated retainer relationships with Goodin McBride and McMullen Strategic Group.  

For the West, we have the following retainers remaining.  

Governmental Advocates, Lobbyist, California
Lang Hanson--Lobbyist, California
Mark Greenberg--Lobbyist, Washington
Dan Douglas--counsel on Tariff Advice review, California

I don't have copies of all the retainer letters, but they all expire at the close of 2001.    

Re:  2002.
Jeff D. and I are talking with our California lobbyists on Monday.
I've talked with Mark Greenberg.
I've asked Sue Mara to touch base with Dan Douglas.

Under separate cover, Sue Mara reported the state of the retainers for AReM.
