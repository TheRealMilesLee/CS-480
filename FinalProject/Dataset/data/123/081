Ed,

I've been trying to reach you all day but am not surprised I haven't been
able to reach you.  I understand that Enron is offering netting agreements
to its counterparties.  Con Edison Energy would like to get a copy of such
agreement for review and possible implementation. The might go along way for
booking out existing trades and enable us to execute additional transactions
with Enron.   I would appreciate if you or someone at Enron could email me a
copy of the netting agreement ASAP.  

Best Regards,

Herb Miller
