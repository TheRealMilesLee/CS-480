Sung to "Those were the Days" from All in the Family...

Only hung with wealthy friends
Had the new Mercedes Benz
Means were justified by ends
Those were the days

Andy Fastow's Porsche was neat
With LJM it's off the balance sheet
We sure were loved by the Street
Those were the days

And you knew who you were then
Down the hall, my new girlfriend
Brother we could use a man like Jeffrey Skilling again

Didn't need no SEC
All my calls deep in money
Used to drink with Delaney
Those were the days.
