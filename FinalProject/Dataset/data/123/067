I know but... this name is not simple to spell or remember.   His name is Paul Y'Barbo.

It will be very beneficial if you could come up with the names.

Jean,
What are the names for the new persons? It makes it easier to know up front so we can have the tech dispatch the equipment.

This will probably be under $500. Can you add this to another order?

Karon -- How about you order a 2 extra of the standard dual video cards and charge to 179002.go.mkgt code... that way I'll always have some ready since they are so hard to get in a timely manner.  ????
 
Larry/Scott -- any objections?
