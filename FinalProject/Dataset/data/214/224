Hi Teb!

The time is approaching, isn't it? Time to start thinking of 
flowers, candy -- and getting in touch with old friends.

Take a look at your new Classmates -- from school, 
college or the military -- and see if someone out there 
might be waiting for a Valentine's hello from you!

Find your new Classmates now!
