Chris:
 
The reason for the variaces is that you are adding up the daily P&L for 12/3, 12/4, and 12/31 and trying to reconciile with MTD P&L as of 12/31.  However, please note that we produced the 12/31 P&L (i.e. west pwrdpr1231) treating 12/31 as the only calc/trading day in Dec 01', meaning that you should no longer be looking at 12/3 and 12/4 P&L and counting them as part of the MTD P&L anymore.
 
In short, our dpr for 12/31 should have the same Daily and MTD P&L.  Therefore, the "output" column in the attached spreadsheet is wrong since it's adding up daily P&L for 12/3, 12/4, and 12/31.
 
* I checked the east desk's P&L and believe we all did the same thing, i.e. treating 12/31 as the only trading/calc day in Dec.  You shall observe similar variances in the reconciliation for their dpr for 12/31 as well.
 
Please let me know if you have further questions.
 
Thanks,
 
Fran

I found a couple of discrepancies in the DPR.  Please refer to the attached spreadsheets and let me know where we might be out.
