Debra,

Same list as previous email.  This one has TPs on "East no Duplicates" tab that are not on your master list highlited in yellow.  I don't know of any other transmission lists.

Reagan,

Thank you for the heads up.  So far the agreements I have discussed with the TP's sound like blanket agreements for firm and non-firm transmission.  Once I get my hands on the paperwork, I would like to review each TP with the group to make sure we are covered for all services we will require.

Debra,

As I continue to look through these lists, it is apparent that there are potentially more than one agreement with the TPs.  For example:
point to point
firm
non-firm
short term firm
non-firm
etc....

I am not up to speed on all the different blanket trans agreements we might need or are available.  It seems they all are a bit differently named but fall into similiar transmission classes??  I noticed the Agreement Required column, and it does indicate multiple agreements.  Just want to make sure we don't miss one with a TP.
