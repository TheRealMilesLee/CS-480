Unless I hear otherwise by late today, I will assume that your executive manager has reviewed and approved your section.  Please call if that is not the case. We will make a distribution of the book late today.  We expect additional information from Rex Rogers and possible changes to the information provided by Tim Despain and Rick Carson.  Again, thank you.
