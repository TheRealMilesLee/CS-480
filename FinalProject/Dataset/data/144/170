Peter,

Be assured that I am extremely sensitive to the issues affecting board members in Canada.  We also have similar issues in the UK.  We will endeavor to communicate as best we can.  However, all behavior with respect to your concerns must be practical in light of Enron's cash management systems.  We cannot always hold a board of directors meeting in order to effect a wire transfer.  I am choosing not to interpret your memo as some sort of threat, but as an effort to highlight a reasonable concern.

Regards,

Ray Bowen

For similar reasons, no funds are to be withdrawn in the future from any of the bank accounts of Enron Energy Services Canada Corp. or Enron Direct Canada Corp. without first obtaining the consent of Dave Delainey, Rob Milnthorp and me, who are the Directors of those two companies.
