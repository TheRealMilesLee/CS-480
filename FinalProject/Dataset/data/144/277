<!-- TextStart -->
<p>HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 20, 2001--In a class-action lawsuit
filed today in U.S. District Court, employees of Enron Corp.
(NYSE:<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ene&d=t">ENE</a> - <a href=http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/ene.html>news</a>) claim the company recklessly endangered their retirement
funds, causing some employees to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars
almost overnight.
<p>The suit also claims that after a surprising third quarter loss
announcement, Enron illegally locked down employee retirement plans,
making it impossible for employees to protect their already damaged
retirement funds from a 70 percent drop in Enron stock price.
<p>Filed by attorney Steve Berman of the Seattle-based law firm
Hagens Berman on behalf of a proposed class of participants in the
Enron Stock Plan, the suit claims Enron retirement plan managers
withheld crucial information on the risks of investing in Enron stock.
Instead of being warned of the risks, employees were encouraged to
invest heavily in Enron stock, according to the suit.
<p>Named plaintiff Roy Rinard, a long-time employee, had more than
$470,000 in his retirement savings, much of it invested in Enron stock
on the advice of Enron plan administrators. Now his retirement fund is
worth just $70,000 -- a loss of $400,000 in a little more than a
month.
<p>``I feel like I have been betrayed,'' said Rinard. ``I have lost my
savings, my plans for the future, everything.''
<p>On Oct. 17, Enron locked down employee 401(k) accounts, preventing
employees from moving any of their investments out of Enron stock.
Since then, employees have watched in horror as the company's stock
plunged more than 70 percent after an announcement of a $618 million
third quarter loss.
<p>According to the suit, Enron executives engaged in extensive
insider trading prior to the Oct. 16 announcement, gaining millions of
dollars in personal proceeds.
<p>The class-action suit seeks to represent as many as 21,000
employees who invested in the Enron Stock Plan between Jan. 20, 1998
and Nov. 20, 2001.
<p>On October 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market when it announced
that the company was taking non-recurring charges totaling $1.01
billion after-tax in the third quarter of 2001. Enron later revealed
that a portion of the charge was related to the unwinding of
investments with certain limited partnerships controlled by Enron's
CFO, and the company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in
shareholder equity as a result of the unwinding of investments. As
this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron
common stock dropped significantly.
