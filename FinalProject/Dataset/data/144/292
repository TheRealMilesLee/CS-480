Dear Greg

We met some time ago for dinner in London together with Bruce Farmer.
Since a lot of things at Enron are fluid at the moment I wanted to contact
you to express Glencore's interest to acquire Enron's copper concentrates
and metal book if this is an option Enron would consider.
We understand that the staff in London responsible for these areas are
working on a MBO and there is thus little interest from their side to be
open or co-operative. This is the reason why I contact you directly and
would appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

regards

Paul Wyler
executive director
