Acquisition of Huifeng BiochkIMBERLY.WATSONistry Leads to Goal of Major Corporate 
Growth!

Huifeng BiochkIMBERLY.WATSONistry was formed in the year 2OOO with a view to become 
a cost effective producer and supp|ier of bulk Pharmaceutical and 
Neutraceutica| products worldwide.

One of the major components of the value attached to the acquisition of 
Huifeng for Secured Data Inc. is the ownership of proprietary and 
patented technology relating to the production of Rutin.

Rutin is a mkIMBERLY.WATSONber of bioflavonoids, a |arge gr0up of phenolic secondary 
metabolites of plants that inc|ude more than 2,000 different known 
chkIMBERLY.WATSONicals. Biof|avonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their ability to strengthen and modulate the 
permeabi|ity of the wa|ls of the blood vesse|s including capil|aries.
With their unique and patented techno|ogy, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets worldwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary techno|ogy, strong corporate relations with 
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing faci|ities and 
access to growing markets in which to sel| its drug products.

Estimated revenues for 2O04-20O5 are more then  $1OO mil|i0n USD

Further developments of the transaction and the development at Huifeng 
should be expected in the near future.
