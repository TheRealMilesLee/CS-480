********************************************


Terrorists Multiplying In The Southeast


The governors of Alabama, Georgia & Mississippi would
like to announce that they have made a disturbing discovery in their
states. Apparently, a small number of terrorists have become romantically
involved with the locals.

The result was not pretty, and we now have the sad
task of reporting a new sector of the human race: ISLAMABUBBAS. So far,
only a smattering of actual births has been reported, and we are hard at
work trying to isolate and seal them off.

To date, we have identified the following:
Mohammed Billy Bob Abba Bubba
Mohammed Jethro Bin Thinkin Bout It
Mohammed Forrest Gumpa Bubba
Mohammed Rubba Dub Dubba Bubba
Bobbie Joe Bubba Charlene Atat
Betty Jean Hasbeena Badgurl
Cleavie Daba Hava Tampa
Linda Sue Bin There Dunthat

Not surprisingly, they all seem to have sprung from one couple:
Mohammed Whoozyadaddy and Yomamma Bin Lovin.

We'll keep you posted.
