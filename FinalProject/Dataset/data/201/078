Dear icruise member, 
I recently wrote you about our exciting new product, the icruise.com credit card! Today, I wanted to announce an additional enhancement that will make the icruise.com card "your card of choice". For a limited time only, you can now receive a 0% annual percentage rate (APR) for all purchases, cash advances and BALANCE TRANSFERS! Of course you will also receive icruiseMiles, usable towards the purchase of a cruise from icruise.com on up to ELEVEN different cruise lines. Add to that, No Annual Fee, No Blackout Dates and a credit line up to $100,000 and you have a credit card that really works for you! We will even give you 3,000 icruiseMiles FREE after first use of the card. Click here to apply now! <http://credit.i-cruise.com>
