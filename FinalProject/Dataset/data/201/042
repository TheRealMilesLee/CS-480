Gentlemen,

Brian and I just spoke with Trevor M of Bridgeline about their need for cash.  One idea that we discussed is (i) quickly determine the over-secured portion of the 1.9 Bcf in storage, (ii) allow ENA to sell that gas thereby releasing some of the storage capacity, and (iii) allow Bridgeline to sell the remaining storage capacity (to bring cash in the door and to mitigate the estate's liability) until we decide what to do (i.e. accept or reject).  Let's talk about this tomorrow.

Stuart
