executed contracts of this company (NLNG) during the previous military re=
gime,
since the inception of democracy in Nigeria and carefully uncover  and 
mapped out a  whooping sum USD $28.5m  which we want to transfer to your
account as the beneficiary. It might interest you to know that beginning
of this current civilian government at a working asset capital of USD 3bi=
llion
and will definitely gulp more USD 2 billion on the completion of the fift=
y
part. You can authentically apply for supply if it interests you to be ou=
r
client with full guarantee from me. 

The money $28.5m has been approved for payment by this company NLNG, the
Federal Ministry ofFinance (endorsed by the Accountant General of the Fed=

partner and will regularize  and update the approvals to reflect you as
true beneficiary of the contract  sum USD$28.5m                        
                                      
(TWENTY EIGHT MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS).   
 
Moreover, it is pertinent to note that it is not risky and does not requi=
re
much engagements since we have taken care of the deal in full capacity.

We have resolved to give you 25% of the total sum for your assistance. If=

you are interested in this deal, please contact me through my email. Addr=
ess
above for more likely information. 

Remember to give me your phone number and your fax lines through which I
can send you approved document for your perusal.
