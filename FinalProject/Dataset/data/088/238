Hi John, 
 
I was not aware you had to travel, so I did not have anyone call the people I listed for you.  
 
Is there anyway you can call them over the weekend or later today?
 
If not, I will arrange another interviewer.
 
Thanks!
 
Adrianne

Adrianne,
I was not able to participate in a phone screen for any of the applicants below,  due to business travel. 
What is the latest on this?
