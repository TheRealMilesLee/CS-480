On Thursday, October 18th, Jim McGreevey will once again show New Jerseyans 
why he is the right choice for Governor.

The third debate between McGreevey and Schundler is set for Thursday night, 
at 8:00 on Channel 8 (CN8). It will take place at Rowan University and will 
be televised live.

After the debate, you can show your support for Jim McGreevey.  Here are 
three things you can do:

1.  Immediately after the debate on CN8, from 9:00-10:00 pm, call into "It's 
Your Call With Lynn Doyle." The topic of the show will be the debates. 
1-877-268-5483.

2.  Check the CN8 website as they will probably have a daily poll asking 
viewers which candidate won the debate. www.cn8.com

3.  Listen to the radio before and after the debate, 101.5FM and call in 
whenever they are talking about the candidates.  1-800-283-1015

It is important for all of us to remind listeners and viewers that Bret 
Schundler wants to take $600 million away from public schools for a private 
school network, allow people to carry concealed weapons in our communities 
and take away a woman's right to choose, even in the cases of rape and 
incest.
