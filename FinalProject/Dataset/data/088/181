Louise,

I can't tell you how excited I am to do it.  I also get the great pleasure of saying who I am working on it for along with working for you at work. 
It is taking a long time, as we bought a travel trailer and have been working on getting it ready for the deer lease.  I've decided (like that authority) when its finally complete that's when we'll have y'all over for dinner and present it to you then.  Tell me who your framer is, as I will have more items to frame down the road.

P. S. I showed you my son's Christmas stocking it took me a year to complete it and I was traveling a lot and used many flights as stitching time.

Thanks again for being #17!  I am very excited for you.

Best Regards,
Bobbi
