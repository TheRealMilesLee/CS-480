Dear Mr Steven Kean Esq: 

  

            Lions. tigers and bears and another conference . . . oh no!  WAIT - don't be like me and just put this one with all the other junk e-mail you receive and we know where that goes.  Take a look and see what's in store for us this year at CBI's 3rd Annual Financing US Projects Conference.  Believe me, I know what you are thinking.  Several conference brochures come across my desk every day and admittedly I have seen and heard too many of the same people speak about the same thing.  CBI, however, always seems to be able to bring something new and interesting each time they organize this conference.  Last year was a great success.  If you didn't make it last year, come see what you have been missing.  If you did, come back and hear and explore some of the latest developments in financing power projects. 

Before assembling their agenda, the Center for Business Intelligence makes a concerted effort to speak with professionals in our industry to ensure that the most popular topics and issues are addressed so that people like you and me can do our business better.  This year, CBI has assembled an excellent round of speakers who are experts in their fields and who will provide you with a first hand view of their experiences.

            Besides being an excellent networking opportunity, CBI's 3rd Annual Financing US Projects is assured to provide you with an opportunity to get an update on many interesting areas of financing power projects from both a debt and equity perspective. Join your colleagues at an event, which could once again be one of the most informative conferences of the year. 

            In a market like today, one cannot miss a conference like this!  This year's conference takes place in New York City on November 15-16, 2001.  What better way to round out the year and support a city struck by tragedy to emerge and lead our us all into a political and economic victory.  I hope you can join me and all of your other colleagues, bankers and consultants so that we can all share our views and experiences in a market, which appears to have no boundaries for creativity.  For more information or to register, call CBI toll free at 800-817-8601 (781-939-2438 outside the U.S.), e-mail cbireg@cbinet.com <mailto:cbireg@cbinet.com>, or visit <http://www.cbinet.com/>.  Hope to see you there! 

Sincerely, 

Eric L. McCartney 
Head of Project Finance - the Americas
