I DO like to go out on Halloween.  Maybe we can all hook up.  Do you guys dress up?  I'm out for the rest of the day.  My boss is riding with me for the day.  Talk to you later.

Hey, welcome back.  Sorry I missed you last night.  I was down in Cherry Creek having some drinks with friends, and didn't hear my phone.  Hope you had fun.
