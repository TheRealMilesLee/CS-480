Dear Colleague: 

I would like to direct your attention to a letter from New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, which you can find on the web site of the 2001 ASME International Mechanical Congress and Exposition: http://www.asme.org/congress

In the wake of September 11, Congress 2001 provides a special opportunity to consider our current challenges. Now more than ever, engineers need to share information and exchange views. 

Judging from early registration, we expect record attendance at this year's Congress, which will take place in New York on November 11-16. In addition to a truly outstanding technical program, participants will enjoy a wide range of opportunities for exploring the perspectives of colleagues from different companies, industries, and countries around the globe.            

I look forward to greeting you in New York next month. 

Sincerely, 


David L. Belden
Executive Director 
ASME International
