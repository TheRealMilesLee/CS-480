SBX2 1 (Soto/Scott) will be amended in committee today.  Although specific
amendments are not yet available, there will be a provision added to the
bill which will give the CPUC the authority to review generator and marketer
transaction records for the purpose of determining a base price.  This
amendment was requested by Loretta Lynch.

The analysis will point out several concerns raised by the Franchise Tax
Board, including the lack of definitions and lack of clarity of the bill in
terms of implementation.  It will also point out issues raised by Enron and
other opponents including the nexus problem, potential constitutional
problems including violations of the due process and commerce clauses, as
well as a de facto price cap.
