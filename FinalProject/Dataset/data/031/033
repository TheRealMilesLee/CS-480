Dear Sir,

Greeting to you, I am the son of the late Richard Mbomi Matingua (a forem=
ost
human rights activist in the Democratic Republic of Congo).My father died=

on December, 28th, 2004, as a result of the inhuman treatment meted out
onhim while in prison by the government of Laurent Joseph Kabila.

However, it is particularly important to mention here that before the dea=
th
of my father, he was a successful businessman and his business empire inc=
ludes
real estate, exportation, and consultancy services which cut across Afric=
a.He
was able to accumulate enough money both in local and foreign currencies
through his business empire. In fact, he was at one time rated among the
first five richest Congolese businessmen by one of the leading business
magazines in my country. His entire business has been on the upward trend=

over the past ten years, bringing his net profit during the period under
review to Nine Million Seven Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars ($9.7M), This
of course does not include his assets which are already running into Mill=
ions
of Dollars.

Having said all this, there was a twist in my father's success story foll=
owing
his confrontation with the government of Laurent Joseph Kabila, who has
been quite high-handed and dictatorial in his policies and day-to-day run=
ning
of the affairs of the Congolese people. My father being a human rights ac=
tivist,
criticised his government in both local and international newspapers.This=

infuriated him and he clamped my father in jail until he died on December=
,
28th, 2004, this year due to ill health. Fortunately, before the arrest
of my father,his attorney acting upon his instructions, transferred the
sum of Nine Million Seven Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars ($9.7m) from his
local banks to a Security Firm Abroad. He did this for fear of his accoun=
ts
being frozen by the government.Following my father's death, my entire fam=
ily
decided to seek political assylum in Ottam-lomei,Lome-Togo.As the eldest
son of my late father and according to our tradition in Africa.I have now=

inherited all my father's wealth.Considering the present face-off between=

Laurent Joseph Kabila and my family,I was then advised by my father's att=
orney
(presently my attorney) to seek the assistance of someone based in your
country to receive the amount in question being($9.7m).Since I have the
intention of relocating my family there with the aim of settling down the=
re
and investing. I have decided to give you 25% of the total amount for you=
r
services and assistance. 

To finalize this transaction you will have to contact me via my e-mail ad=
dress
above & markmbomi@walla.com, further discussions will be centered on how
and when you shall be meeting with the Security Firm Shortlisted Clearing=

Agent.I shall expect you to keep this transaction confidential due to the=

present circumstance of my family and I urgently await your response. 

Yours faithfull
Mark Mbomi Matingua.
