ATTN: Managing Director/Ceo,

TRANSFER OF TWELVE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED UNITED STATES DOLLARS. (US$12.5M)


I know that this message will come to you as a surprise since we don't know 
each other before, but for purpose of introduction,


I am lucas tejane, the Chief auditor of africa bank,(pty) south africa. 
There is an account opened in this bank in 1980 and since 1990 nobody has 
operated on this account again. After going through some old files in the 
records,I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it would 
be forfeited for nothing.

The owner of this account is Mr. smith Roland, a foreigner, and a miner at 
Kruger gold co., a geologist by profession and he died since 1990. No other 
person knows about this account or any  thing concerning it, the account has 
no other beneficiary and my  investigation proved to me as well that 
hiscompany does not know anything about  this account and the amount 
involved is (USD12.5m) twelve million five hundred  United States Dollars.


I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be 
approved to a local bank here, but can  only be approved to any foreign 
account because the money is in us  dollars and the former owner of 
theaccount is Mr. Smith Roland is a  foreigner too. I know that this message 
will come to you as a surprise as  we don't know ourselves before. We will 
sign an agreement, but be sure that it is real and a genuine business.


Please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take 
immediately. Send also your private telephone and fax number including the 
full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I want us to meet 
face to face or sign a binding agreement  to bind us together so that you 
can receive this money into a foreign account or any account of your choice 
where the fund will be safe. And I will fly to your country for withdrawal 
and sharing and other investments.

I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner with foreign 
account and foreign beneficiary. I need your full co-operation to make this 
work fine because the management is ready to approve this payment to any 
foreigner, who has correct information of this account,  which I will give 
to you immediately, if you are capable and willing to handle such amount in 
strict confidence and trust according to my instructions  and advice for our 
mutual benefit because this opportunity will never come again in my life. I 
need truthful person in this business because I don't  want to make mistake 
I need yourstrong assurance and trust. With my  position now in the office I 
can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account, which you can 
provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending my physical 
arrival in your country for sharing. I will  destroy all documents of 
transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place.

You can also come to discuss with me face to face after which I will make 
this remittance in your presence and two  of us will fly to your country at 
least two days ahead of the money going  into the account. I will apply for 
annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that you are  ready to 
act and receive this fund in your account.

I will use my position and influence to effect legal approvals and 
onwardtransfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance 
forms of the ministries and foreign  exchange departments.
At the conclusion of this business, you  will be given 25% of the total 
amount, 70% will be for me,and while 5%  will be for expenses both parties 
might have incurred during the process  of transfering. I look forward to 
your earliest reply through email or above fax number.

Best Regards.

Lucas Tejane.
