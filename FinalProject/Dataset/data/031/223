After the Day ahead market ran, the COI branch group TTC in the (N-S)
direction was changed from 4030 MW to 4000 MW; and the Path 15 branch group
TTC in the (N-S) direction was changed from 1275 MW to 1100 MW; and  the
Path 26 branch group TTC in the (N-S) direction was changed from 3000 MW to
2500 MW for HE's 1300 through 1800 for operating day 8/20/01.  The reason(s)
for the change is they were removed from service due to a low battery alarm.
The first applicable Hour Ahead market to run with these values is HE 1500.
The ISO will update you of any changes in line rating status.  Sent by
