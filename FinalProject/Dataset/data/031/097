with Private Placement preparation and public company reporting. The President of our company is a very

company public, please let us know. We are happy, for you to be generously compensated for any referrals.

I wish I could convey to you, all the many benefits of going public in a brief letter. I am not usre if you can 
imagine how valuable and powerful a public company can be in achieving your goals and objectives.
