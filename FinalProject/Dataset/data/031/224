Mark,

Based on your voicemail week before last, ICE is not willing to negotiate the contract, and we will have to execute their contract as is. Have we made anymore progress with getting the ICE contract executed?

Thanks,
Judy

Chuck -

As we discusssed, attached is a marked version of the Participation Agreement which I have marked with some comments.  Though I understand that we have existing agreements with ICE that were pretty much unchanged I was not involved in the original discussions relating to these agreements.  I also understand the message you left relating to the reluctance of ICE to modify the agreement.  I only ask that you review the attached and let me know your thoughts.

Thanks for the cooperation and time.

Mark
