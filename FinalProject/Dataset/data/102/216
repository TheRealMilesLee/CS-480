Internet Daily 
for Thursday, October 25, 2001
by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com


Web 'Wayback machine' switched on

An archive of 10 billion Web pages, dating back to 1996, has 
been launched at web.archive.org.

"We created the archive in 1996 because we felt it was critical 
to preserve a permanent record of this historically significant 
new medium for the public," said founder Brewster Kahle. The 
project, developed in conjunction with the Library of Congress 
and the Smithsonian Institution, made its official debut 
Wednesday night at the University of California at Berkeley. It 
will assist researchers and people "who just want to see how the 
media and our culture marked important historical events," said 
Paul Grabowicz, an assistant dean at the university.

Anthrax attacks see Web use boost

The president of America Online told a suburban Washington, 
D.C., audience that anthrax attacks against the U.S. postal 
system are likely to boost Internet use. "It's incredibly 
positive for the Internet," Raymond Oglethorpe said at a 
breakfast sponsored by the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce, 
the Washington Post reported. He quickly added the recent events 
were "unfortunate." Oglethorpe also said the terrorist attacks 
have hurt revenue for the AOL Time Warner  subsidiary because 
the market for online advertising "has absolutely gone away," 
the Post reported.

Online travel: up in the air

Travel service etailers are waiting to see if the nation's Big 
Three air carriers -- Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and 
American Airlines  -- follow Continental Airlines  in the 
latter's unexpected move to eliminate commissions on sales 
completed through the Internet. Northwest Airlines  took the 
same step in March.

Online travel market analyst Lorraine Silleo of PhoCusWright was 
puzzled by Continental's decision, according to a Los Angeles 
Times report. "You would think the airlines would want to work 
with as many distribution outlets as possible right now to fill 
their seats, not take them away," she told the newspaper. But 
she also expects etravel firms such as Expedia  and 
Travelocity.com  will negotiate agreements with the airlines 
enabling them to make bookings and charge fees.
