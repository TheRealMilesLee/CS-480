Phillip,

The Social Security and Medicare tax has been previously withheld on your deferral.  You would be subject to only Federal Income Tax withholding on the distribution.  I checked with my director (Pam Butler) on your question about recouping taxes already paid.  It is my understanding that you cannot recoup these taxes.

Thanks,

Renee

Renee,

Thank you for the forms.  I am trying to estimate my tax obligation.  It is my understanding that the account balance will be treated as ordinary income.  What about Social Security and Medicare taxes?  I thought those were already deducted.  Also, the are no earnings on the deferrals I have made.  On the contrary, there are losses.  Is it possible to recoup any taxes paid?

Thanks for you help.

Phillip
