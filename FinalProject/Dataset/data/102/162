PROS Revenue Management, the world's leader in pricing and revenue optimization science and software, invites you to attend PROS Pricing Optimization Web Seminar on Wednesday, November 14, 2001, from 2:00 to 3:30 pm Central Time.

Recently, a Wall Street analyst was quoted: "By 2001, companies that neglect to implement yield management techniques will become uncompetitive."  PROS Revenue Management solutions have been credited with delivering 6-8% incremental revenue and 20-100% incremental profits.   This Web seminar will allow industry leaders from virtually all industries to learn from the experience PROS has gained in over 15 years of deploying these solutions.

This seminar will cover the basics of increasing revenues and profits through optimizing pricing decisions.  It will give participants an overview of how real-time data can be used to forecast demand elasticity and optimize prices.  Participants of previous PROS seminars have found them to be extremely helpful in improving their business and making them more valuable to their respective organizations.

The Web format for the seminar will allow participants to attend from remote locations, ask questions in real-time, and interact with the presenter through an Internet browser and toll-free telephone number.  

This seminar is free of charge, but spaces are limited and will be available on a first come first served basis.
