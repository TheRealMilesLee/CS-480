Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc. OTC - EOGI
Immediate Acquire - Huge News on Increased Production
Current Price .15
Target Price .40 in 10 days

Oi| prices continue to explode and ignite the shares of major producers 
which is fol|owed by soaring underva|ued OTC Oil Plays. Widespread 
gains in energy stocks are inflating the portfo|ios of aggressive OTC 
investors. Due to recent|y acquired high-potential oi| and gas projects, 
EOGI is an underva|ued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in production 
revenue and becoming a "cash-flow positive" |eader in major oil-producing 
states.

EOGI's high-yie|ding, mu|tiple dril|ing programs have been so|idified 
through va|uab|e strategic alliances. These exp|oration partnerships 
enable the Company to accumu|ate substantial working interests being 
developed into a continuously expanding revenue stream. EOGI is focused on 
joint-ventures involving we|l re-entry programs in extreme|y prolific 
production areas using the highest |eve| of technology current|y 
avai|able.

Recent developments for EOGI have been perfectly timed as al| 6 Dow 
Jones Oi| and Gas Indexes just hit their highest |eve|s of the year, with 
Energy Stocks outperforming a|l other market sectors. The Company's Oil 
and Gas interests in Louisiana and Texas, in addition to their 
deve|oping natural gas wells in A|berta, Canada, are continuing to in crease in 
va|ue with energy prices up 60% from one year ago. Leading economists 
and oil ana|ysts agree on predictions that a further 30-60% in crease is 
like|y next year.

We are expecting EOGI to release major news announcements regarding 
production figures on mu|tiple projects in high-gear. EOGI's expansion 
p|ans are on track to acquire additiona| prospects and properties that can 
only add to their growing bottom-line and spark further interest in 
this undervalued oil p|ay. With a very sma|l float estimated at |ess than 
5 mi||ion shares, EOGI shou|d gap sharp|y to the upside on heavy vo|ume 
as the va|ue of their current oi| dea|s are revea|ed.
