• Royal Waterlily Acquires $20 Million Interest in European Real Estate Company <br>
Business Wire (Thu, Dec 9)<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
What is Royal Waterlily?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Royal Waterlily (OTC: RYLW) is a development stage company that intends to focus their interests on investing in lucrative real estate activities. The company is looking forward to investing into properties in the USA and abroad for the potential of capital appreciation and income from operations. With the recent boom in real estate appreciation and development, Royal Waterlily (OTC: RYLW) is anticipating easy entry to participate in the phenomena. &nbsp;The company possesses an extremely knowledgeable team of management that will guide them to top opportunities that currently exist.<br>
<br>
More specifically, the Company has identified development opportunities in the Northeast and Southeast United States, where many redevelopment efforts and gray-fill projects are now underway that would meet the company's objectives. The Company hopes to have several projects under agreement in the near future.<br>
<br>
Additional activities of the Company will be the acquisition and development of resort properties, both in the U.S. and in other countries. The Company has identified several opportunities to invest both in existing resorts and in resort developments in the Southern Caribbean, namely Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
Why I Should Consider &nbsp;RYLW?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Royal Waterlily is positioned to succeed in the real estate / leisure sector.<br>
<br>
· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Recent exchange in stock with Resol A/S reinforces asset base tremendously. <br>
<br>
· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Recent deal with Resol A/S gives company an intrinsic value HIGHER than current trading price.<br>
<br>
· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Management team has valuable expertise in real estate and the credentials to best ascertain the objectives of their business plan.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
Real Estate Investment in 2005 <br>
<br>
Home Prices Still Headed Higher In 2005<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
One good thing you can say about the pundits who keep predicting that the end is near for rising home prices: They're consistent. They've been dead wrong year after year.<br>
<br>
Given the escalation of home prices in most areas of the country over the past few years, potential real estate investors may be wondering if they have missed the boat on profit opportunities. But the fact is, according to many industry experts, a major national housing boom may be brewing over the next decade<br>
<br>
And those who fear that we're in a fragile real-estate bubble can relax -- at least for now. Say experts including chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, who speaks for most chastened housing-market analysts when he says that the chance that median home prices will drop is "zero nationally, zero in major regions and close to zero in any state," although some individual cities may see declines.<br>
<br>
Sources as diverse as Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing agree that strong demand and muted supply will likely continue to push home prices up in most areas at an average of five to six percent a year.<br>
<br>
All the economic cards but one point to another strapping year for housing prices in 2005.<br>
<br>
The overwhelming body of evidence suggests that now is as good a time as any to consider investing in real estate.<br>
<br>
One such way is by investing in professional real estate development companies. One interesting pure real estate play is the developmental real estate development company, is Royal Waterlilly, Inc.<br>
<br>
The U.S. Census Bureau projects the number of American households will increase by more than 12 million by the year 2010. This increases the argument that investors who perhaps already had part of their portfolio invested in real estate stocks have been increasing their allocation, and those who didn’t have come to the conclusion there's a good case to be made for adding some real estate to your portfolio. <br>
<br>
Recently, Royal Waterlily, Inc. has acquired 4,000,000 shares in Resol A/S, a Danish real estate corporation, publicly traded at the Swedish stock exchange, in exchange for 7,500,000 shares of the Company. Resol shares trade at the equivalent of approximately $5.00 per share, which puts the total value of the transaction at $20,000,000. This transaction along with overall market timing, economic and financial forecast for 2005 earns RYLW our highest rating of ten out of ten.<br>
<br>
- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Accumulate aggressively<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Stock Forecast: RYLW is trading extremely low in the” Red Hot” Real Estate Sector. &nbsp;We believe that this offers the investor a fantastic risk reward scenario. &nbsp;We are therefore recommending the purchase of RYLW up to the $2.00 price range<br>
<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
THE COMPANY<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Royal Waterlily, Inc. (“RWI” or “the Company”) is a Nevada Corporation founded in February 1996.<br>
<br>
The Company is a development stage enterprise that intends to focus its efforts on real estate related activities, as follows:<br>
<br>
1) To participate in development projects, both in the United States and in other countries that offer the opportunity for generating income from operations and capital appreciation.<br>
<br>
2) The Company has identified development opportunities in the Clearwater, FL, Pinellas County area, where many redevelopment efforts and gray-fill projects are now underway, that offer the opportunity for generating income from operations and capital appreciation.<br>
<br>
3) The Company has identified the opportunity to invest in a resort development on the island of Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles, in the Southern Caribbean Sea, a recognized world famous diving destination. This resort development will offer the opportunity for generating income from operations and capital appreciation.<br>
<br>
4) To operate in the field of purchasing and selling of foreclosed properties.<br>
<br>
Re. 1): The Company believes it has identified significant opportunities to be active in the field of acquiring (partial) interests in different real estate development projects. Through a designated Limited Liability Company, in which the Company will take a financial interest of approximately 20%, as well as the position of Managing Partner, the Company has the possibility to acquire a majority interest in projects that have been identified to possess sufficient quality to create positive returns for the Company. The Company intends to purchase partial interests in real estate development projects in different stages of development. Depending on the actual stage of development at which the company gets involved in the project, it can create additional value by using its expertise in furthering
these projects.<br>
<br>
Re. 2): In Pinellas County, FL, and more specifically in the Clearwater area, a lot of redevelopment and so-called gray-fill redevelopment is going on. The Clearwater municipality is one of the fastest growing cities in the United States and many old developments will be replaced by contemporary projects. The opportunities vary from relatively small projects to larger developments, both residential and commercial. The Company is in the process of selecting specific projects, that combine a low degree of risk with an attractive return on investment.<br>
<br>
Re.3): The Company will have the opportunity to acquire a majority interest in a Netherlands Antilles corporation that aims to purchase the long lease rights to an abandoned resort on the island of Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles, in the southern part of the Caribbean Sea. Bonaire is a recognized world famous diving destination. After the acquisition of the property, it will be redeveloped as a three star mixed-use family diving resort, with a majority of the units available to timeshare.<br>
<br>
Re. 4): The company believes it has identified a significant opportunity to be active in the field of purchasing real estate property at liquidation sales, auctions, and in other instances that offer the potential of purchasing below appraisal value. Properties will be sold again within a limited time frame, after renovation or other maintenance work if and when this will enhance the sale price. Given the right financial conditions, the properties will be rented out for a longer period of time, prior to being sold again on the market. To this purpose the company will contract with teams of seasoned real estate experts; initially one team in the Central Florida area, followed by a team in the Atlanta area. These two geographical areas will be the initial focal points for this kind of activities.
As long as the company will have only limited resources to fund these activities, only one team will be active.<br>
<br>
Although the Company’s primary initial emphasis will be on real estate related activities and development, the Company reserves the right to utilize the proceeds of the Offering for other purposes if management of the Company deem such other purposes as beneficial to the Company and its shareholders.<br>
