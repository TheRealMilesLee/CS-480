Dear Friend, 

Let me start by introducing myself properly to you.I am  Mr Buchi Ude 
 an Accountant with the Bills and Exchange department, Foreign Remittance=

office African Express Banking Corporation (AEBC). I am writing you this
letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transac=
tion.

We discovered an abandoned sum of US$20. 5 million (Twenty million five
hundred thousand US Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our For=
eign
customer who died along side his entire family in November 1990 in a plan=
e
crash. Since this development, we have advertised for his next of kin or
any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came
to apply for the claim. To this effect, I and two other officials in my
office, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand
in as the next of kin to the deceased and claim this money. 

We need a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that=

the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the
Bank's Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process
will emanate from my table and I will perfect every document to be in acc=
ordance
with the banking law and guidelines, So you have nothing to worry about.
We have agreed that 30% of the money will be for you, 10% for expenses in=
curred
on both sides, 10% will be donated to the charity organization while 50%
will be for my colleagues and I. If you are going to help me, indicate by=

replying this letter and putting in your PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER=
S,AND
YOUR FULL ADDRESS OF CONTACT to enable me meet up with the banking requir=
ement.

I await your immediate reply to enable us start this transaction in earne=
st.
Please reply me with this e-mail address or through my alternative email
address above. 

Please,visit:http://www.greatdreams.com/PassEAir990.htm

Thanks for your anticipated assistance. 

Yours faithfully

Mr Buchi Ude=20
