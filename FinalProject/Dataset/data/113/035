Dear Mr. Lay -

My name is Bobby Gerry and I am an employee here at Enron.
I do not know if I may be able to provide any financial help to Enron, but certainly I would like to make myself available.

As a family, we own an approximate $700 million in Exxon stock and maintain excellent relationships with several investment banks.

My mother, Sandra Mosbacher, myself, my brother, as well as my Aunt Caroline Law have all been actively following Enron's situation and are available to help in any way we can.

Sincerest regards,
Bobby Gerry
