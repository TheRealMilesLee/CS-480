Michelle
What is your opinion related to OneOk's invoice underpayments related to the Libcomb/Mocane outage.  This past due amount is getting old and it needs to be resolved?  I just don't want this difference to be outstanding on the AR aging much longer.

thanks

Michelle,

Oneok Bushton (Sherry Rogers) has not returned my calls regarding the outstanding payment of the following invoices on firm transportation contract 25374:

Invoice		Due Date	Amount		
213760		07/13/01	32,984.02	June Reservation
213986		07/13/01	  1,515.99	June Commodity (delivery of 163,009 MM's to TW/NNG Beaver, 6/1-6/11)
214462		08/13/01	35,305.88	July Reservation
214159		08/13/01	     344.12	July Commodity (delivery of 37,002 MM's to TW/NNG Beaver, 7/2/-7/31)

				(18,509.88)	Partial payment received 8/17/01 (detail unknown)

				51,640.13	Outstanding balance (not including late payment charges)


Sherry originally called me in mid July to question why we were billing the full reservation amount for June since we were experiencing a "force majeure" at the Lipscomb/Mocane lateral that included the TW/NNG Beaver (primary delivery point) facility.  The outage was termed planned maintenance for June 12, but unplanned maintenance for June 13 through July 27.  If you need any additional information, please call me.


Thanks,  Bert
