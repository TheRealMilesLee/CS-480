Tana,

To follow-up with the message I left with you.  

Cinergy Services would like to transact on US East Financial Power product PJM Bal of Day and the new Cinergy Hourly Index (which is coming on-line soon).

I understand they don't have a Master Agreement under this entity.  The trader mentioned a "long form confirm", which is what is governing the trades they do with us OTC and is wondering if that would suffice.

Please call their attorney Mr. Jeff Gollomp to discuss.

Thanks for your assistance !

T.
