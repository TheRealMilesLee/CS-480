Darren:
I have another HPLC issue...I received an invoice from Four Square Gas Company today for May 2001 gas that was never paid.  They have invoiced 1,654 at 4.825 (HSC - .085) at meter 986887.  I did not see a deal in Unify, so I went to POPS to find the meter.  I found that the gas was pathed to the Strangers Gas contract.  Historically, HPLC has always purchased the gas at this meter from Four Square, but it doesn't look like a deal was ever entered for May.  The April deal number was 695469.  Did HPLC purchase this gas in May?
