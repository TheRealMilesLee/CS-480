Attached is a paper from Comed.  It is substantially the same as the paper that they proposed about a month ago.  I will look over it today to determine whether or not we can support.  Appreciate any comments if you have a chance...

regards
Mike

All:

After I sent out the draft late yesterday afternoon, I found out that FERC
had extended the deadline from November 5 to "as soon as reasonably
possible."  Obviously, we would like to provide everyone with sufficient
time to review the draft and get approvals.  We also have a saying in
Chicago - "Vote early and often" and at least with respect to the "vote
early" we think it is important to get comments in early.

Therefore we now suggest that instead of replying by the end of today as to
whether you can sign or not sign and what must be added or deleted for you
to join, we suggest responding by the end of Friday.  This will allow us to
circulate another draft and get comments in by the middle of next week and
have considerable influence on the process.

Thanks for your help under these changing circumstances.


Steve
