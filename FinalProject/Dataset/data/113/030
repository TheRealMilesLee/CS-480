Mary/Sara-

Looks like more counterparties are thinking about netting.  See below.   Under the current circumstances, is our procedure going to be sending out our newly developed master to all counterparties looking to enter into netting arrangements?

John

John,

We need to have a netting agreement in place with Crown Central.  Please review the attached format and let me know if you are OK with it.
