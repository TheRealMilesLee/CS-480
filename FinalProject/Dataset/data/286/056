Dear Guenter,

I am Mr. WILLIAMS OKON, Bank Manager Orient Bank Nigeria
plc, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential
business proposal for you.

On June 6, 1997,a JORDAN Oil consultant/contractor with the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr.KHALED ALI made
a numbered time(Fixed)Deposit for twelve calendar months,
valued at US$17,800,000.00 (Seventeen Million Eight hundred
thousand Dollars) in my branch.Upon maturity, I sent a
routine notification to his forwarding address but got no
reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we
discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation that Mr.KHALED ALI died from
an autocrash accident.

On further investigation and discovered that Mr. KHALED
ALI did not declare any kin or relations in all his
official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in
my Bank. This sum of US$17,800,000.00 is still sitting in
my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the
principal sum at the end of each year. No one has ever come
forward to claim it.Consequently, my proposal is that I will
like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to
Mr.KHALED ALI so that the fruits of this old man's labour will
not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your
full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the
necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in
place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of
two Attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and
to obtain the necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

A bank account in any part of the world which you will
provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to
you as the beneficiary/next of kin.The money will be paid
into your account for us to share in the ratio of 80% for
me and 20% for you. There is no risk at all as all the
paper work for this transaction will be done by the Attorney
and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful
execution of this transaction. If you are interested,
please reply immediately Upon your response,I shall then
provide you with more details regarding this transaction.
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured
that this transaction would be most profitable for both of
us because I shall require your assistance to invest parts
of my share in your country.

REGARDS,

MR.WILLIAMS OKON
BRANCH MANAGER,
ORIENT BANK NIGERIA PLC.
