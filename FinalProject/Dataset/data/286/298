Dear Friend,

My name is Charles Winta (Jnr). I am sending you this mail with grief and sorrow in my heart because  I am being subjected to physical and psychological trauma by my own blood brothers.

I am the first son of late Chief Charles Winta(snr) who died last year of heart failure. Before his death, he was the traditional ruler of my land that is enriched with oil. Due to environmental disasters caused, the multinational oil companies operating in my town pays huge sums of money  to the town through my father who happened to be the traditional ruler. In addition, he also receives personal imbursements as the towns traditional ruler from the oil companies. Suffix to say that my father accumulated enormous wealth.

When I was young, I had an accident with my late mother who died instantly in the auto crash. My both legs were amputated as last resort after medical attempts to save them failed. My father then married another wife to ensure that I have someone who will take care of me. 

When my father died, he willed the sum of $5.3m(Five millon, three hundred thousand united states dollars) to me simply because he envisaged what I am going to face in the hands of my step-brothers. Considering my crippled situation he wanted to make sure that he left enough money to last me my entire life so that I will not have to beg to live.

Ever since my father died, I have not had peace because my half brothers are trying to claim everything which my late father left behind with the support of their mother, saying that am a cripped man and that am of no use to the family . I have to let you know  that these my brothers are evils and ready to kill. I have surrendered all my late father's company documents and files to them just to let peace come into the family but to no avail. 

The money he willed to me is unknown to them and I have decided to leave this country for good in other to be alive and invest the money in another country. It is my plan to invest my money in a lucrative business. When I enquired, I was told that real estate is a very good business in your country. That is why I decided to contact you because I know with your experience in business, we cannot go wrong in the investment. 

Therefore, I solicit for your help to make it possible for me to transfer this fund to your country and invest there. I promise you a reasonable percentage of the fund when we discuss the details. 

Please let me know if you can help me. I will need the following information so that I can issue you a power of attorney with which you can use to contact the bank and get the money from them:

1)Your full name and contact address .
2)Your personal telephone and fax

I await eagerly to hear from you. May God bless you as you help the needy ones.

Sincerely Yours,

Charles.
