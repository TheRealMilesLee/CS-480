Dear Sir,

read through it before making a decision whether to assist me or not,also =
solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature =
as being utterly confidential and top secret. Though I know that a =
transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried,but I =
am assuring you that you do have anything to worry as I have perfected every =
arrangement with my colleague .

I have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction,as I am =
aware of the high sense of responsibility placed on you and believe in your =
discreetness and ability to handle transaction of this nature.Let me start by =
introducing myself properly to you.

I am MR.Elhadji Dieye(Chief Officer) of trust bond DAKAR-SENEGAL.I came to =

Confidence.

Please the objective of this letter is to first ascertain your sincerity =

in your reply.

THE PROPOSITION:
A Foreigner from Germany, Late Mr.Partner Van Henk(Snr.) a precious stone =
(Diamond) Merchant with THE UNITA rebel movement of Angola, until his death =
in August the year 2001, used our services as his fiduciary agent and account =
trustees and had a closing balance as at the end of September,2001 worth the =
sum of US$12,500,000.00 USD (Twelve Million, Five Hundred Thousand United =
States Dollars only),our firm now expects a next of kin as beneficiary. 

Valuable efforts are being made by this firm to get in touch with any of the =
Partner Van Henk Family or Relatives but to no success since then.It is =
because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any of Late =
Partner Van Henk(Snr.)'s next of kin (He had no wife or children that is =
known to us). The management under the influence of Our Chairman and Few =
influencial Members of the Board of Directors, has instructed that =
arrangement be made for the fund to be declared "Unclaimed" and subsequently =
be donated to yet to be specified trust fund.I strongly believe the chairman =
might be up to something funny with his group.

In order to avert this development that will not take care of my interest,one =
of my trusted colleague and I who are anticipating interest now seek your =
permission to have you stand as the next of kin to Late Partner Van =
Henk(Snr.) so that the fund US$12,500,000.00 USD will be released and paid =
into your account as the beneficiary's next of kin. All documents and proofs =
to enable you get this fund will be carefully worked out.

We have secured from the probate an order of mandamus suspending declaring =
the money as unclaimed with limited time to locate any of the deceased =
beneficiary's next of kin, and moreso we are assuring you that this business =
is 100% risk free involvement.

purposes, according to the agreement we shall reach mutually.As soon as we =
receive an acknowledgement of receipt of this message in acceptance of our =
mutual business proposal, we would furnish you with the two =
options/modalities we have carefully perfected for you to choose from with =
our insider information depending on your convenience to accomplish the =
project and disbursement ratio to suit both parties without any conflict.

If this proposal is acceptable by you, please do not make undue advantage of =
the trust we are to bestow on you, Reply only to my Private Email Address: =
elhadji24@netscape.net .
