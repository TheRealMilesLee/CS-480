I will give Blake a copy of our phone list.  

Margaret Doucette is the person setting up id's and requesting program clearance.  I will let her know about Blake needing access to Outlook.  Please be aware that the requests have been taking a few days before they are completed.  Computer guys are staffed!

Can you please give Blake a copy of a phone list?
Also, can Blake get security clearance for our email system?

He is going to have a security badge in a few days.
