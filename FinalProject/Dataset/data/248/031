Yeah, yeah...My own personal management plan is to shoot does and/or a spike or booger head and make my "Trophy" a BIG OLD EIGHT or a Main Frame 10 or better only. Well, I guess I couldn't pass the Main Frame 8 with the crab claw and kicker off the G2 that was discussed last week. He's just TOO DAMN PRETTY...Uh oh, gotta go...Got "wood" just thinking about it.

This year marked your move towards correcting that problem. Now you need to 
take it to the next level and touch off on booger headed deer and does 
instead of rattling them up all over the ranch and telling us about them. e.
