That means it's time to hunt outside the boxes.

	I agree, we started out with 3, went to 1, no we are going in the wrong direction again.  By the way, wasn't Mertz supposed to add more acreage to this ranch?  I think we have hunted everything we can on ol' Autry.

		Wait a minute, lets think about this.  We already have one attorney on the lease, can we handle another??     We're gonna need a bigger ranch!

			Think this a great idea...he is just the ideal person to have on the lease
			and as standup and nice of a guy you would ever want to know. I'd give him a
			bid right away!!!

			Deer All:
			
			I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to
			
			fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).
			
			B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head
			of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they
			were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and
			doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
			Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot.
			His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking
			for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out
			there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and
			would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.
			
			He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I
			don't care about that.
			
			Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could
			proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up
			taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two
			
			spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this
			
			spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be
			the fall back plan.
			
			Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.
			
			
			Erik.
