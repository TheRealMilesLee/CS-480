Jerry,
I talked to Ronnie Morse, and he says the outage at Station 4 is scheduled to be completed 5-3.  They will then send equipment in to be repaired or rebuilt and then returned to Station 6.  Am attaching outage request and if there are any questions, please call or e-mail. 
Thanks,
Steve/Laguna Team              << File: 602OUTAGErequest.XLS >>
