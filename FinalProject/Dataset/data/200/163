Hi Andrea and J.P.:

I remembered the other day you advised we should wait on this book request until further notice, but today Cecilia said she has aleady got the book codes from Bill Hare.  (please see the attached email below)

Should we ask Cecilia to go ahead?

Jon,

I have completed the request for book setups and attached the completed sheet with ID's.  I have a few contacts to complete within the next 10 minutes.

We have already created gas books for the top half of the list.  We now need to attach Gas Daily (I and Y risk types)to these books.  Also, we need to create gas books for the bottom half of the list, as well as, attach Gas Daily (I and Y risk types).

Thank you.

J.P.
