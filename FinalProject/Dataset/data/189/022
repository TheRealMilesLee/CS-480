Michelle:  

ok we are all set up.  We are going to do a snow shoe trip on Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. for 2 hours.  Supposedly easy trail, just enough to work up a sweat.  Then we are going to drive (45 minute scenic drive) to Hot Springs, Co.  Probably have time for a lunch.  Our messages are set up for 3:00 p.m. and we get to soak in any one of 21 sulphur pools at our leisure.  Sounds divine doesn't it?

Since they have to put salt on the pavement the guy suggested that we bring our own flip flops.  He says we can rent towels and robes but if I remember I'll bring them for us as backups if they don't have any available.

So looks like you just need warm clothing and flip flops.  Oh yeah, do you have a warm pair of boots.  We can rent the snowshoing equipment but we have to have a good pair of warm boots.  If you don't think you have a pair let me know and I can bring an extra pair along.  Hopefully they won't be too big for your tiny feet.  But boots are usually big anyway just wear lots of socks!

Let me know,

Terri Dickerson
