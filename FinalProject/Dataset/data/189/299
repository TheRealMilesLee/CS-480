Nice to know that the animal does not ALWAYS lose.
 
 

 
Subject:  DELICACY.

 
An Arizona cowboy stopped at a local restaurant 
following a day of drinking and roaming around in 
Mexico. While sipping his tequila, he noticed a 
sizzling, scrumptious looking platter being served at 
the next table. Not only did it look good, the smell was wonderful. 
 
He asked the waiter, "What is that you just served?" 
The waiter replied, "Ah senor, you have excellent taste! deese are bull's testicles from de bull 
fight this morning. A delicacy!" 
 
The cowboy, though momentarily daunted, said, "What the heck, I'm on vacation down here! Bring me an order!" 
 
The waiter replied, "I am so sorry senor. Dere is only one serving per day because dere is only one bull fight each morning. If you come early tomorrow and place your order, we will be sure to save you these delicacy!" 
 
The next morning, the cowboy returned, placed his order, and then that evening he was served the one and only special delicacy of the day. After a few bites, and inspecting the contents of his platter, he called to the waiter and said, "These are delicious, but >my portion is much, much smaller than the one I saw you serve yesterday!" 
 
The waiter shrugged his shoulders and replied, "Si, Senor. Sometimes de bull, he wins."
