Georgeanne,

Attached below is Treasury's initial project plan for a full banking system replica for Netco.  As you will see we have estimated we can be up and running with basic wire functionality by 1/23/01 and a full system of checks, issuance files, ACH's and Workstation within 93 days.  We do reserve the right to amend and or clarify this plan as we have time to complete our due diligence on the full system requirements and the impact of the changes.  Currently the plan does not include the Citibanking installation which will be included as soon as possible and will not extend the project deadline.

 
Regards,

Marcus Pullicino
