Absolutely agree with Dave.  Any services agreement should be invisible to the market and Newco should be seen as the conterparty.  The services agreement should just pertain to the time that Newco does not have the staff to service it...as short as time as possible.

Guys, the nature, term, etc of any such agreement will have to be agreed to by Jeff McMahon. I would not be supportive of any long-term services agreement without a very close examination of the economics. A term agreement, at the right price, where NewCo continues to control the business relationship and optionality may be a win-win and provide maximum benefit to the estate.

In order to get Peoples up and running as soon as possible - we will need (as Netco) to enter into a service agreement with the Estate - can you set this up with Don or Jim.
