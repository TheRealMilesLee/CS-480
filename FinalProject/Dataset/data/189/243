FYI:


Neartown Neighbors,

Received today a nice color map of State Representative Debra Danburg's new district (#134) in response to my asking her office, what are the street boundaries.

Neartown is divided, north and south by Montrose Blvd.in the following manner:   From Allen Parkway, south on Montrose Blvd to Sul Ross. At Sul Ross, the boundary is the west side of Precinct # 0123. A five x seven block dog-leg to the Southwest Fwy.

West of Montrose Blvd, you are in Danburg's new district #134. East of Montrose, you are in State Representative Garnet Coleman's district #147.  

Danburg is definitely running for re-election, in a district that now includes all of River Oaks, Memorial Park, Bellaire, West U., and the medical center. 

She's been in office for 20 years (number 10 in seniority!), and I'm told that this is her first time to face genuine opponents (there are at least four) since she first took the oath of office.

As it happens, as a member of the Houston Association of Realtor's Political Action Committee, I'm part of the screening committee interviewing state and congressional candidates all of this week in preparation for the March primaries.

You should know, too, that Neartown/Montrose resident, Realtor and past Cherryhurst CA president, Jeff Kuchar, is also a Realtor PAC member involved in the interviews. 

To those folks that communicated to me a desire to sue, protest or to do something about the redistricting, about NTA being cut in half...it's over. The entire state is reacting to the federal court's decision by getting down to business. It's a new era for state legislative elections.

I'll let you know when I learn more.

Thanks,

Ed Gonzales
