Rod,
I wanted to forward this to you.  Arthur Warga is the professor I spoke about that is an incredible Financial wiz.  He worked under Ron Singer but he is now the new Interim Dean.  This may be a great opportunity for you and Professor Warga to meet to discuss Finance curriculum which would help in Analyst recruiting.

Thanks,
Tracey Kozadinos

The C.T. Bauer College of Business at the University of Houston main campus has just named Professor Arthur Warga as the new interim Dean.  What an excellent choice!  Anyone who knows Professor Warga or had the opportunity to be instructed by him knows he is a financial genius and is known nationally for his Fixed Income research and Fixed Income training program designed for the World Bank.
