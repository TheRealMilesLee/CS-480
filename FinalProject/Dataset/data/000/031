	List of accomplishments for Rob Benson

	1. Made a fast and profitable transition from cash cinergy trader to term PJM trader.
	2. Current P/L is over $67,000,000, budget for the year was set at $15,000,000.
	3. No losing months, worst month was positive $2,700,000.
	4. Very high return on VAR, don't have actual numbers ( sorry ).
	5. Done two customer load following deals, both have turned out to be very profitable.
	6. Exceeded all EOL goals, both number of trades and volume. Each month I'm in the top 3 in east power for number of trades and volume.
	7. Have always stayed within my VAR limits
	8. I have become the market for all PJM trades, both on and off peak.
	9. My P/L has come from intra-day trading as well as an underlying fundamental position in both on and off peak. P/L did not come from just one big move.
	10. Have always put on positions based on my fundamental view, even if that view differed from others on the desk.
