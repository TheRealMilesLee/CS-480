We have an obligation to supply.  The issue is what payment arrangements are
easiest for the customer & minimise our risk

Keith:		

I think you must provide service to all who request it.     Is that the
case?     If not, from a credit standpoint, how do you determine if you
will provide service to a new company or individual?

Not sure of the context of your request but we have prepared a schedule
of
our payment options and a code of practice on debt collection

Keith
I have attached the following:

1 file showing our current range of payment arrangements - this is as
shown
in the Charges Scheme
2 a copy of our code of practice on debt recovery - pages 4 and 5 give
detail on timescales for chasing debt and how we go about it.  It does
also
give some detail on payment options.

Is this ok or is it too detailed?
Cheers
Sue

Subject: Credit Policies


Would each of you send me a copy of your credit policies or the rules
relative to granting of credit (credit extended to customers)?     I
would expect that it will be in the tariff or some other regulatory
document, or even a charteer or license.    I don't need the whole
document, only the portion relative to credit.    Please fax or email to
me.   
Thanks.
