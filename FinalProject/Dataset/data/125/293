I sold 35 MW's HE 0800-0900 to RESI (Unregulated - Kyle) for $20.50.  I scheduled it to the South Zone in the ERCOT Portal.  I talked to Bill and it seems that he scheduled it to the South Zone.

We are long 50 mw's tomorrow under the Hourly Ercot book for he 7-22.    The length is schedule to the North zone.     We should sell hours ending 7-9 and leave the length in the pool for the balance of the day.
We paid $21.75,  so if you can get a signigicant premium for a 16 hour block,  sell off the entire amount.


The imbalance sale in Enpower is deal #866577.  The purchase from Ercot asset is 866844,  but you shouldnt need to adjust the purchase side.   The purchase is an interdesk deal,  so it wont show in Enpower deal scheduling.  Any questions?

Thanks,
JMF
