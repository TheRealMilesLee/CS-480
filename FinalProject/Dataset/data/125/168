Ken,  I just wanted to say thanks for all that you and Enron have done for me.  I know you trusted people close to you and they let you down for that Im sorry.  I have always believed in you and what you stand for.  I  know it took tremendous courage to do what you have done over the last couple of weeks.  Whether the people at Enron like it or not I believe you put us first.  I trust that your decision was the right thing given the circumstances. Yes, Im deeply hurt by the last month but the true spirit of Enron will last within me forever.   I started at this company a mid level IT Administrator and I am now a seasoned Director level technologist and leader.  I have had 4 promotions in the last 5 1/2 years.  I have been challenged by this environment.  I believe that I can go anywhere and be successful because of meeting those challenges.  No where else could have provided me these opportunities. In return Im going to stay committed and have faith that due to that committment the Enron spirit will live on.  With all the bad I wanted to remind you of the good. My years of employment with Enron have been the best of my career.  No matter what happens I know I will be fine. I truly wish you and your family the best.  

Take Care
Mike Croucher
