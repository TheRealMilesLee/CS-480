your WHEREAS clause is fine.
We can develop a list but again it usually  only covers a specific transaction

I'll change the "Transaction" definition and the first WHEREAS to:

WHEREAS.....relating to the possible purchase by Transwestern of Company's weather derivative product (the "Transaction").  Is this okay?

When I was working on the VOD team at EBS, we talked with so many companies (as did other groups within EBS).  It was handy to know who was tied to us with a conf. agreement.  I thought it might be helpful here too.

You need to change the definition of Transaction in the first WHEREAS clause and then you can send it.

I could put together a list we have copies of them in the legal dept.  What do you want to use the list for??

Lee,

I made the changes to the Duke confidentiality agreement that you sent me, basically just the name changes.  Is there anything else I need to do, or can I just print this out and send it to them?  Please let me know.

Also,  Is there a list of companies that have a confientiality agreement with Transwestern?
