Michelle -- that's why I worded it the way I did.  I only have enterprise access to SAP.  Kathy Schultea would be the person who could query the global system and/or the old EPC system if they were terminated in EPC.  
Any other questions, please let me know.
Thanks.
Jo Ann

Thanks for the information, however I have a question for the 14
individuals in which we have "No record in SAP".   Do we know for certain
that these individuals where not employed with Enron , or is it that there
is no record of them in SAP HR.  Would a query out of the HR datawarehouse
tell us more information?

Thanks,
Kevin
