First of all, thanks for doing all the things nobody will ever know about over the last two weeks that saved our company.

Second, I need to get your OK on our designs for Phase 3 so we can go to production in the next few days.  The increased functionality and screen changes are important, and the look and feel re-design is low cost.  We need some good news for our customers anyway.  The attached presentation shows what it will look like and details some of the changes.  

Let me know what you think and hang in there, Louise.

Brad
