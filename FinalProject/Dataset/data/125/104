I received another call from Robert Minkoff on Friday, 11/09.  His company is interested in purchasing EPMI's claim in the PCA bankruptcy.  I know that we have filed a claim for $1million plus, but that PCA had filed an adversary for an even larger amount.  Your reply to my last e-mail indicates that we settled the adversary.  Did we have to give up all or part of our claim to do that, or do we still hold a claim for any amount?  If we still have a claim, do you have any interest in selling it to a claims broker.  If not, let me know so that I can call him and tell him so that he will not continue to call.  Thanks for your help!

I received a call this morning from Robert Minkoff.  His company is interested in buying EPMI's claim in the PCA bankruptcy.  I have not had any involvement in the PCA matter for quite some time, so I told him that I would pass along his name and number to someone who might know whether EPMI has any interest in selling its claim.  His telephone number is 201-968-0001.

Thanks.
