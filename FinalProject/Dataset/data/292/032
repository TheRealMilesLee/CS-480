Maybe she will grow out of it!  Sorry I have not been in touch lately.  It
has been sort of hecktic.  Life should begin to fall back into a pattern
within the next week or so.  I want to see a picture.  How does it feel to
be a Daddy?  How is Ingrid?  Hope you are all doing well.  You too Uncle
Jerry and Barbara.

I have some really bad news.  My little girl, when she makes a frown face,
she looks just like her Uncle Jerry.  I think that's a very bad sign.

She weighs 7 lbs 4 ozs as of today.
