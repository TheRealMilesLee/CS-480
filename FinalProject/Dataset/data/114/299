1.  We are adding the following paragraph to the exit letters for the group.  
Outplacement Services
Enron has contracted with Spherion, a leader in outplacement consulting and career transition with 51 offices nationwide.  The Career Transition Program includes the utilization of Spherion's Career Planning Model Methodology which encompasses the completion of a career analysis, broadcast letters and resume, interview training and the development of an individual marketing plan.  A career consultant is assigned to work with the candidate for the duration of the program.  Candidates may also attend on-going sessions for Internet training, library research tips, financial planning and other career-related topics.  Individualized job search coaching and consultation are also provided.  If you have an interest in participating in this program, please notify me and I will make arrangements for a Spherion consultant to contact you.  The program may be initiated as soon as possible, but no later than one month after your termination date.

The program for administrative staff is a 1-month program @ $3,000 -- the program for the professional staff is a 3-month program @ $5,000.
QUESTION 1:  Do I add this to Bessie Hiler's package?
QUESTION 2:  Donna Fulton has already been working with an independent career planning consultant and would like to continue.  Can she just invoice us (up to $5,000) and continue to use her?  (I've not indicated to her an amount)   I'm OK with it if you are.
QUESTION 3:  Do you want these costs accrued this year as well?

2.  Is it OK to send Bessie her package?  I'll have them all complete and ready to overnight tomorrow so they will have in their hands by Monday.

3.  Vacation payouts won't be paid until 1/15/02 for everyone except Lisa.  Do you want these costs accrued this year as well?

Thanks for your help.  Looks like we'll get this pretty well wrapped up tomorrow.  I'll keep you posted.
Jo Ann
