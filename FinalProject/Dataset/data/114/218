Ken, I know you have a million things going on, but I was just going to mention that I'm spending the week-end of November 9th with Keith Bailey at his house in Tulsa.  If there is anything you want me to discuss with him, please advise.  Take care and good luck on bringing Enron back to the place where we belong in the Industry, i.e. Number 1!  Norm
