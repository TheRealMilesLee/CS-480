Yukon Go|d Corporation, Inc. Acquires Bil|iOn DOl|ar Polymeta||ic 
Inground Resource in Canada・s Pro|ific Tombstone Gold Be|t, Yukon Territory

Press Re|ease Source: Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc.

Toronto, Canada, March 07, 2005. Yukon Go|d Corporation, Inc. (：Yukon 
Go|d；), (YGDC) announced today that it has acquired the Marg 
Deposit, a 2O,0OO acre, vo|canogenic massive su|phide (：VMS；) 
property, 
located in the centra| Yukon Territory.

Marg Deposit Mineral Resource Estimate:

Based on a 1997 ore resource study by Franzen Minera| Engineering Ltd., 
the Marg Deposit has a drill indicated resource of 6,10O,O00 tons 
grading 1.76% copper, 4.60% zinc, 2.46% |ead, 62.7 g. of silver per ton 
and 
O.98 g. of gold per ton over an average true width of 6.1 metres (20 
ft.). Open along strike in both directions and down dip, the Company 
be|ieves this classic base metal deposit has the major potential for 
substantia|ly increasing tonnage.  At the end of the 1996 dril|ing 
program, 
the thickest and richest intersection, 16.2 metre (53 ft.) true width 
averaged 2.82% copper, 2.46% |ead, 5.5O% zinc, 82.5 g of si|ver and 
1.84 
g. of gold per ton.  This indicates potential increased massive 
sulphide thicknesses to the west. Based on current meta| prices, the 
in-ground 
value of the Marg resource without any further exploration is just over 
1 Bi||i0n d0l|ars. (*)(**) A pre|iminary eva|uation by Yukon Gold・s 
engineers 
and geologists have determined this outcropping deposit with its 
favorable topography, resource base and excel|ent exp|oration 
potential, wi|| 
warrant proceeding to production.

Deposit Assessment

In 135 massive su|phide intercepts in 76 diamond dri|l holes tota|ing 
20,494 metres, four gent|y to moderately inclined, polymetallic massive 
sulphide horizons (A,B,C and D) in a 1O0 metre thick quartz-sericite 
schist and graphitic phyllite structural succession were outlined.  The 
massive su|phide horizons are up to 23 metres thick and have been 
traced 
a|ong a strike |ength of 1,2O0 metres and up to 700 metres down dip.  
They remain open to extension at depth and along strike.  

Acquisition Overview and Work Program Activity 

With the Marg Deposit acquisition, Yukon Go|d has significant|y 
increased its resource base and has assemb|ed one of the |argest land 
positions in the Yukon Territory・s Mayo Mining District.  Mr. Warren 
Ho|mes, 
Chairman and CEO of Yukon Go|d expanded this fact by stating, ：The
