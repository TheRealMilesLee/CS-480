Just got off the phone with Rick Hawley--Puget's CFO.  He was very cordial and indicated the company was interested in talking with us.  We had a fairly open discussion of who we should contact.  In the end, he suggested that we call Bill Gaines, VP Energy Supply.  He said that as CFO he is head of the Risk Management Committee and that anything that was discussed with Bill would go through his committee.  I highlighted the notion that we were interested in talking about services that could be helpful to their risk management efforts and that would be beneficial to both of our companies.  

By the way, at the beginning of the call, I made clear that we were not talking about total outsourcing.  

He didn't immediately respond, but in the context of our discussion re:  who to talk to he stated that we should talk to him if we wanted to have a more strategic discussion on outsourcing.  Then he said something to the effect of "of course, we're not at all interested in a more comprehensive outsourcing product."

Bill's number is 425.462.3145.  He said that we can tell Bill, Rick suggested we call him directly.
