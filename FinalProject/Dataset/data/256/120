We need to be prepared to purchase energy to cover West power April shorts. I propose we make purchases Tuesday AM. Are we comfortable that we know exactly what MWhrs must be covered by location? The issue, as always, is that money cannot be wired to the counterparties until detailed cash requests, including back-up (As prepared by Mo for March) is presented to the cash committee.

Mike/Matt: Are we jeopardizing our ability to effectively cover April if we wait to purchase on Wednesday AM (since Mo is out today)? I know AEP was concerned about our late buying for March. Please advise.

Thanks.
