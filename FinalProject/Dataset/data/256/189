Looking at the Master Termination log, there are three CPs that do not show as terminated.  Can you please update me on what you need me to do to complete these?

The companies are:

Farmland Industries, Inc.
Hess Energy Services Corp. (contract assumed by Amereda Hess)
Great Lakes Chemical Corporation (probably still being reviewed)

Please advise.
