   Word of the Day for Tuesday March 26, 2002:

   ratiocination \rash-ee-ah-suh-NAY-shun; rash-ee-oh-\, noun:
   The process of reasoning.

     For  all  their  vaunted  powers  of  ratiocination,  grand
     masters of chess tend to be a skittery lot.
     --"People," [1]Time, October 26, 1987

     The adventures of Sherlock Holmes proved so popular that it
     became  a  given that mystery tales should include a sleuth
     who  investigates a murder or other crime, and by virtue of
     intelligence,  ratiocination and perseverance solves a case
     that initially seemed unsolvable.
     --Maxim  Jakubowski, "A beginner's guide to crime fiction,"
     [2]The Guardian, October 29, 1999

     There   is   no  question  that  Joyce  and  Nabokov. . .
     brilliantly  explored  and  expanded the limits of language
     and the structure of novels, yet both were led irresistibly
     and  obsessively  to  cap their careers with those cold and
     lifeless  masterpieces, "Finnegans Wake" and "Ada," more to
     be  deciphered  than  read  by  a handful of scholars whose
     pleasure is strictly ratiocination.
     --"How   I   Learned  To  Stop  Worrying  And  Love  'Barry
     Lyndon,' " [3]New York Times, January 11, 1976
     _________________________________________________________

   Ratiocination  is  from Latin rationcinatio, from ratiocinari,
   "to compute, to calculate, to reason," from ratio, "reckoning,
   calculation, reason," from reri, "to reckon, to think."
