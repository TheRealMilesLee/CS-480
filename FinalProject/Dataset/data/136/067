Thane,

There must be some miscommunication.  I just talked with John and he

knows that an OOME instruction is necessary to get energy from OOMC

capacity.  It is not required by the protocols to bid in to balancing

market as is Replacement.  That causes us some operation problems and we

may ask for that requirement to be applied to OOMC as well.

Importance: High


I have a follow up question on our discussion at the TAC meeting last

week.  As we discussed, an OOMC instruction for hours 0-24 at 50MW would

for example require a unit to be prepared to provide the 50MW, but not

to actually provide the energy.  Another unit specific instruction or

OOME would be required for the unit to actually run at 50MW.

As recent as this morning, we were told that ERCOT would provide us an

OOME instruction when they want us to run after an OOMC instruction.

However, they also said that we were operating outside the protocols due

to John Adams' interpretation that when we receive an OOMC for a certain

time period at a certain level we should be generating.

We need immediate clarification on this issue.
