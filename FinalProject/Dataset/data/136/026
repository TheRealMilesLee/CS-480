Hey handsome, hope you're feeling a little better today.  You sounded awful 
last night.  Thanks for being a friend, I really enjoy spending time with 
you.  Can't wait to start working and keeping my days busy.  Bob is supposed 
to fly in this morning, so I'm sure it'll be more "serious" talks.  I hate 
serious stuff....ugh!  Keep in touch and don't break too many hearts, you 
big stud!
