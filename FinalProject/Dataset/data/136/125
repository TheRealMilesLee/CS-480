Debra Ceffalio from Governor Knowles' office called and extended invitation to attend breakfast meeting on Friday, November 30th from 8:00 - 9:30 in Alaska.  The invitation included Danny and Eric. Debra mentioned that Danny and Eric could invite others that were involved in the MOU.  
Danny will not be attending and I have advised Debra.  I also advised Debra that you were out of the office this week and you would repsonse on Monday regarding your attendance.
