Brandon,
Thanks so much!  Would you please put a blurb about Enron Kids in the New and Notable section as well??  Is there a way to have "Sponsor a child this holiday season ..." and then have it link to the below info on the CR page?  Let me know what you think ...
Misha

Enron Kids is a volunteer program with the sole purpose of helping under-privileged school children.

 For each of the last 15 years, we have chosen an HISD elementary school and offered to "sponsor" every child in that school.  What we mean by "sponsor" is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.  The presents are then handed out to the children at their Holiday Party in December.  For most of these kids, it is their only present this holiday season.

How do you do this?  From November 26 - 30, Enron employees and contractors select a child to sponsor from pictures displayed in Enron Center North (cafeteria level).  .  You, as a sponsor, will receive specific colors and sizes along with a "Dear Special Friend" letter written by the child.  Then the "sponsor" provides a complete outfit, book and toy for this child; it costs an average of $100 to sponsor a child.

We know the last few months have been very difficult for Enron and its employees; but remember, we still have more today than most of these kids ever will! 

To help defray the cost, most sponsors participate in teams with other department employees.   Department and Team Leaders-challenge your group to sponsor a child (we have 450 kids this year).  The record for any one Team stands at 22.  

If you can't sponsor a child, you can still participate by making a donation to the Committee.  Anyone who makes a donation of $25 or more receives an Enron Kids T-shirt.  Also, for this year, the Committee is eliminating the shoes and jacket requirement.


Thanks for your support!!
The Enron Kids Committee

I put it in the New & Notable; people aren't visiting the CR site as much lately.
