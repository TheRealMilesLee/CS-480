LeShawn Edwards, currently a contractor in Elaine Concklin's accounting group, has accepted a position with Barney Brasher to fill the position vacated by Vera Jones, and Elaine has hired another contractor to backfill the position LeShawn is leaving.

I need your approval to switch the telephones:

LeShawn's phone from 3AC3321 to her new location at 3AC3336
Vera Jones' old phone from 3AC3336 to 3AC3321 & reassign to new contractor

If you approve, please forward to Rod Hayslett for his approval as well.

Thank you.
