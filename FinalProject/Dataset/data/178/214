          Attached is version 5 of the cover memo, as redlined from prior version.  Your comments and suggestions are appreciated.  John, I rearranged your second paragraph, because I didn't want our ability to disclose the agreement to potential counterparties to be limited by our satisfying the conditions outlined below.  I hope that works.

If you need to reach me, I am at home at 713-218-7155, or on my cell at 713-302-5522.
 
Thanks for your thoughts and comments. 
 
Michelle
