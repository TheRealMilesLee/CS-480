I just turned on the computer and read all of these "bad news" notes.  I just wanted to second Ben's comments: this vandalism is horrible.  But as we have discussed in the past, we should not label this an "East Montrose" problem - this probably happened all over the area.  Most Montrose neighborhoods have a very unfortunate layout (with respect to theft and vandalism) - almost every street is a cross street, so that people can get in and out of the neighborhood very easily.  

This has been discussed with the Mayor's office in past years, but the "need for alternate routes out of downtown" so far has overshadowed issues such as this.

For those of you who were vandalized recently, if you have not reported this to the police, please do so.  It may not seem significant enough right now, but for talks about blocking off streets to resume, documentation about the problems we are having will be essential.

I hope your holidays were wonderful, and wish each of you the best in 2002.

Amy Barnes

  We had the rear window of a friend's minivan smashed Friday night (Dec 21) between 7 and 9pm outside 607 Peden.

    Neighbors, yesterday four cars were vandalized at Bomar St. The  glass windows were shatered. My cousin from Michigan was visiting me. The window behind the driver's seat was broken. The police was at Bomar and Grant with the same problem. I am sick and tired of this abuse. And yesterday I was also ashamed. It's not only the broken glass is all the secondary effects that this kind of incidents cause to the victim. And the perpetrators are probably laughing at all of us. Because for them is probably a joke. I am sorry of giving all of you this news in this beautiful day but we need to be aware. Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Hedda, 416 Bomar.
