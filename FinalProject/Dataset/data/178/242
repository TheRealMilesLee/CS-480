      <P align=left><FONT face=Arial size=2>This University Degree Program 
      removes the obstacles that cause adults to abandon all hope. You may know 
      employers continually hire, promote and reward raises to new 
      employees.&nbsp; They may have ZERO skills or experience, but they are 
      continually promoted just because they have this piece of 
paper.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Arial size=2>The degree earned by our students 
      enables them to qualify for career advancement and personal growth.&nbsp; 
      This acclamation also breaks down the walls that prevents you from 
      receiving the more fulfillment and proper compensation.&nbsp;<BR><BR>With 
      our service, you are provided with an official graded transcript. 
      Duplicate transcripts will be filed in the graduate's permanent record 
      with our colleges. Degree verification and official transcripts will be 
      provided in writing when requested by employers and others authorized by 
      the graduate. Our College and University transcripts meet the highest 
      academic standards. Our University issues a degree printed on a premium 
      diploma paper, bearing the official gold raised college seal.</FONT></P>
