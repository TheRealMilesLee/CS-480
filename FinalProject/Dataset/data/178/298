Hey Deskmates,

Before I toodle off to Denver and my bones grace a few ski slopes I figured I would tell you guys what Eric Serio told me when I was doing the first MDEA nightly checkout thingie. 

I was given to understand that the whole idea behind these EES nitely checkouts for MDEA was that the Services application as well as OATI/scheduling/Daily checkout to agree. However after a couple of conversations with Mike we both reached the inescapable conclusion that not all of us are on the same page as far as MDEA checkouts go. This I hope will help rid of that problem.

My understanding is as follows: 
1. OATI's 'Actual MW' and Services 'Actual Net Tie' have to agree. 
2. OATI's 'Inadvertent' row under daily checkout and Services' "Imbalance' especially have to agree.
3. The above 2 would automatically agree if OATI is functioning properly and picks up MW numbers from the tags (which however has not been the case in the past 4 days)
4. Once the MDEA fax arrives and is synchronized with Services, hit "Edit Actual-MW values" in OATI : Daily checkout under shceduling. Put in the same values as the MDEA fax (system load) and the synchronized Services' " Actual Net Tie" (which should by now agree with System Load of the MDEA fax). 
5. Hit "Apply". Now OATI and Services should agree on "Actual-MW values" and "Actual Net Tie". They should also agree on "Inadvertent" and "Imbalance" respectively. (If not, Eric told me there was a procedure by where one could build a dummy tag just to make OATI agree (apparently they have had this problem before , since they have a solution for it) but assured me that we would not need to worry about that).
6. After this go through the normal procedure explained in the night desk duties email. 

This is only my understanding of it and might be completely flawed. However I think there might be some merit to it since we fax over the Net Tie report and the printouts of our OATI(scheduled and next day) to EES. The reason being that they can check on their OATI and see if they agree or not. (I also assume that they do not have a similar Services application as ours since that would obviate the need for OATI checkouts). Which, again is why it is so imperative that our Services and OATI agree. 

Lastly, in case I am horribly wrong on the above and someone decides to take it up to instruct me for the better, I shall be available at 303-693-1965 for the remainder of my holiday and on 720-320-4270 for 24/7.

Happy New Year to all of you and your families. May the new year bring more certainty and better fortune for all of us.

Adios, for now,

Punit.
