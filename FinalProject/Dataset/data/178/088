Hi Jim-
 
Will be back first thing Monday AM and will come up then...I came up b/f I left and saw some piles, but I didn't want to rifle through everyone's stuff.  
 
Thanks,
Suzanne

When you get back from the Holidays, please stop by 47 and help go through the Gas cases Becky had intervened in.  

Thanks, 

Jim
