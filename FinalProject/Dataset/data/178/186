I wish I had more time to review this.  Of 62 different elements of the audit, PwC found the CAISO to be "non-compliant" with 31 elements, e.g., no operating procedure, or, more often, in direct violation of the tariff.  Lots of problems were found with the CAISO actual operation in dispatching real time energy, dealing with CERS, and setting the ex post price.---sch
