attached please find two agreements - a draft of a mutual services agmt and an employment agmt.  These are drafts to stimulate discussion and comments.  They need to be cleaned up and tightened and in some cases filled in entirely.  There may well be significant changes in approach so do not become too caught up in the minor matters

Let me and Colleen know your thgts....

Have a great Christmas
