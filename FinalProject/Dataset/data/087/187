As you may be aware, we have experienced delays in completing our latest release of the Sunrise Financial Data Warehouse, which will include AP/AR and earnings information. We are now doing our final quality checks and expect that the new content and standard reports will be available no later than November 1.

You will soon be receiving a communication with instructions on how to utilize the new features. If you have any questions please contact ISC customer care at 713-345-4727.
