by SI's Peter King	

After I, along with most of the western world, declared the Broncos the favorites in the AFC West this fall, they've now been beaten to the kind of Gerry Cooney pulp that makes their top-flight status quite shaky. They're the third-highest scoring team in their own division, for crying out loud. (San Diego 132, Oakland 131, Denver 123.) And quarterback Brian Griese has a bum throwing shoulder; he has far less zip on the ball. Trouble, with a capital T, especially now that he has to play without Ed McCaffrey. Even though the Chargers have lost two straight weeks on the road to beatable Cleveland and New England, you have to like their chances to win at a fever-pitched Qualcomm. I like Doug Flutie to play big in a big game. Flutie and new offensive coordinator Norv Turner have made some beautiful music together in the first third of the season, which is pretty remarkable considering this is about the 64th offense Flutie's had to learn since leaving Boston College. "It's tou! gh! when you have to keep learning new offenses,'' Flutie tells me, "but you have to wipe the slate clean and start fresh. A lot of guys carry some baggage when they go from one place to another. You say, We used to to do it this way, or call it such and such, and you think of it in those terms. But you have to erase that. I've been pretty good at doing that. And the bottom line here is, I believe in Norv Turner, and I will try to do it his way. It's worked well so far."

What You Need to Know by SI's Peter King
  <http://i.cnn.net/si/email/pro_football_extra/images/black1x1.gif>


1. Butch Davis believes just what his old boss in Dallas, Jimmy Johnson, believes when it comes to draft choices. In jettisoning a player they were not using prominently, defensive lineman Stalin Colinet, to Minnesota, the Browns upgraded a seventh-round draft pick to a fifth-rounder. Now Cleveland has the most picks in the 2002 draft, 10, of any team in the league but expansion Houston.

2. With the No. 1 pick in next April's draft, Houston likely will not reach for either of the two top-tier quarterbacks available, Oregon's Joey Harrington and Fresno State's David Carr. My sleeper picks for the Texans' Opening Day QB: Shane Matthews or that kid with the Texas name and California 'tude, Cade McNown.

3. Good for Mike Holmgren. He's not wavering on putting Matt Hasselbeck back in the lineup next week at Miami. Here's the thing with the Seahawks' QB situation: You'll never find the upside of Hasselbeck unless you play him. Remember, it was late in Brett Favre's second year as a starter when assistant coaches on the Green Bay staff urged Holmgren to yank him. Hasselbeck needs time, even with the pennant race on the line.

4. Underrated Defensive Player of the Year so far: Pittsburgh rookie linebacker Kendrell Bell, a force as an inside and outside player. He has 20 tackles and three sacks in his last three games. And doesn't that make the Cowboys sick. This was the player Jerry Jones bypassed to select Quincy Carter, trumping the Dallas draft board.

Unsung Heroes
  <http://i.cnn.net/si/email/pro_football_extra/images/black1x1.gif>
by CNNSI.com's Pat Kirwan 	

Wide receiver Hines Ward was supposed to watch two first-round draft picks take over starting roles at his position in Pittsburgh. But Plaxico Burress and Troy Edwards haven't developed the way Ward has. In the past two weeks he has caught 12 balls for 106 yards and a touchdown. Meanwhile, backup running back Amos Zereoue has been giving the Steelers a change of pace when Jerome Bettis has needed a break. In the last two games, Zereoue has rushed 16 times for 102 yards. In my book, that makes him a productive player behind the scenes and a guy a number of teams would start if they had him on their roster.

by CNNSI.com's James Quintong 

It looks like it's safe to play Terry Glenn after he had a huge game against the Chargers on Sunday. He could be in for another big effort as the Patriots take on the Colts. The Indianapolis defense is still very spotty, allowing New England to put up 44 points in Week 3. Glenn's return could help the value of Tom Brady, who you might want to pick up if you're desperate for quarterback help.

Tim Biakabutuka hasn't had much of a season so far, but this could be the week to play him as the Panthers take on the Redskins, who have the worst run defense in the NFL. In fact, until proven otherwise, any decent running back playing Washington that week will be a recommended play.
