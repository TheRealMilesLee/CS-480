                     Energy Commission Begins Review
               Process for Three Proposed Power Plants 


       Sacramento - At a business meeting last night, the California Energy Commission accepted into the licensing
       process applications for three new power plants. These projects will now begin a comprehensive staff review.

       Roseville Energy Facility
       A 900-megawatt power plant in the Sacramento area is being proposed by Roseville Energy Facility, LLC, a
       wholly owned subsidiary of Enron North America Corporation. The combined cycle, natural gas-fired facility
       is planned for a site five miles north of downtown Roseville and one-tenth of a mile north of the Pleasant Grove
       Wastewater Treatment Plant.

       The Roseville Energy Facility will be considered under the Energy Commission's 12-month review process
       following last night's 4 to 0 vote by Energy Commissioners. The Committee that will oversee that review is
       comprised of Energy Commissioner Robert Laurie as Presiding Member, and Commission Chairman William
       Keese as Associate Member.

       More information on the Roseville Energy Facility is available on the Energy Commission web site at:

                                   www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/roseville

       Tracy Peaker Project
       As proposed by GWF Energy, LLC, this 169-megawatt, simple cycle power plant would be built in an
       unincorporated part of San Joaquin County, adjacent to the Delta-Mendota Canal on the southwest and the
       Union Pacific railroad to the north.

       Energy Commissioners voted 5 to 0 that the Tracy Peaker Project could begin review under the Energy
       Commission's four-month process. The facility will not be converted to a combined-cycle facility later, due to
       the requirements of a 10-year contract to sell electricity to the California Department of Water Resources
       (DWR).

       Energy Commissioner Robert Pernell was named Presiding Member of the committee reviewing the Tracy
       Peaker Project. Commissioner Robert Laurie will serve as Associate Member.

       More information on the Tracy Peaker Project is available on the Energy Commission web site at:

                                 www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/tracypeaker 

       Henrietta Peaker Project
       GWF Energy, LLC, is also applying for a license to build and operate the Henrietta Peaker Project. The project
       site is adjacent to the PG&E Henrietta substation, 20 miles south of Hanford in an unincorporated part of
       Kings County. The proposed plant would consist of two turbine generators in simple-cycle mode, delivering
       91.4 megawatts, and a 70-kilovolt switchyard. 

       After last night's 5 to 0 vote, Henrietta enters the Commission's four-month review process. Like the Tracy
       project, this facility has an existing 10-year DWR contract that calls for the plant to remain a simple-cycle
       peaking facility. 

       The Committee for the Henrietta Peaker Project consists of Arthur H. Rosenfeld as Presiding Member and
       Commissioner Michal (spelled correctly) Moore as Associate Member.

       More information on the Henrietta Peaker Project is available on the Energy Commission web site at:

                                   www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/henrietta

       Public participation is a very important part of the Energy Commission review process. To find out how to get
