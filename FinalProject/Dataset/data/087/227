If we have not located any dealmaker interested in this counterparty can we close out this counterparty and get it out of the work cue?

It sounds like we may not need to follow up with this counterparty.  Any dealmaker interested in business with them?  If not, I think we should just inactivate them.

This Cp was primarily interest in price discovery and was going to consider whether to pursue EOL access.  I informed them that if they want EOL access, I need documentation re municipal authority.  They never followed up with me.
