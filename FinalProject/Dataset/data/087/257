We got crazy at Cool River.  Smokin Cigars, drinking heavily...there was even a little spanking going on!  You missed it, man.  Still up in the air about Halloween.  What's the fun single thing to do?

Hey, welcome back.  Sorry I missed you last night.  I was down in Cherry Creek having some drinks with friends, and didn't hear my phone.  Hope you had fun.
