Of course I remember you and I thank you for your response. Please let Greg 
know I contacted him and my cell phone # is 513-509-1625, should he get a 
chance to call. Otherwise just let him know I'll try and get with him next 
week as our conversation isn't time sensitive.

Congratulations to you as well and I'm sure things are busier than ever.

Regards,

Michael
