You've been selected to be part of a small group to
review our new premium service, VentureWire Professional,
the market-leading information service in private equity
and venture capital.

Unless you tell us otherwise, now, your no-risk,
no-obligation, two-week free trial of VentureWire
Professional will start on Monday.
http://alert.venturewire.com/no_thanks.asp?i=NQNKQLMILP

I'm sure you've noticed that our original service,
VentureWire, has become two separate services:
VentureWire Professional, which has all the deals,
every day, and all the exclusive details you've come
to depend on; and VentureWire Alert, a free, simplified
service for those with a general interest in private
capital markets.

VentureWire Professional is delivered to you every
morning via e-mail, and provides even more valuable
tools, analysis, and data via the Web site
http://professional.venturewire.com

The service also brings you the most comprehensive,
searchable deal database of its kind, with more than
24,000 financings and other industry events, and can
be searched and sorted the way you analyze the market
-- by company, sector, type of financing, industry,
and region.

To start the free trial on Monday to VentureWire
Professional, do nothing. Here are your other options:

Subscribe:
I'll sign up for VentureWire Professional at the
Charter Discount rate.

No Thanks:
I'll stay with my free VentureWire Alert subscription.
Don't send me the free trial to VentureWire Pro at
this time.
http://alert.venturewire.com/no_thanks.asp?i=NQNKQLMILP

During your trial, we'll be sending you a few notes to
explain some of the most useful features and benefits of
VentureWire Professional. Click the link if you're
interested in learning more about our significant
discounts for multiple subscriptions.

I look forward to having you as a subscriber.
