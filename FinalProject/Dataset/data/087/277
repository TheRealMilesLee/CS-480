Generally OK given the alternatives but need clarification on certain
issues.  Is this just a Bilas thing or are the votes there to get it passed
even with the modifications?

Lad,

What does this do to the BCAP filing?

Folks:
Before filing comments on Bilas' proposal to modify our settlement with
SoCal and vote it out on the 25th, I wanted to get a sense of how folks
feel about it generally.  Hope all is well.

Best,
Jeff
