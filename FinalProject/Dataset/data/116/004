I have made a few "clean-up" changes to the Financial Adoption Agreement and incorporated some comments from Carol.

Please use the attached version for any Financial deals.  Thaks

I have reviewed the attached draft with Anne, Travis and Marcus.  For purposes of maintaining consistency between the 3 disciplines, I would appreciate your using the attached for any further ISDA Adoption Agreements you may have.  Anne's suggested Item 7 to Scheule B should cut down your due diligence workload appreciably regaring the various places that Affiliate is used in the Master. 

The main change from the draft Anne sent out yesterday evening is that it "reinserts" the Schedule C with Credit information.

Please call with any question.
