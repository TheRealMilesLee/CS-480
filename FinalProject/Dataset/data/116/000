Kay,

We found the bankruptcy proceeding for The Phone Company - it was filed
in Delaware, Case no. 98-01881.  For some reason, the Delaware
bankruptcy docket is one of the few federal dockets that are not
available on the PACER system.  I'm checking with bankruptcy legal
assistants as to the cost of getting a copy of the Delaware docket.

Regards,
Sherry

Here's what I got from Eric on the lease.  The numbers don't seem to
match, but we won't worry about that now.

The Nortel RTU info is supposed to be here by Wednesday. 

Sherry, please make the few changes to the draft equipment lease Tammy
previously prepared to incorporate the new terms.  To the extent
necessary, just bracket any questions you have, especially commercial
questions.  We won't tackle the security agreement or the license
agreement yet. Just send the revised lease to me (not Eric yet).

Please see if you can find the bankruptcy proceeding.  If the docs
aren't available on line, please get back to me before incurring any
additional expense.  I don't want to spend a lot of money on this until
things become a bit more clear.  

Thanks,

Kay

Here it is.  As mentioned, I have not seen an executed copy, and there
may not be one.

TPC is a Delaware corp. HQ'd in Danbury, CT.  Would that mean the Ch. 11
was filed in Delaware?

Eric
