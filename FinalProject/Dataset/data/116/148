Hi Louise,
Can you please provide some guidance? Originally what we prepared for you has been an origination schedule each month. As you know, we've since added MPR items. Several commercial folks are now requesting that we add in accrual items. Are you okay with this?

Would you like to see two schedules each month- one with only true originations, then an additional report that includes originations, MPR, and accrual items?

Faith,  

I have differences with Canada on the Originations schedule due to accrual income items.  I have not included the accrual income on the Originations schedule for Louise.  Please advise.	


 
Please note that the spreadsheet has 4 tabs and the discrepancies are highlighted in pink.

Thanks.

Have a Great Day,
