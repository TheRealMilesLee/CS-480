Hey Mom, I know you remember Uncle Mike's quotation from PopPop's
funeral...A girl I know has it on her instant messenger with a little
change, and I like her version a lot, too. Hers is: "Work like you don't
need the money, love like you've never been hurt, and dance like no one is
watching." Just something more to think about (as if we don't have enough!).

Love,

Paige
