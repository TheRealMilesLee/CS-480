Profile <br>
&nbsp; <br>
First National Power Corporation is a developer of renewable energy to meet the growing demand for clean, renewable sources of power. First National's focus is on green power, the most rapidly growing source of electricity generation in the world. The team of experienced professionals at First National brings together a full range of project development, technical, financial, and marketing skills to design, construct, and operate wind power facilities. <br>
<br>
Urban Power Generation <br>
<br>
First National's focus is to become a power company by entering into long term agreements with building owners who will buy their electricity from First National Power, and will also be able to participate in the profit generated by selling excess power back into the electricity grid. <br>
<br>
First National Power Corporation will own and maintain all power generating facilities, which will be located on their customers’ buildings. Although First National does not intend to sell its technology, licensing will be available in other countries on a profit sharing basis. <br>
<br>
This will not only result in a much needed load reduction on the grid, but it will also reward both building owners and Capstone with valuable Carbon Credits and Federal price incentives. <br>
<br>
<br>
Rural Power Generation <br>
<br>
Prop-less technology will also give us an edge in conventional 'Wind Farm' power generation projects. A prop-less wind power generator will have no bird kill and, therefore, reduce the environmental study process. Removing the propeller has also addressed a very significant problem faced today in all wind generating systems using propellers. The propeller is responsible for 70 to 80 percent of the maintenance requirements which create downtime, loss of revenue, as well as high maintenance costs. All of these factors add significantly to the cost of generating wind power. The propeller has also been known to cause problems for Air Force radar systems such as in a recently halted $130 million wind project, near Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Technology <br>
&nbsp; <br>
First National Power has bought the rights to inventor Alvin Snaper’s propeller less wind-powered turbine. Snaper, who invented the IBM Selectric typewriter ball, Tang, orange flavored drink, and hundreds of other industrial innovations that have made him famous in the mining and metallurgical circles, is an integral part of our organization. <br>
<br>
<br>
This technology breakthrough will allow First National to become a major participant in the emerging green energy industry with an innovative appliance that will open an as-of-yet untapped market. Federal, state, and municipal laws, regulations, and building restrictions prohibit high-rise building owners from placing windmills on top of their buildings. The innovative design of our Prop-less wind turbine will make it possible for us to tap into this huge multi-billion dollar market and capitalize on a truly sustainable competitive advantage. <br>
<br>

&nbsp; <br>
International Market for Green Energy <br>
&nbsp; <br>
First National's focus is to become a power company by entering into long term agreements with According to a EU report to the European Conferences on Green Energy held during March 2004, in Lousanne Switzerland, over 2.5 million Europeans are now using electricity generated from renewable sources. Solar energy, wind energy, biomass, hydropower, and geothermal are all forms of renewable energy, which are green and sustainable. Their use is growing and the contribution made to reducing global warming and combating climate change is increasingly important. Green Energy production has come of age and we believe that continued growth potential for this segment of the industry is certain. <br>
<br>

&nbsp; <br>
Wind Energy &amp; Prop-Less Wind Turbine <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Wind is the world's fastest-growing energy source. Cumulative global wind energy generating capacity topped 31,000 megawatts (MW) in 2002 and has continued to rise. Some 6,868 MW of new capacity came into production worldwide during 2002, an increase of 28%, according to preliminary estimates by the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) and the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA). Wind plants now power the equivalent of 7.5 million average American homes (16 million average European homes) worldwide. Global wind power generating capacity has quadrupled over the past five years, growing from 7,600 MW at the end of 1997 to an estimated 31,128 MW at the end of 2002 – an increase of over 23,000 MW. Wind is the world’s fastest-growing energy source on a percentage basis, with installed generating
capacity increasing by an average of 32% annually between the years 1998-2002. The slightly slower rate of 28% in 2002 was primarily due to a lull in the U.S. market and is rebounding with the improved economy. <br>
<br>
"Wind energy grew by 10% in the United States in 2002, a good performance given the poor state of the U.S. energy market and the stop-and-go-and-stop-again policy signals directed at our industry," said AWEA executive director Randall Swisher. Swisher added, "with steady supportive policies, wind power could grow at a sustained pace closer to that of Europe, and provide well over 6% of U.S. electricity by 2020." <br>
<br>
<br>
For many Americans, compact wind turbine technology offers the most immediate near term hope of generating their own electricity from clean sustainable renewable resources. Millions of homeowners, farmers, apartment owners and small business operators dream of the day they have the freedom to choose how their electricity is produced and what environmental impacts their consumption generates. Americans and people from other developed countries want freedom of choice. However, choice is not something that over 2 billion people around the world have. For them, there is no choice. They do not have access to electric energy from any source. <br>
EWEA chief executive Corin Millais stated, "This is just the tip of the iceberg; the global wind power market could be worth euro 25 billion a year by 2010. Wind power currently meets 2% of total European electricity demand. That share will increase rapidly as the technology continues to develop, costs continue to fall, and the need to secure and diversify energy supply becomes increasingly evident to decision makers." <br>

The Green Oasis <br>
&nbsp; <br>
The Green Oasis ™ is just what its name suggests. An oasis of services providing direct and stored green energy, water purification, Internet, and telephony connections via satellite. The mobile unit is designed to go anywhere on a temporary or permanent basis. It can become the local utility to support or become the principal source of survival in times of disaster. Each unit can be customized or individualized. It is a modular format to custom fit the environment in which it will be deployed, thus allowing maximum utilization. The units will carry pre-charged portable battery modules that will allow emergency workers and others to transport electricity to specific areas on an "as needed" basis. The Green Oasis ™ and its power satellite units will hit the ground running as they are deployed
fully charged and "ready to go". <br>
