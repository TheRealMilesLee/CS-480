Hello.  Your account has been corporately billed to Enron since 09/20/01.  There is, however, a balanced owed for the final bill under your personal liability for the same number.  We can transfer the entire balance owed to your corporate account with Enron's approval.  Please let us know.  Also, your Assignment & Assumption paperwork indicates that you want the corporate invoices sent to your home address.  If you indeed would like your EID number incorporated to your account for the "I Buy It" accounts payable system with Enron, then you will no longer receive paper invoices at home.  These invoices are paid directly on line by Enron Accounts Payable and they receive the invoices at a specific post office box.  Please let me us know what you decide and we can change your account information for you.  Thank you.
