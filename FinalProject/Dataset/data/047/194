I will check with Cara Sempberger regarding the Services deal type. Regarding the profit sharing, the services desk enters annuities with the appropriate counterparty or other trading desk to capture that p/l.

You should check with Scheduling re: the deal type because they are the ones who requested it be set up (I think).  Regarding the services desk, what type of profit sharing do we have with the counterparties they are doing business for?  It differs by deal.  I just want to make sure we know how they are capturing the deals when it is a profit sharing arrangement.

Nobody here uses that deal type. It is not even possible to bring it up in the deal types area when you are searching for specific deals. As far as the services book goes, they have only done fwds, a few index fwd deals and the odd transmission deal. We treat that book just as we do the others in ensuring accurate p/l. They don't do anything unusual that would make me question the accuracy. The only problem of any significance is PMA adjustments for some of their backdated deals and deals that had liquidated in other books before the Services desk was set up.

John,

Please send me an e-mail highlighting who uses the Services deal type, for what deals, where all these deals show up, trouble with the deal type and anything else you find out about them.  Also, highlight for me the transactions in the Services desk and what our group does to ensure that the right p&l is recorded for Enron.

Thanks,
Stacey
