Barbara, Brian Redmond told me you may me able to help.  Hugh Connett w/ Bridgeline has a customer who is interested in having us construct a pipeline interconnect/meter on their behalf.  Bridgeline will be reimbursed for the costs, ownership of the asset in this case will remain w/ Bridgeline.  Hugh called and asked if we might have an example contract for this type of deal. Do you have anything?
