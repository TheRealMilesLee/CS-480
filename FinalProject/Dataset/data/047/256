The following email was sent earlier today regarding the Reliant RFP for
10% of its Price to Beat load.  We received your email back due to the size
of the file.  We have reconfigured "appendix b" and attached it below as
"special appendix b" so that the size of the file would be smaller and go
through your firewall.  The information contained in "special appendix b"
is the same as "appendix b" the original sent.  If you have any questions
or problems with the following please call me at 512.345.5415.

Thanks for your patience.

Nicole Brady
