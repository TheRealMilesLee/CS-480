Gerald,

As a follow up to your discussion on Friday with Jill Zivley regarding the Aspect/Helmrich & Payne, et al dedicated lease contract #96055540, Jill asked me to coordinate with you to get the amendment to this contract prepared. Per my discussion with Jill, the following items need to be addressed in the amendment.

Add the new well
Change the working interest
Include a statement to address our timing for changing working interest to the month succeeding the month that we are notified
Extend the contract an additional year from the end of the contract term

I will bring you copies of the contract (including the assignment from Enron North America to ENA Upstream) as well as the working interest sheet as soon as I have them. Jill would like to have this contract completed this week since the well is expected to begin flowing any day.

If you have any questions or need anything else on this request, please let me know.

Thanks,
Judy
