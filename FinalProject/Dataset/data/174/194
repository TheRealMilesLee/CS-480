> Please accept with no obligation,  implied or implicit, our best wishes
>  for an environmentally conscious, socially responsible, low  stress,
>  non-addictive, gender neutral celebration of the winter  solstice
>  holiday, practiced within the most enjoyable traditions of the  religious
>  persuasion of your choice, or secular practices of your choice,  with
>  respect for the religious/secular persuasions and/or traditions  of
>  others, or their choice not to practice religious or secular  traditions
>  at all ...
>  
>  .. And a fiscally successful, personally fulfilling, and  medically
>  uncomplicated recognition of the onset of the generally  accepted
>  calendar year 2002, but not without due respect for the calendars  of
>  choice of other cultures whose contributions to society have helped  make
>  America great, (not to imply that America is necessarily greater  than
>  any other country or is the only "AMERICA" in the Western  Hemisphere),
>  and without regard to the race, creed, color, age, physical  ability,
