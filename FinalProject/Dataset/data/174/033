Steph,

Hey you!  Still trying to get in touch with you, it's no big deal, I know you're probably very busy.  I know when I'm on the road it's pretty hectic.  Or maybe your doing it on purpose to build the suspense.  (Just kidding)  Here's a thought, I will be passing through DIA tomorrow (Friday) on my to San Antonio for the holidays, schedules permitting, would you want to meet for a quick drink at the airport?  I don't know if that's even realistic, just a thought.  Anyway my flight is at 4:30 PM, and depending upon security and other issues, I'll probably have time to kill.  If you get a chance call me at home (303) 469-6768 or on my cell (303) 810-5708.  If you get this message too late have a GREAT holiday and I'll try and talk with you later.

Paul
