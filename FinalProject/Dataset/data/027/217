Based on today's meeting, please complete the following :
Look at the bullet points related to PRTM's definition of a meritocracy and redefine those points to represent Enron's meritocratic culture.
As recommended by Louise, substitute the word "client" to Enron.
Mail to me A.S.A.P.  your distinctive bullets.

I will lump everyone's bullet points together and we can choose from the best.

In addition, I will touch base with Robert Jones to make sure that we are targeting at least a 100 candidates with a variety of backgrounds that we can relate back to each meritocracy bullet point.    

Any questions, please email or call me x31931.

Regards, Mrha
