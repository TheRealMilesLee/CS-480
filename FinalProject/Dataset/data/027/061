Hello All,

	We will begin our soccer season with the first practice 
scheduled for this Wed (Aug 15) at 5:30 pm at the West U microsoccer 
fields (adjacent to West U Elementary School).  This week we will 
have one practice only.  Starting next week (Aug 20) there will be a 
Monday practice with the West U trainers at 5:30 (same fields).  This 
trainer practice is optional - however we found that the kids really 
get a lot out of these trainer practices and they are probably better 
for ball skills than what we will do in coaches practice.  We will 
discuss other issues on Wed.

I'm looking forward to a fun season.

Thanks.

David Rowley

ps.  We are on Field South #5 for the Wed practices.
