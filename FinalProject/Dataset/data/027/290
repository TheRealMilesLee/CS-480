Jeff, you will be missed by many, many people here at Enron.  I know that I and the rest of the internal communications team (Sarah and Courtney) will miss working with you and will miss your engaging management style.  You helped us raise employee communications to a fresh new level, and you'll be a hard act to follow at floor meetings, breakfasts, videos, etc.

I wish you the best in everything you do going forward.  Have fun, take care and God bless.
