All:

Today is my last day at Enron, so I wanted to wish you all well.  I've truly enjoyed working for Enron, and have been given some wonderful opportunities.

Ann, Jacob and I will be moving back to Denver, CO next week and starting the next chapter of our lives, as well as figuring out what the next step in my career will be.

I can be reached on my personal e-mail: a_a_maus@yahoo.com

Take care and best wishes,

Andy
