     Times, June 19, 1988

     I  promise  to do my best, and if at any time my resolution
     lapses,  pen  me a few fierce vitriolic words and you shall
     receive  by  the next post a lachrymose & abject apology in
     my most emotional hand writing.
     --Rupert Brooke, letter to James Strachey, July 7, 1905

     The  game is perpetuated by the sons in a sometimes vicious

     Meanwhile,  a  lachrymose  new  waltz,  "After  The Ball Is
     Over," was sweeping the nation.
     --Benjamin   Welles,   [3]Sumner   Welles:   FDR's   Global
     Strategist
