ATTENTION

Dear;

 I am delighted to write this letter to you hoping that you will understa=
nd
my predicament and answer back without hesitation. I am MRS.MARIAM ABACHA=

wife of the late Nigerian Head of State GENERAL SANI ABACHA. I got your c=
ontact
through business inquires from the chamber or commerce as I was making co=
ntact
for a Honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children, hence
our country has been frustrating to us since the death of my husband. 

I am in possession of $35,000.000 (THIRTY FIVE MILLION U.S DOLLARS) which=

I want to invest in your country. For your clarification and understandin=
g,
this money is in a truck box which was deposited with a security company
indisguise as a family treasure DIAMOND AND GOLD since 5th of May 1999. i=
t
is not an ill gotten wealth rather it was WILLED to me by my late husband=
.
On your acceptance to render this assistance to me, I will instruct the s=
ecurity
company to effect the change of ownership of this fund to your name as th=
e
bona-fide owner/my next of kin to enable you retrieve the fund since the
box can not be moved out of our country by the family's name. Contact me
with by my email(mariamabachaqq@yahoo.co.uk).

It is very important that you forward to me your full name ,your private
telephone and fax numbers/occupation,to enable me send all relevant docum=
ents

ction

ccounts
both local and international bearing the ABACHA'S family name, are been c=
onfiscated
by the Already elected civilian President of Nigeria so called (President=

Olusegun Obasanjo)hence I will not want to be exposed this is to aviod lo=

For your knowledge, 20% of this fund $35,000.000 (THIRTY FIVE MILLION U.S=

DOLLARS) will be given to you if you assist me to secure this fund and an=
other
10% has set aside for all the expenses you might incur during the process=

of securing this fund. Example: TELEPHONE/FAX BILLS and any other miscell=
aneous
expenses. And bear in mind that this is the only remaining fund for the s=
urvival
