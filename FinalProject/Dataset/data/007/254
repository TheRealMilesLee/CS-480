Silence is golden. 







Absence makes the fond heart wander. . All things come to those that wait. . Better to be poor and healthy rather than rich and sick. . A wise man shall hold his tongue till he sees his opportunity. .  
Many hands make light work.   
  
Let the buyer beware.   

Needs must when the devil drives. . Drink like a fish, water only. . Diamonds are forever. . Blood is thicker than water. .  
A little each day is much in a year.   
  
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. . Half a loaf is better than none.  Leave no stone unturned. .
