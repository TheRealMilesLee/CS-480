*. The state budget passed the Assembly last night at approximately 6:55 p.m. PDT.  The MOU hearing, which was supposed to take place following the budget debate, was cancelled due to the late hour.  The Senate is on call to take up the budget (SB 739 [Peace]).  There are rumors that Senator Burton will not accept the large amount of pork put into the budget by the Assembly.  The budget must pass both houses before the legislature can adjourn, so it takes priority over the MOU.

*. The Senate Energy Committee is on call of the chair (Bowen) to discuss the original MOU, sponsored by Polanco.  This is expected to happen sometime today.

*. An Assembly vote on AB 82XX is likely to occur in its floor session on Wednesday or Thursday.  An Assembly floor session is scheduled for Friday on the call of the Speaker.

*. Two Republican votes are now needed to pass any urgency measure or the budget on the Senate side because Senator Kuehl (Dem) has gone on vacation to Italy.  Sen. Perata (Dem) may also go on vacation shortly, meaning that 3 Republican votes would be needed.
