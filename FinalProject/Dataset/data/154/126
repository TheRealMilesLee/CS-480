Forestweb's prices to be listed on Bloomberg Professional Service

LOS ANGELES, Nov 27, 2001 - Forestweb Inc. will be providing  its 
pricing for market pulp, publication grade papers, stumpage, and logs 
to users of the Bloomberg Professional service.

The Los Angeles-based Forestweb has signed an agreement with 
Bloomberg that offers subscribers to the Bloomberg Professional 
service access to both Forestweb Exclusive content and the option to 
subscribe to benchmark pricing from PriceBeat. Forestweb Exclusive 
content includes Forestweb's staff written market reviews. PriceBeat 
is an online subscription-based price and information service.

Pulp prices include prices in the U.S. for northern bleached softwood 
kraft (NBSK), southern bleached softwood kraft (SBSK), northern 
bleached hardwood kraft (NBHK), southern bleached hardwood kraft 
(SBHK), and bleached eucalyptus kraft (BEK). The price in Europe for 
NBSK is also offered.

Forestweb's pulp prices are reported by Diane Keaton. Ms. Keaton has 
been covering market pulp for the past seven years and for the past 
22 months as an editor and reporter with Forestweb. Ms. Keaton has 
been described by a pulp executive as "arguably the most 
knowledgeable market pulp authority in the public domain."

Publication grade prices include newsprint, hi-brite, supercalendered 
(SC-A), 40-lb coated #5, and 60-lb coated #3. Uncoated free-sheet 
grades include 50-lb offset rolls and 20-lb cut size (copy paper).

Reel Time newsletter editors Verle Sutton and Ross Hay-Roe provide 
Forestweb the pricing for publication and communication papers. Reel 
Time is a monthly newsletter offering analysis and forecasts for 
printing paper markets.

Forest2Market provides Forestweb stumpage prices for pine pulpwood, 
pine chip-n-saw, pine sawtimber, hardwood pulpwood, and hardwood 
sawtimber for three southern regions - west south, mid-south, and 
east south. Stumpage refers to the price of timber before it has been 
harvested. Forest2Market is the leading provider of timber pricing 
information for the U.S. South.

Logs are a major export market to the Pacific Rim, with Japan being 
the largest importer of U.S. logs. Forestweb's log prices are 
available through Pacific Rim Wood Market Report, a Forestweb 
publication. It is the only comprehensive timber industry newsletter 
that covers U.S. domestic and export log markets, providing prices, 
trends, and analyses.
