My name is Julie :)  I have this feeling of being negative about pretty much everything.. idea came to me 
to put together pics and videos of me on a website.  It's neet how my private life is inside one website ;) Unlike other sites, it doesn't cost anything to join my site -)
I want to have a cyber friend if you don't mind -)
