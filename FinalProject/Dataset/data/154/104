DEAR SIR, 
 
I AM CONTACTING YOU HAVING CONSIDERED YOU HIGHLY 
REPUTABLE AND CAPABLE OF ASSISTING MY GROUP, IN OUR 
UNDERSTATED PRUDENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL, AFTER GOING 
THROUGH THE IMPRESSIVE PROFILE OF YOUR OUTFIT. 
 
I AM BULUZ AHMED, ESQ., A LEGAL ADVISER TO ONE MRS 
NOYO ABIOLA, ONE OF THE NUMEROUS WIVES OF LATE CHIEF 
M.K.O. ABIOLA, A NIGERIAN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS GURU 
AND TOP POLITICIAN WHO WON A PRESIDENTAIL ELECTION, 
BUT WAS DENIED MANDATE BY MILITARY DICTATORSHIP. 
HE SUBSEQUENTLY DIED IN POLITICAL DETENTION. 
 
PART OF HIS WILL WAS THE DEDICATION OF thirty - FIVE 
MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS, (U$D35,000,000.00=) TO 
THE ONLY CHILD AND SON OF MRS NOYO ABIOLA. 
THIS HAS BROUGHT SERIOUS MISUNDERSTANDINGS AMONG OTHER WIVES AND RELATIONS OF THE LATE POLITICIAN. 
 
THIS AMOUNT WAS SCRECTLY DEPOSITED WITH A TRUST 
COMPANY IN EUROPE BY THE TESTATOR, FOR HIS KID SON, 
WITH RELEVANT DOCUMENTS KEPT WITH THE KIDS MOTHER
MY CHAMBERS AND MRS NOYO ABIOLA HAVE CONCLUDED 
ARRANGEMENTS TO CONTRACT A TRUSTWORTHY AND 
VIABLE FOREIGNER WHO WOULD ASSIST TO 
FACILIATE THE PROCCESSINGS OF THIS 
AMOUNT INTO HIS COMPANY / PRIVATE ACCOUNT. 
 
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT HOWEVER THAT THE 
FOREIGNER WOULD BE REQUIRED TO NEGOTIATE 
AND PURCHASE A VERY COMFORTABLE RESIDENTIAL 
HOME IN HIS COUNTRY UPON RECEIPT OF THE FUND 
WHICH WOULD SERVE AS A SHELTER FOR THE YOUNG 
BOY AND HIS MOTHER TO SETTLE DOWN FOR LIFE 
AS SOON AS THE KID COMPLETES HIS EDUCATION
THE REST OF THE AMOUNT WOULD BE PUT INTO
INVESTMENTS ON BEHALF OF MRS NOYO ABIOLA AND SON. 
YOU WOULD BE ADEQUATELY COMPENSATED FOR THIS GREAT 
ASSISTANCE. 
 
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS FAMILY IS VERY POPULAR AND THUS, WE SHOULD MAINTAIN THE SECRECY OF THIS PROJECT TO AVOID PROTEST FROM OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE COURSE OF PROCESSING THIE FUND INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. 
 
PLEASE LET ME KNOW YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PROPO! SAL ON THE ABOVE EMAIL{buluzahmed@nyc.com} ADDRESS OR DIRECT MOBILE NO:234-330-98427 
SO THAT WE CAN COMMENCE PROCESS OF THE 
TRANSFER. 
 
BEST REGARDS.
