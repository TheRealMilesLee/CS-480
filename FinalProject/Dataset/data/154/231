All:

Due in part to the inability of several members to participate in the call
this afternoon, we are scheduling a second Conference Call for 9 am
tomorrow, Wednesday Nov 28th.

The telephone number will be distributed first thing Wednesday morning.  

We think it best if more of the members participate in the discussion
regarding our Comments on the Joint UDC Proposal.

Please see attachments.  Dan Douglass will also be sending out a revision.
