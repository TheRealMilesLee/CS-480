....just crazy, I've been dying to call you all day to make sure you were
okay but I figured your probably being bombarded with calls right now, so I
was just waiting for some time.  There are a lot of rumors out there? Are
you okay? The latest piece of news is your possible chapter 7 filing, and
I've been raking my mind trying to see if you guys will be taken care of in
that case. I know you all have personal contracts.  Its amazing how a great
company like Enron can come tumbling down to its knees.  I can't even
imagine the atmosphere over there, I was watching the screen as you guys
pulled all of your numbers, I really couldn't speak for a second.  This
industry is never boring that's for sure.  I've been getting calls from
everyone, it looks like the key word for the day is exposure....
