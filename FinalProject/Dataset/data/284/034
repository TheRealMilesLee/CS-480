MR. MING YANG
HANG SENG BANK LTD.
83, Des Voeux Road.,
Central HK,
Hong Kong.
mingyang_h@yahoo.com.hk

Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Ming Yang
director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have an
obscured business suggestion for you.

Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan
 who was with the Iraqi forces and also businessman made a
numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value
of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State
Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several
notices was sent to him, even during the war which began in
2003. Again after the war another notification was sent
and still no response came from him. We later find out that
the General along with his wife and only daughter had been killed
during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home.
You can read more about the bombings on visiting these
sites below:

After further investigation it was also discovered that
Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan  did not declare any next of kin in his
official papers including the paper work of his bank
deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at
my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my
bank. So, Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United
State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will
ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that
according to the laws of my country at the
expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership
of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the
funds.
Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will
like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to
Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan  so that you will be able to receive his
funds.

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out
so that we shall come out successful. I have an
attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will
back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan, all
that is required from you at this stage is for you to
provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the
attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the
next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on
your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of
probate in your favour for the move of the funds to an
account that will be provided by you.

There is no risk involved at all in this matter, as we are
going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will
prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to
observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this
issue.
Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank
account we shall then share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for
you. Should you be interested please send me your full
names, private phone/fax and current residential address
and I will prefer you reach me on my private email address below:
mingyang_h@yahoo.com.hk
and finally after that I shall provide
you with more details of this operation.

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards
Mr. Ming Yang
