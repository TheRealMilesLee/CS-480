OATI webCARES Security Officer,

For those Security Officers whose Companies do not use or access the JTSIN
OASIS Systems, please disregard this e-mail.

As of today, the majority of JTSIN OASIS Administrators across North America
have decided to accept OATI digital certificates.  The following is a
summary of JTSIN Nodes and their decisions regarding OATI digital
certificates:

JTSIN OASIS Node	Accepting OATI Certificates?	
ECAR OASIS	No	
EES OASIS	Still deciding	
MAIN OASIS	Testing w/ OATI Certs, decide soon	
MAPP OASIS	Yes	
MISO OASIS	Yes	
NEPOOL OASIS	Yes	
New Brunswick OASIS (not JTSIN, but requires certs)	Yes	
Northwest OASIS	No	
Rocky Mountain OASIS	Yes	
SWPP OASIS	Yes	
VACAR OASIS	Yes	

Many OATI digital certificate users have contacted OATI regarding the
process for registering their OATI digital certificate in JTSIN Nodes that
will accept OATI certificates.  At this time, I have been told the following
by some entities familiar with the new JTSIN software: There will be a user
interface in the JTSIN software that will allow the Security Officer from a
Company to access the JTSIN system for the purpose of linking the new
digital certificates to the Company's Users in the JTSIN System.  Therefore,
the JTSIN Node Administrators will need to know who the Security Officer or
Officers are from each Company.  Please contact the appropriate JTSIN Node
Administrator(s) to find out more about this process (and verify that this
is the actual process) and when this interface will be available at each
JTSIN Node.

An efficient method for informing JTSIN Node Administrators who your
Company's Security Officers are is to make your Company's public certificate
data available through the OATI LDAP or CSV file dump interfaces (please see
the attachment more information about this feature).  Due to questions and
concerns raised by many of our Security Officers about this process, neither
the LDAP interface or the CSV file dump are accessible to the public.
Access to this data will only be made available to known third-parties in
the industry that have a need to access this data, such as JTSIN OASIS Node
Administrators.

For those Companies that access the NEPOOL JTSIN OASIS Nodes, please choose
to make your Company's certificate data available through the CSV file dump
and LDAP interface as the Node Administrator would like to begin testing the
CSV file dump for identifying Company Security Officers (certificate type
has now been added to this file dump).  For those Companies that do not want
to make this data available, then please communicate to the Node
Administrator who your OATI certificate Security Officer is through other
means.

Finally, OATI will continue to talk with the remaining JTSIN nodes that are
still deciding which certificates to accept as well as those who have
initially said they will not accept OATI certificates.  OATI also urges all
Companies that access those JTSIN Nodes and want to use their OATI
certificates to contact the OASIS Administrators and provide your input on
this subject. 

If anyone has any questions or would like more information about the
subjects covered in this e-mail, please feel free to contact me. 

Thank you,
