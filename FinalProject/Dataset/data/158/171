Joe, I really appreciate your offer to forward my resume to your father at FPL.  I forwarded my resume to Irma Sulaiman @ FPL yesterday in response to a job posting in yesterday's Houston Chronicle.

The position, "Energy Trader", calls for at least 1-3 years of experience in fuels, energy marketing or energy trading; all of which I have experience in.

Below is the cover letter and resume that I e-mailed yesterday.  Again, I truly appreciate you helping me out!

<<<<Cover Letter>>>>

I would like to express my interest in the "Energy Trader" position posted in the Houston Chronicle, Sunday, December 2, 2001.

I have been trading power at Enron for the U.S. Eastern Interconnect and am very familiar with all facets of executing hourly and daily trades, including the utilization of trading tools and indices for all energy commodities.

I have over nine years of related experience and have also received my MBA during my four-year tenure at Enron.  My experience ranges from petroleum terminal management, refining and wholesale marketing, fuel management, pipeline and vessel/barge scheduling; liquefied natural gas (LNG); and trading power for the U.S. Eastern Interconnect power grid.

My attached resume illustrates an intense level of vertically integrated experience and knowledge of the energy business.  I believe that my vast experience and advanced education could be of great benefit to your company.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss career options with someone at your company.

Sincerely,

Dustin Collins
