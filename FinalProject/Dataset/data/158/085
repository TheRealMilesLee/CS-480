We will NOT be deactivating counterparties at this point.  This issue may be revisited but for now leave things as they are.

This is very unclear - does Savita understand it.  This has to be live tomorrow morning - who implemented it?

savita:
Mark left me a voice mail that Louise wished to turn off those counterparties that have terminated their contracts with us.  Enclosed is an excel spreadsheet that lists those counterparties that we have received termination notices from (click on the "terminations" category).  Please call Tana and/or I to discuss.
