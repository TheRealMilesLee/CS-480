Dear Mr Lay,
 
I don't know if this will get to you personally or if someone filters your email, but I sincerely hope you get a chance to read this.
 
I haven't been with Enron very long.  I was hired in August and left my old job in Austin because I wanted the experience of working for a great company.  I want you to know that I do not regret my decision to come here.  I have never worked for a company that treats people with such dignity.  It amazes me that throughout all of this, I knew that you would do everything you could to make sure that the employees are okay.  I can't say that I would have felt that way at any other job I have had.  I know now that good companies are out there, and have no doubt that I will have a chance to experience that again.
 
The past few months must have been a nightmare for you.  I cannot imagine what it feels like to build a company to greatness and watch it disintegrate because of the greed of a few.  I'm sure that no words can console you, but I want you to know that most of the employees I have talked to do not blame you.  
 
Whatever happens next week, I want you to know that you are in my prayers.
 
Debbie Riall
