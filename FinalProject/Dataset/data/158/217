How will my relocation costs be handled if I moved recently and I have not yet been reimbursed for all costs incurred?

A.	  You should submit your Relocation Expense Report to Prudential Relocation as soon as possible.  Prudential is now requiring payment from Enron in advance before reimbursement is made to an employee.  Enron has made a deposit towards estimated international relocation costs, but all moves in process may not have been captured which may cause delays in processing.

Questions regarding the status of your Relocation Expense reimbursement should be directed to Deborah Kallus of Prudential Relocation in Houston at 713 853 1426 or deborah.kallus@enron.com.
