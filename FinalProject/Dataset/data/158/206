Eric,

You are out of balance for the 30th.  I assumed this was another cut deal, but I don't know who to enter a deal with you in EnPower.  This has resulted in approx. -$5k to your P&L today.  If you could fix this upon your return, the money will come back in your P&L at the end of Dec.

Thanks,
Tim
