Spoke with Perry Frazier in facility planning.  There are no screen prints of TW's web site for the last week of January or the first week of February.  These can be recreated, but they take approximately 20 hours for each day.

Good news!  We were able to find copies of all the other competing bids and service request forms.  I will fax these to you.
