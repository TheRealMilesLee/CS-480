Dear Sir/Madam
 
I am pleased to get across to you for a very urgent and profitable 
business proposal, though I don't know you neither have I seen you 
before but my confidence was reposed on you when the Chief Executive of
Lagos State chamber of Commerce and Industry handed me your contact for 
a confidential business. I am the manager of United Bank for Africa Plc 
(UBA), Ilupeju branch, Lagos Nigeria. The intended business is thus; We 
had a customer, a Foreign resident in Nigeria, he was a Contractor with 
one of the Government Parastatals. He has in his Account in my branch
the sum ofUS 15.5 Million (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U.S 
{Dollars).Unfortunately, the man died three years ago until today non-
of his next of kin has come forward to claim the money. Having noticed 
this, I in collaboration with two other top Officials of the bank have 
covered up the account all this while. Now we want you (being a
foreigner) to be fronted as one of his next of kin and forward your 
account and other relevant documents to be advised to you by us to 
attest to the Claim. We will use our positions to get all internal 
documentations to back up the claims. The whole procedures will last 
only five working days to get the fund retrieved successfully without 
trace even now or in future. Your response is only what we are waiting
for as we have arranged all necessary things.
 
As soon as this message comes to you kindly get back to me indicating 
your interest, then I will furnish you with the whole procedures to 
ensure that the deal is successfully concluded. For your assistance we
have agreed to give you twenty five percent (25%) of the Total sum at 
the end of the transaction while 65% would be for my colleagues and I 
and the remaining 10% would be for any form of expenses that may be
incurred during the course of the transaction which would be given to 
us when the money is transferred into your account before splitting the 
balance on the agreed percentage of 65% to 25%. In order to get all the 
legal documents from the court, kindly send the following information 
to us immediately. Your full name, telephone, mobile and fax numbers as 
well as your resident or company address. I await your earliest
response.Please reply through my personal email: f_okolo@jumpy.it or
