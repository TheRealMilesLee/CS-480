Mucho Congratulations!

We need to make your "graduation" official with a happy hour sometime before Christmas.  {I know...we're always looking for an excuse to party.}

Great job.

Dan

I'm done!!  I'm all done!!  Remember when I left you guys a message after
having my eyes done?  Well this is the same feeling.  It's just so great, I
had to share it with all of you.  It's a tremendous feeling.  I can't stop
smiling.  Thanks for all your help on my many little projects for school.

Talk to you guys later.  Take care,

Jess
