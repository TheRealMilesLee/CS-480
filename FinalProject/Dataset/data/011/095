Attached is the proposed long and short descriptions for the day ahead and real-time PJM products.  Please note that the long description for the real-time products has been updated to reflect the new format/wording on their website to include "Daily Real-Time".  The current short description is:

US Pwr Fin Swap  PJM W IntC Peak

To better clarify, "RT" and "DA" could be added to distinguish between the two pricing locations on their website.  Even if the current real-time PJM products are not being traded, we could make this change in case they are offered in the future.  Let me know what you all think.
