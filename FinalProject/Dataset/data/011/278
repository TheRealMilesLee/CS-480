MY DEAR FRIEND

RE:THE TRANSFER OF FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS INTO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT.

VIRTUE OF ITS NATURE AS BEING UTTERLY CONFIDENTIAL AND TOP SECRET. I AM
ASSURING YOU THAT ALL WILL BE WELL AT THE END OF THE DAY. I HAVE
DECIDED TO CONTACT YOU BY EMAIL DUE TO THE URGENCY OF THIS TRANSACTION.

(MRS) MARY  DIKE, THE PRESIDENT OF SUPREME CHAMBERS LAGOS NIGERIA. I CAME
TO KNOW OF YOU IN MY PRIVATE SEARCH FOR A RELIABLE AND REPUTABLE PERSON TO
HANDLE THIS CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS, WHICH INVOLVES THE TRANSFER OF A HUGE
SUM OF MONEY TO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT. I AM SORRY FOR CONTACTING YOU IN THIS
MANNER AND THROUGH THIS MEDIUM; IT WAS A MATTER OF URGENCY:

EXPECTS IT TO BE CLAIMED BY ANY AVAIABLE FOREIGN NEXT-OF-KIN OF THE LATE
BENEFICIARY . ALL THE EFFORTS BEING MADE BY ME TO GET IN TOUCH WITH ANY OF
LOMBARD FAMILY OR RELATIVES HAS NOT BEING SUCCESSFUL AS HE HAD KNOW WIFE
AND CHILDREN. HERE, IT IS ECAUSE OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY TO LOCATE ANY OF HIS
FOREIGN NEXT-OF-KIN THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF THE BANK HAS MADE AN
ARRANGEMENT FOR THE FUNDS TO BE DECLARED UNCLAIMABLE AND SUBSEQUENTLY BE
DONATED FOR THE PURCHASE OF ARMS AND AMMUNITION TO FURTHER ENHANCE THE WAR

IN ORDER TO AVOID THIS NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENT, I NOW SEEK YOUR PERMISSION TO
HAVE YOU STAND AS THE NEXT-OF-KIN TO THE LATE DR. PETER LOMBARD WHO IS MY
CLIENT SO THAT THIS $15M WOULD BE TRANSFERRED AND PAID INTO YOUR BANK
ACCOUNT AS THE FOREIGN BENEFICIARY NEXT-OF-KIN. ALL PROVES TO ENABLE YOU
GET THIS FUND WILL BE CAREFULLY WORKED OUT AND I AM ASSURING YOU OF A 100%
RISK FREE INVOLVEMENT BECAUSE I AM THE LAWYER TO THIS LATE DR.PETER
LOMBARD.

THIS FUND WILL BE SHARED AFTER IT HAS BEING TRANSFERRED INTO YOUR
ACCOUNT IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS.
{1} 35% OF THIS FUNDS WILL BE FOR YOU FOR ACTING AS THE BENEFICIARY OF
THIS FUNDS.
{2} 5% WILL BE SET ASIDE TO REFUND TO BOTH PARTIES OF ANY EXPENSES INCURED
IN THE COURSE OF THE TRANSFER OF THIS FUND INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.
{3} 60% WILL BE FOR ME WHICH WILL BE USE FOR INVESTMENT IN YOUR

ADVANTAGE OF THE TRUST, KINDLY GET BACK TO  ME IMMEDAITELY PLEASE.
