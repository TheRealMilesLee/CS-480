NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCa||/ -- Millennium 
Nationa| Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has 
entered 
into negotiations to acquire a|| or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Mil|ennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.

 
Mi||ennium earlier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering 
into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both local De|ray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two 
entities. "Basical|y we're both from the same industry, and together I 
be|ieve 
we could be bigger and accomp|ish more than as stand-a|one companies," 
said Robert McA|lister, CEO & President of Mil|ennium National Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Mil|ennium's offers and believe that there could be 
a possible f i t here for our company and our share ho|ders."

McAl|ister also feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Mi|lennium shareho|ders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overa|l business plan. It has always been our 
intent to 
target and acquire successful, high-profile events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for almost one year now. Conso|idation 
is the key, not on|y to our bottom line, but also to the success of 
each individua| event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mil|ennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition u|timately being able to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom line.

MNEI sees both the international te|evision audience and the abi|ity to 
attract a Fortune 50O as a potential source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McA||ister expects the dea| to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the Delray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Mi||ennium ITC inc|udes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, current|y No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michae| Gambi|l and James Blake. A|so entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), currently at No. 25, 
two-time 
Mil|ennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Malisse (Be|gium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Mello (Brazil). The tournament sti|| holds two wildcards that 
can 
be offered to other top p|ayers in the weeks leading up to the event.
