<p><b>With Tragedy May Also Come Opportunity...</b></p></font>
</div>

</p>

The tragedy of December 26 ,2004 left behind a sea of wreckage.  Over 150,000 people were killed, and health officials believe many more people will die from health concerns related to poor living conditions.
<br><br>
One company will help people who need assistance, and in the process, forecasts future profits of <b>$500 million in the next several years.</b>  Breaking news, find this at:
<a href="http://www.pinksheets.com/quote/news.jsp?url=fis_story.asp%3Ftextpath%3DCOMTEX%5Cbw%5C2005%5C01%5C31%5C20827431.html%26clientid%3D168%26provider%3DBUSINESS_WIRE&symbol=FCAH" target="new.window"><font color="blue"><u>BREAKING NEWS.</u></font></a>
</a> 
<br><br>
We all learned of the devastation from the giant earthquake turned Tsunami the day after the grandest holiday of them all...and this tragedy has, in turn, illuminated the need for government and aid agencies to assist in providing good, low-cost living facilities not only for those people in harms way on December 26, but for many people in third-world and lesser-developed countries around the globe.
<br><br>
Now, government and aid agencies are clamoring for ways to bring living standards up for many people who are less fortunate...and one company looking to assist these efforts may have found the remedy for a low-cost, efficient solution to this real-world problem.
<br>
<p>

First Canadian American Holdings <b>
<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=fcah.pk" target="new.window"><font color="blue"><u>(ticker: FCAH.PK) </u></font></a></b> and Terra Block, Inc. have formed a joint-venture.  The purpose behind their endeavor
will be to provide a low-cost
<a href="http://www.fcahc.com/system.html" target="new.window"><font color="blue"><u>building alternative </u></font></a> for residential and commercial facilities to be developed in third-world and lesser-developed countries. Their ability to provide housing and hazardous waste storage facilities at a fraction of the cost of conventional builders may pave the way to secure both foreign aid and foreign government contracts. 
<br><br>
<div align="center">
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1" color="#000000">
<p><b>The Building Process...</b></p></font>
</div>
<br>
In addition to being very low-cost, their patented <a href="http://www.fcahc.com/wtb.html" target="new.window"><font color="blue"><u>block-building process </u></font></a> creates blocks from soil where the structure will be built(yes, you read that correctly).  The soil is then mixed into a small machine, and the machine kicks out approximately 250 blocks per hour.  Labor costs are typically low, however, the building and finishing of the facility provides job opportunities for the local community.
<br><br>
Striving to create value, building methods have surpassed the most stringent standards in the  U.S - namely, Florida's requirements for building in a coastal hurricane zone (155 MPH standard).  While no structure is completely fail-safe, FCAH and Terra Block look to combine low cost/high-safety facilities with the simplicity of creating the structure directly from the surrounding area.
<br><br>

<p><b>Project Guatamala</b></p></font>
</div>
<br>
There are many countries in need of simple, efficient methods of providing low-cost housing for its citizens.  First Canadian and Terra Block have undertaken their first project in Guatamala, where there is a huge discrepancy between the rich and poor.  Considered the most wealthy of the Central American nations, Guatamala's topography of rich soil offers a potential blockbuster opportuntiy for FCAH and Terra Block.  
<br><br>
With relations already underway between FCAH/Terra and Guatamalan Congressman Antonio Ochoa, inroads are being built to consumate a large, dynamic project in this region.  In addition, 75 additional <a href="http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/third_world_countries.htm" target="new.window"><font color="blue"><u>third-world and lesser developed countries</u></font></a> can be targeted by FCAH/Terra's innovative patented process.
<br><br>
From such a tragedy, we find the ability to reach out and help others in time of need.  It also allows for the illumination of huge potential markets in certain business sectors.  FCAH and Terra Block look to provide people with a simple, special, low-cost alternative to conventional builders, while capitalizing on this highly-needed process.  They and their shareholders alike may reap fortunes at one end, while creating value and helping others on the other end.
