I talked to Rick's parents tonight about the  cause of Rick's death.  It was not anaphylactic shock.  According to  the autopsy report he died from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an enlarged  heart.  There is no word whether this is a condition he was born with or  something that developed later in life.  Rick never complained of any of  the symptoms listed and often sudden death is the first indication of the  disease.  I have attached a bit of material I found.  Please see that  this reaches as many people as possible.  I just don't want to  be  responsible for spreading the word right now.  Thanks.  If anyone has  any further information, please have them forward it to me if they  would.
 
Andrea
