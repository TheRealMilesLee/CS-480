I called Earl Chanley regarding the "B" release and he mentioned that go ahead and use this as a "B" release because it is close enough.
If you have any questions please call.

The level "A" cost for the Agave I/C on the TW West Texas Lateral are as follows.

The I/C is a 10" UltraSonic designed for a range of 35 mmcfd to +100 mmcfd. 
By using the US meter, this allows a wide range of volumes without changing out the tube when Agave want to increase the volumes.

EFM
DAS
UPS

Material cost = $210,000

Install cost (contractor, inspection, Dlab, Eng, Proj. man) = $130,000

Contingency = $ 50,000

OH, AFUDC, = $ 19,000

Total of I/C = $399,000

This is a Level "A" cost and to target the equipment needed and bring the cost into a Level "B" will required a defined scope with Agave. THE TIME REQUIRED FOR A PROJECT TO BE IN SERVICE IS 90 DAYS FROM THE APPROVED WORK ORDER.
