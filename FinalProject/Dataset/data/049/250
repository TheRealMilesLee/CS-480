I don't get them anymore, but I don't think alumni can participate in
on-campus recruiting.

Subject: CSO-Finance Presentation & Resume Drop Update


Despite the postponement of company presentations this week by PWC-FAS,
Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo, all three companies as of today still
plan
to conduct their on-campus interviews as scheduled.  Thus, to ensure
that
they receive your resumes with time to prepare their interview lists,
the
resume drop deadline for these companies, as well as Citigroup, will
remain
Friday, September 14th, at 11:59 p.m.

We are currently working with the companies to reschedule their
presentations as soon as possible.  Please don't hesitate to contact me
if
you have any questions or concerns.
