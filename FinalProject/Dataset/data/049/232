FW: for Board review and commentThe LA Times is already on this story without the letter. Marcus has briefed them, and it's a go.
I will be quoted along the lines of the letter, but at this point, I'm in no hurry.

I appreciate your support with Hap, though, very much.

I don't mind taking risks, but I don't want to precipitate a palace coup led by Calpine.  

Working on a Friday, Sept 21st event in San Diego targeting Sempra. Have found some new allies among the Latinos.

Stay tuned.

  FYI.  Unless I hear from you, I'm telling Hap that it's fine. 

  Best,

  Jeff, 
  John White has proposed to the CEERT Board that we send the attached letter to the Governor attacking the DWR contracts. Would you please take a look at it and let me know what you think of it.  You can reach me on my cell phone at 213-359-0853. Thanks.

  Hap
