Todd -

So sorry to dump this on you last minute.  They have just sent me another
requirement for the RPS data dump.  We will also need the pass through costs
as a field for each record in the data dump.

Please let me know if this is going to be a problem.  We are still wanting
to get the data dump today, even if you cannot satisfy this last request.
We can get the final field later.

Thanks.

Another field for pass through costs will need to be added to the
database.  Also when you get the meeting set with the power deal
management person to discuss data input into RPS Kristin and I would
like to participate.  I should be around all day if you need anything.
