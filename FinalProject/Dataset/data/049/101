Louise,

I left you a tasking letter for approval last week for your signature.  Have you had a chance to sign it or do you have any questions? We are now out of approved funding for EOS activities without approval of this tasking letter.  

In the past, Brian Redmond was the approver for ENA, but he referred these to you going forward.  If this is not correct, please let me know.

Thanks!

Mike
