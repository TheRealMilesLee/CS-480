__________________________________________________________________

Topic:          The Window Cracks Open: IPOs in the 2001 Market
Speakers:       James Socas, Managing Director, Credit Suisse First Boston; 
Stephen R. Wong, CEO, President & Co-Founder, Embarcadero Technologies, Raj 
P. Sabhlok, Sr VP, Finance & Development, Embarcadero Technologies.

What is the health of the public markets today?  Is it possible for young 
companies to go public in this environment?  It is no secret that we are in 
the midst of a severe contraction in start-up funding.  Venture capitalists 
are reserving cash to support their existing portfolio and to invest in 
later round financings.  When will this situation free up?  Will a revived 
public market make start-up financing more available?

Our September 20th U.C. Berkeley Entrepreneurs Forum will feature an expert 
in the current IPO market and the CEO and VP of Finance of a firm that has 
recently completed the IPO process.

Registration: There are special rates for faculty and staff. Faculty and 
staff are encouraged to pre-register by E-mail.

a) in person with cash or check in room F450 or F449, weekdays 8AM to 5PM.
b) with Mc/Visa over the phone, please call (510) 642 4255

The fee for pre- registration is $5. There will be a $10 registration fee 
at the door. Note: On-site registration is subject to space available. Pre- 
registration for students and staff closes at 4PM on Tuesday, September 18,
