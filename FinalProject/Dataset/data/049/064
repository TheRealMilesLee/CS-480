·	Aviation experts are speculating that the system of getting the country's air transportation system fully restarted may take a week to finish.  Officials cautioned it could be several days before flights are allowed to resume as normal in order to institute tougher security measures.

o	Some of the airstrips that accepted jetliners may not have the refueling capacity to relaunch the planes.
o	Some of the crew members that are stranded with their planes may not be able to finish their flights under federal rules outlining the number of hours they can work in a 24-hour period (of course, this will be a moot point in a few more hours).
o	However, some airlines, including Southwest and America West, have announced plans to resume flights at noon today.
