Jeanne,
In talking with Mark McConnell, Jerry Graves and Darrell Schoolcraft we think that if you can have David Duff pull the following point operational capacity out of TCI we can determine what Mark needs.  Please go back as far as you can in the database.  Some points may not exist because they were not in place back in 93 or 94, but pull as much history as you can. 
	Name			POI           
	SoCal - Topock		0056697
	SoCal - Needles		0010487
	PG&E - Topock		0056698
	S.W. Willow Valley	0013198
	N. Starsteel		0500383
	Mojave - Topock		0056696
	Citizen - Kingman	0056659
	Citizen - 89 North	0500046
	Citizen - Forest Branch	0500619
	Citizens - Flagstaff	0500134


Darrell, Jerry and I would like to validate the information prior to forwarding to Mark, so please send me the file and I will coordinate the review.  It might be helpful to know the field names in TCI if you can't find operational capacity.  We probably called it something different back then.

Thank you for your help.
Donna
