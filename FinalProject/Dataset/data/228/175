As we work through all the assumptions on the 10 year Plan info for Stan, it would be helpful if I (or a member of my staff) could be involved in the specific discussions as to what the assumptions are that are being considered. Although we have been involved in some of those meetings it appears that significant changes have been made at the last minute without ever being discussed with the Commercial Group. If I am to be responsible for answering questions as to the details then I would like to provide input prior to any future meetings with Stan on these issues. 

There are several areas that I would like to sit down with you to discuss:

-First, I would like to see the forward curves used to price capacity from '06 going forward;

-Once we have the forward curves from now to '06, I would like to see those also (if we thought those prices didn't look good then how do we justify assuming resubscription at Max rates going forward?) Is Max for both East and West capacity at the same time a good assumption? The market has never allowed that kind of deal structure; 

-What expansion scenarios are we assuming? I understand that they were changed sometime today yet I was not told what is in the current plan;

I would like to be able to put together the most beneficial and realistic plan for TW going forward as we all have the same interests in mind. Thanks.

Steve
