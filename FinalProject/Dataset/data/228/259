             Time To Use Your Draft 
   **********************************

Presidents' Day weekend is a great time to buy a car

The approaching holiday is the perfect time to use your E-LOAN check draft to buy a car. 
Save money by combining President's day dealer sales with E-LOAN's low loan rates.

Use the following tips to ensure that you get the best deal possible:

1.  Do your research - Research your car's invoice price and MSRP before you visit the dealer.

">

2.  Talk to the Internet Sales Manager - Dealing directly with the ISM can often help you negotiate 
the best price for your car. 

3.  Determine your monthly payment - You can affect your monthly payment by adjusting the term 
of your loan. Use E-LOAN's auto payment calculator to design a payment structure that works for you.

">

4.  Maximize your trade-in - Sell your existing car yourself to maximize its value. If you do trade it in, 
clean and repair your car to enhance its appeal. 

5.  Determine your down payment - Down payment is a matter of preference. However, thanks to your low E-LOAN rate your cash may be better used elsewhere. Use Manufacturer Rebates and 
Cash Back Incentives to reduce the amount you have to finance. 

Remember, using your E-LOAN check draft is easy. Once you've negotiated the price for your car, simply fill out and sign the draft and provide the required documentation to the Internet Sales Manager.

Then drive away in your new car!
