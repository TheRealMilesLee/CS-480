Today we filed with FERC 5 paper direct testimonies and numerous exhibits that constitute Enron's affirmative case against the Pacific Northwest refund claims.  The filing, in Gary's and my view, is quite strong and is part of and supported by the larger sellers' group - the Transaction Finality Group.  In addition, we filed under seal Enron's ripple case offer of proof.  This was made possible by a motion that we won this morning that allowed us to proceed with aggregate claims in a quasi-public forum, but, at the same time, file our individual ripple claims only with the judge, protected from all public disclosure.  Please call me if you have any questions.
