Laura,

The first job description is the one Jan Moore applied for (Stephen Gilbert's position)...the 2nd one is a Sr Fin Plng Spec opened by Barney...and the 3rd is the most recent one posted by Elaine.

Let me know if you need me to do more researching.  All the ones I viewed looked extremely similar.


Thanks!

   

Kristin
