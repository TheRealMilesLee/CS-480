Barry, thanks for the number.  Also, I just thought of something.  The 1:30
I referred to is 1:30pm Calgary time,,,, is that all right with you?  I
don't think you need to bring any homework.  We've got your 2000 file and
that should be sufficient.

Hi, I'm back.

Please fax the IRS notice to me at the number below if you haven't
already
and I'll review it for you.

Regarding the counselling session, I am available tomorrow all day,
Wednesday afternoon after 1:30pm, Thursday afternoon after 2pm and
Friday
after 2pm.  Next week I'll be out of the office Tuesday and Wednesday as
well as Thursday afternoon.  The next week I am out of the office on a
course all week (Sept 8-14).

Will any of these time slots work for you?

Send me a note when you get back and we can set up a meeting then.

Also, I received a notice from the IRS and it appears that they were
missing information on my wife and as such disallowed me claiming her as
a dependent.  I will send to your attention to review and clarify. Based
on my filing and actual refund there is about a $ 1k difference which I
believe is owed to me.

Good morning Barry,

Just to let you know that I am on holidays August 11-26, so your
counselling will have to be this week or when I return.

Did Enron provide you with approval for a "Post Arrival
Consultation"/PAC?
This is the counselling our PwC Houston office does.  (So, in effect
there
are two possible counselling sessions for assignees - the predeparture
counselling you are supposed to receive before you depart Canada and
then
there's the PAC).  PwC Houston is prepared to set up the "PAC" - they
simply want to know if you received approval for it.

Thanks,
