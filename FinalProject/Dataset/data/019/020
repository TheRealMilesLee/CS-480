Thanks for the info.  As we discussed today, I'd like to catch up on Monday and determine the best way to "divide and conquer."  Not sure when you will be in and available.  I know I'm booked solid on Monday, but call me on my cell and I'll make time to discuss.
 
Thanks.

Brenda,  

In talking with Chris he was able to round up these newly signed deal customers as having the 90/110 band terms included in their contracts. (See customers in email from Chris)

In addition when checking with others in the EES organization regarding the old contracts he was told that most of the older contracts which have been in place from 1997 to current have the band terms included in them as well.  

I would think that our best bet is to get together with project Phoenix resources and see if we can get examples of contracts which are handled by each of the settlement resources we have. (CSC, Avista, Enron…)

Let me know if you wish for me to drive this forward or if you have it covered.  

FYI…I will be in Houston next week. 8/6 - 8/10.

Thanks - MO
