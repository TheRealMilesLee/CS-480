News Release:
DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan. 14 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/
Millennium National Events: MNEI today announced that
it has entered into an exclusive agreement with
SIGN-A-RAMA, giving the sign giant's 700 stores
in 35 countries the benefit of Millennium's preferred
vendor status with IMG, SFX and Clear Channel, and
its access to over 5000 events worldwide.

Millennium's strength exists in its ability to produce
one of the most robust and diverse schedules of events
using all venues for concerts, sporting events, festivals
and trade shows," said Mitchell Steinberg, Chairman
and COO of Millennium.

"Consolidating our signage consumption under one umbrella
with a company that has the scope and vision of
SIGN-A-RAMA will mean tremendous economy of scale
purchasing power to us and will yield significant
additional margin for both of our companies," added
Steinberg.

Industry estimates suggest that the expense budget on
signage for events in 2004 ran to approximately one
billion dollars worldwide.

The alliance with SIGN-A-RAMA will bring value-added
benefits to Millennium, with SIGN-A-RAMA shops throughout
the world acting as "printing and graphics divisions"
of the company. Added Steinberg, "It allows us to
outsource, which is key to streamlining operations,
the added bonus being that we maintain control and
confidence in execution. We know SIGN-A-RAMA shops
have the ability to get the job done, just about
anywhere in the world. Instead of being one more thing
to worry about, it becomes one more solid building
block in Millennium's ability to be a turnkey event
promoter worldwide."

Ray Titus, President of both SIGN-A-RAMA and EMBROIDME,
added, "We see this affiliation with Millennium as a
natural extension for both of our franchise companies,
SIGN-A-RAMA and EMBROIDME. The signage and embroidery
business is a perfect complement to any, and all,
events, and we are extremely excited about the positive
impact this will have for our family of franchise owners.
