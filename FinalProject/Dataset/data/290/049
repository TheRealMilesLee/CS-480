We are Diplomats that use our immunity and status to safekeep special
and valuable packages and baggage in trust for reputable clients that
are honest and trustworthy.

We work in collaboration with top firms and Governments of various
countries as we have earned a name as a service whose hallmarks in
reliability and confidentiality are revered.
International missions, Fellow Diplomats and Embassies of the world
have used our services to satisfaction.

A benefactor has mandated me to get someone that can assist her and
her family in retrieving her package containing some amount of money
from a Diplomatic Corps in Europe.

The benefactor and her children have been confined only to their
country home and all their calls and movements are monitored, as a
result,its absoultely impossible for them to do anything as regards
retrieving the money. 

Their only means of communication is via internet and you are being
contacted because your assistance is needed in claiming the funds on
their behalf. 

In order to clear any misgivings or doubts that you may have, it is
imperative that I give you an insight of who the benefactor is.

I do not know how conversant you are with events and the fragile
political situation in Liberia but it has made consistent headlines
on CNN, BBC and several news bulletins around the world. 

The benefactor is Mrs.Suzana Isaac Nuhan Vaye, wife of the late
Deputy Minister of Works in Liberia (Isaac Nuhan Vaye) who was
murdered by Taylor during the regime of President Charles Taylor on
the false accusation and trumped up charges of trying to overthrow
Charles Taylor. 

The late Isaac Nuhan Vaye raised a substantial amount of money from
Diamond Sales over a period of six years and these funds were
carefully moved out and deposited with Diplomats in Europe for
safekeeping before his assasination by Charles Taylor. 

The amount accrued from the Diamond sales over this period of six
years is USD75M (Seventy Five Million U.S.Dollars) and these funds
are fully free of any liens, or encumbrances and are clean, clear and
has no criminal origin. 

The funds have nothing to do with any form of illegality and all
documentations needed to prove the source of the funds were submitted
when the funds were being deposited and these documents would prove
the source of the funds and authenticate the fact that the funds are
clean and has no links whatsoever with either drugs or terrorism. 

For your assistance in this transaction,the benefactor and her
Children have agreed to give you 25% of the total amount of money
which is equivalent to US$18.75 Million (Eighteen Million,Seven
Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars) for your role in
this transaction which involves retrieving the funds on their behalf
from the Diplomats in Europe and all the information needed to claim
the funds would be sent to you as soon as you indicate your interest
in assisting them as well as providing the following information to
facilitate the smooth conclusion of the transaction.

Requested Information are as follows;

Your Full Name: ______________________________

Your Complete Address (Physical Address With Zip Code) :
