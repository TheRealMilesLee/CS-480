This is a portion of the capacity release revenues for February and March that have exceeded Trailblazer's post petition administrative claim.  The lawyers are trying to get more money released back to ENA.  Rita, this payment should be booked as incremental transportation revenues rather than a financial settlement payment.  Trailblazer should be considered the payer rather than Kinder Morgan.  Also, if we can ever find the letter/invoices that TBPL sent us, I am sure that TBPL will be paying us monthly for April through September 2002 business.

Good morning Ruth!

Cynthia Shoup in Financial Settlements is inquiring about booking instructions for a $34,978.01 payment received from Kinder Morgan.  Ed Chamness @ KM told Cynthia he sent Ed McMichael a letter which contains detail supporting the amount.  Ed doesn't recall seeing this.  Do you know anything about this?  If so, please provide information to Cynthia.

Thanks
