I am doing a reconciliation on Hafslund Energy Trading for the period of November 01 thru March 03, other than December 01 all months agree.  I placed an entry in to DMS # 12596 to cover December 01.  EPMI is showing a net payable to Hafslund of $93,420, the invoice from Hafslund shows EPMI owing $66,000 for the period.  Rebecca Grace stated that a reconciliation of the scheduling sheets for December 01 is being done and this difference may be a scheduling issue.  She also stated the reconciliation will be a long process and if I supplied the carp report showing deal detail that it may help.

Thanks,

Mark
