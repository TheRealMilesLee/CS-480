Erik -

Below is a form NDA for Cargill/CommodityLogic.  The form is Cargill's form and mirrors the agreement we reached earlier this year between Cargill and NetWorks.  That agreement was negotiated with Anne Pedrero with Cargill eVentures in San Mateo, CA.  Whether or not she is the individual who should look at this agreement is up to the personnel you are dealing with at Cargill.  I would suggest, however, that if another legal person does get involved, that they be instructed to contact Ms. Pedrero to verify the terms of the agreement previously negotiated.

Please let me know if you should need anything further -- phone calls are okay.


Mark
