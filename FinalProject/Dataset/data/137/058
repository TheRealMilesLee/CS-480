Kim:
Well, I am now officially over in Rod Hayslett's group!  He had mentioned to me last Friday about your TransPecos deal as a potential source of cash for Enron (presumably through a monetization of cash flows from Pemex) - do you have some time to discuss or some material that I could take a look at over the holidays?

Thanks,

Kevin

Kim Watson has been running with this, and Eric has been chiming in every so often.

Rod mentioned this deal to me last week as a potential source of cash.  Are you the commercial lead on this? If not, do you know who is?
