No, just Thursday and Friday of this week.  I will be taking the first week in December off, though.

It probably won't be available until after the Holiday.   The reason I say that is because we haven't received the bill from Public Service yet. 

Are you out any time from now until the end of the month?

Theresa:
Do you know when the Citizens numbers will be ready for Oct. 2001?  I'm trying to get them billed before the holidays.

Thanks,
Megan
