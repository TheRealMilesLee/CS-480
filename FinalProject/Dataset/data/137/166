Thanks.
How are things looking??
If we don't have appropriate existing relationships for Anaheim, I'll just make a few calls myself...so don't worry if we don't, I just figured  if we did, we might as well use what we got! ( that was a grammatical mess!)
A quick SMUD update.... They had a few issues with the CA, which I had legal revise, and we sent them another draft.

Greetings:
Just wanted to check in to let you know that I've taken another step in getting meetings with the GM of both Anaheim and SMUD.  Will let you know.  Ain't moving at a lightening pace, but there's progress.

Best,
Jeff
