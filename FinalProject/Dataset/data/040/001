SPECIAL EVENT AT UC BERKELEY's INTERNATIONAL HOUSE
Glenn Fukushima speaking on...
"Understanding and Misunderstanding Japanese Styles of Communication" 

Wednesday, Sept. 5
5:00 - 6:00 pm
International House, Chevron Auditorium
2299 Piedmont Avenue at Bancroft Way

FREE / NO RSVP necessary

In celebration of the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Peace Treaty with Japan, International House welcomes Mr. Glen Fukushima, who will deliver a presentation entitled "Understanding and Misunderstanding Japanese Styles of Communication" on Wednesday, September 5, from 5:00 to 6:30 pm in the I-House Chevron Auditorium, 2299 Piedmont Avenue at Bancroft Way in Berkeley. This presentation is FREE to I-House residents, members, alumni, and the general public. 

Between corporations and individuals in the US and Japan, there are a plethora of cases where what one side says in not fully understood, or sometimes completely misunderstood, by the other side. This is disturbing given the numerous articles, books conferences, symposia, and studies that have proliferated during the past 50 years explaining the two countries to one and other. Of course, historical, political, economic, social, cultural and psychological differences can impede effective communication between Americans and Japanese. But beyond this, the languages of the two countries are so dissimilar that finding exact conceptual equivalents can be impossible, even with the help of the best interpreters. These are among the cross-cultural challenges Mr. Fukushima will address in his talk. Don't miss this opportunity to explore and discuss the reasons for and solutions to cross cultural differences that touch us here at International House and across the campus. 

Glen Fukushima is the leader of Japan operations for Cadence Design Systems in Silicon Valley. A native of California, Fukushima was educated at Stanford University, Harvard University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School. Fukushima's publications include Nichi-Bei Keizai Masatsu no Seijigaku (The Politics of US-Japan Economic Friction), winner of the 9th Masayoshi Ohira Memorial Prize in 1993. His writings have appeared in the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, International Herald Tribune, Japan Times and many more.
