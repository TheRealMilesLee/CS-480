Gentlemen,

Per our conversation yesterday afternoon, attached are the following referenced materials:

1)  "Benefits to Vzla of Jose LNG" -- summary of expected economic impact, derived from Bastidas Ltr (4 below)

2) "Shapiro Update" -- prepared prior to yesterday's conference call with latest contact and status info

3) "JH Jose LNG" -- prepared and presented to Bollenger/Delahunt staffers last week prior to their trip to Caracas

4)  "AdinaBastidas21" -- Aug. 6 letter (in Spanish) to Venezuelan VP

5)  "LamedaLetter" -- prepared and sent to General Lameda after meeting with him, Vincenzo Paglione, and Nelson Nava in Caracas on July 6

6)  "JoseCriticalTimingMemo06-27" -- prepared and sent to Nelson Nave and others at PDVSA Gas prior to July 6 meeting with Lameda et al

7)  "JoseChavezCallMemoJune25" -- prepared as briefing memo to Ken Lay in anticipation of arranging a call between him and President Chavez; attached to it as further background is an oldeer project description memo

8)  "Jose LNG Background Chavez Call" -- a slightly earlier version of the Lay prep memo for the President Chavez call that shows some additional info and a slightly different approach to the pitch in the call; I still think the later version is preferable, but thought you might find the contrast and additional info useful

You also may be interested to know that there is a CERA decision brief dated Aug. 2001 discussing some of the political/project development issues we discussed with you yesterday.  Please advise if you think it would be useful.

Please do not hesitate to call if you have any questions or require any further information.

Neal   office 713-345-2709;  cell 713-301-4190
