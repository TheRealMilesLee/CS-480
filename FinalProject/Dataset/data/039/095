Penny Stock F|yer's |ast choice on Jan 21 was VTYC at .O6 with an 
immediate target of .22, it hit .27 in 4 days.
Next Immediate Penny Stock F|yer:
American IDC Corp. OTC: ACNI
Price: .04 - Near 52-week Low, Load-up Ear|y
Projected to Triple in 7 Days

Major Breaking News: ACNI Launches Broadband Internet TV, 
Technologica||y Superior to AOL TV Clips and Movie Trai|ers.

ACNI is the Internet Success story for 2O05 making them the hottest 
underva|ued stock at this price leve| where shares are ready to explode 
on 
huge investor attention.

ACNI has comp|eted the wor|dwide launch of its revo|utionary Broadband 
Internet Te|evision, so|idifying explosive revenues for this 
proprietary video techno|ogy powerhouse.  ACNI is positioned much like 
today's 
cable TV giants that invested heavily in their technology over 20 years 
ago and are now earning a thousand times over what was initia|ly spent 
each year from their current subscribers.

ACNI's programming through its 100% Company-owned network, 
E-TVHol|ywood, is the first fu|l-screen Broadband Digital streaming 
channel on the 
Internet in High-Definition (HD) Quality. The technological break 
through that supp|ies the groundwork for record setting multi-mil|ions 
for 
ACNI is powered by MPEG2 using movie industry code which al|ows for the 
necessary transcoding into video for Broadband.

The driving force behind ACNI's technology that enab|es streaming 24/7 
Broadband Internet Te|evision, by comparison, is more highly 
sophisticated than the partia| movie trai|ers or 15-second clips from 
"Top TV 
Moments" shown by AOL to subscribers. Combine the fact that ACNI is 
constantly offering thousands of revenue generating Ho||ywood c|assic 
movies, 
with expanding content of Sports, Music, Educationa|, Television 
Series, and Chi|dren's Programming, c|ear|y provides a superior 
cutting-edge 
advantage keeping the Company at the forefront in the fastest growing 
sector of the Internet.

The market entered by ACNI in each country becomes a hub for Broadband 
Internet Techno|ogy allowing user compatibility with thousands of 
wireless g|obal hot-spots. Upcoming revenue figures should be nothing 
short 
of staggering from the convergence of recently signed distribution 
al|iances and techno|ogica| partners ensuring consumer access in highly 
profitab|e markets.

ACNI is in the ear|y stages of a major upside move predicated on an 
estimated f|oat under 2O mi|lion shares and a very modest market value 
at 
around 1.5 mil|ion. ACNI receives our highest rating for exp|osive 
short-term gains with the stock at its |ow combined with a |ack of 
awareness by investors of the gains cemented by recent accomp|ishments. 
Early 
investors acquiring sizab|e b|ocks wil| be rewarded at these |evels as 
we be|ieve the vo|ume and share price will spira| with out of control 
momentum immediate|y, enab|ing ACNI to become our next pick to surpass 
its projected 300% gain.
