ERCOT has been improperly identified as the Source Generator and Load or Sink Entity on NERC Tags.  ERCOT does not own generation, nor does it consume energy as defined by NERC.  The QSE's responsible for the transactions need to be identified on the NERC Tags.  Therefore, beginning with schedules submitted for September 4, 2001, ERCOT will no longer approve NERC Tags that list ERCOT as the Source Generator or Load or Sink Entity.  Please ensure that all personnel responsible for submitting NERC Tags are aware of this.
Review the attached file as an example.  If you have any questions or concerns, call me at (512) 225-7135.  Thanks, 
Leo
