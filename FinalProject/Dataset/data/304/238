Hi,

I'm sending this email because I recieved a 5% refinance rate on my home, I had leftover money
after the financing went through and used the money to pay off my credit card debts and buy a new boat.
You have the oppurtunity to get this same deal and use it on other expenditures; cars, vacations, plastic surgery included.

Visit the site below for more information.
