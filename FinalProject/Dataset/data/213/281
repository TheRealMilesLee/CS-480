Hi Lindy!  Laura McGuire and I were talking about you today.  Remember we
were working on Florabama and we met her for lunch and it was pouring down
rain?!  She was in my office today for a meeting and it took us a while to
remember how we knew each other.  She got married in January; I think her
new last name is Heckman.

Anyway, I was thinking about you and I hope you're doing well thru all this
Enron mess.  How is Sam?  talking up a storm already?

Take care--

Susan
