Have they been terminated?  Our file is as of 11/30, but if they have not terminated, the value could be vastly different from that file.

I just wanted to verify that the following parties are out of the money (as of 11/30/01):

Compania Minera Autlan
Copamex
Galvak

I was told that these are now in the money to ENA.
