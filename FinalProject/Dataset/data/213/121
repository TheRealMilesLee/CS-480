Following up on a "to do" that I took on last Friday, and in response to Chris' prompting of yesterday--thanks Chris--attached is a generic form of the short term capacity release agreement that we entered into with Transwestern for remainder of January business.  

Please feel free to forward this form to other pipelines who are inquiring about short term releases for February business.  Please note that is contains a 50/50 sharing of upside if the pipeline releases the capacity for more than ENA's contract rate.  Delete that feature before sending, if you don't what to offer such an incentive.
