I work for Jeff Donahue in corporate development.  I spoke to Bill Glass, Chief Credit officer of UBSW and hed like to meet tentatively at 8 am tomorrow morning in 49c2/c3 at 8 am.  Hopefully, you are available to address their questions.  I understand that you have been speaking directly to Bill heretofore.
