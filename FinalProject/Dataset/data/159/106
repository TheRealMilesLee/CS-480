Hey Errol,

Just trying to get a handle on who's left in your group - can you just
shoot me a quick list so I know who to call on your side....

We're left with:

Patrick Mulvany
Jean Bell
Jason Fischer
Todd Delahoussaye
Diane Anderson

on the financial side.  

We haven't yet figured out who's doing what - especially on the
brokered stuff, since both my broker checkout people got let go.....
but...we'll figure something out.  

Talk to you later,
Diane
