We're on the 5th floor of the new building--it was full--there's only about 20% of us left.  I've never been through anything like this, so yesterday was very hard for both Paula (she's still here, too!) and myself--to watch alot of our group walking out the door.  It's pretty quiet here, too.

Still here.  Pretty quiet on the floor though.  How hard did your area get hit?

I saw you in the parking garage this morning.  So, you survived the first round, too, huh?
