What a neighborhood!!  The pictures were wonderful.  I knew I wouldn't have any trouble printing the .jpg files, but I was surprised how easy it was to print from the .pdf file.  Each picture was a page.  I'm explaining that this is a test case: we want to see if District D can solve problems for us.  Ada Edwards has a great idea to set up a little neighborhood office next to the storefront police station.  I'm willing to help, but only if we can get results.  We don't need a public relations gimmick.
