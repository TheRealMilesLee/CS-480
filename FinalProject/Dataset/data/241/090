Dear Friend,

I wish the best in life for you and your family, and I hope you will
receive this mail in good spirit and respond quickly with  ultmost
secrecy and confidentiality,

I got your address through my professional relationship in discharging
my duties for my government. My name is Col.ANTHONY JOHNSON and I was
the chief of security and operations for former president Charles Taylor
of  Liberia.

Please protect this mail for the safety of my life and that of my
family to avoid us being ortured or killed by his left behind secret 
agents.

Please i humbly beg you from the bottom of my heart to listen very
carefully, the situation in my country is very critical and chaos,  
uproar and hostilitieshad brought the country to its knees and from
intelligent report the center cannot hold anymore for former president
Charles Taylor and his government.

The intense pressure from United States, United Nations, International
community and west African peace keeping to[Ecomog] had made him [fomer
president Charles Taylor] to step aside and gone on exile and also
pressure to face war crime charges against humanity. Listen very 
carefully, you know my country Liberia is very rich with diamonds,and with my
position as former chief of security and operations I have accumulated 
so much diamonds which I had sold to generate close to $30 Million over the
years and it is this fund that I want to move to you for safe keeping.

The fund are in boxes in dollar denomination and it would be sent you
through diplomatic courier service with your name as the beneficiary
within few days.Please would you do me a favour to receive this fund for
me? Else the government in power will seize the fund and plunder it.

If you are capable and know that you will truly and honestly help
me, write me now, time is no more on my side.

I will give you 30% of the fund and I will come to your country to take
my part. Extend a friendly hand and help me.
Please bear in mind that this fund  is not a looted or stolen money but rather a hard earned money
generated.


Pls if you are willing to help kindly forward to me your personal
detail to enable me reach you this includes the following:


 1. Your full names

 2. Your  residential address

 3. Your occupation

 4. Premable about yourself (marital status)

I urgently await your reply

Your's Sincerly,


COL.ANTHONY JOHNSON
