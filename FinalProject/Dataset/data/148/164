Michael,

If you are not the proper person to receive this request will you please
forward it to the proper person within your organization.

We have recently made significant changes to our credit policy and we have
requested all customers be compliant with the credit policy by December 15
of this year.  I have attached a copy of the credit policy reflecting these
changes for your review.

After reviewing your company's last 24 calendar months of activity it would
appear that we will need a letter of credit in the amount of at least
$100,000 for you to be compliant with the terms of the policy.  Approved
language for the letter of credit is at the end of the credit policy as
attachment 2.  The issuing bank must also be acceptable to SPP and these
requirements can be located in the financial security section of the policy
under Letter of Credit.  Also, we have mailed and emailed the policy with a
request to send back the credit agreement.  I have also attached a copy of
this agreement.  If you would have it signed and sent back as well it would
be greatly appreciated.
