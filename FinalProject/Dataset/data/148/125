FTC, FDA, AND STATES WARN WEB SITES SELLING
BIOTERRORISM-RELATED PRODUCTS
An Internet surf by federal and state officials has
uncovered Web sites touting products and therapies claiming
to prevent, treat, or cure anthrax, smallpox, and other
health hazards and has resulted in nearly 40 letters from
the Federal Trade Commission warning the operators of these
sites to pull the unsubstantiated information immediately,
the agency revealed Nov. 19.

INSURERS' LIABILITY MAY HINGE ON MULTI-VEHICLE SALES
PRACTICE
The viability of a suit charging California insurers with
violating the Cartwright Act and the Unfair Competition Act
by requiring multi-vehicle policyholders to purchase more
uninsured motorist insurance than is needed or desired may
depend on whether the insurer issues a single policy in
multi-vehicle situations or allows the insured to purchase a
separate policy for each vehicle, according to a decision by
the California Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District
("Smith v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., "Cal. Ct.
App., 2d Dist., No. B136688, 11/2/01).
