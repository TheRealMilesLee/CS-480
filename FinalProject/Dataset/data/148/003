Jaime,
 
Here is where we stand.  While they look at the language, I will be getting a little ahead by building all the elements in our TEST database for the purpose of testing.  For your knowledge, the pieces that take the longest are legal review and testing.  However, on this particular product/product type, we will be building everything from scratch.  We are not typically faced with this requirement, but we will get it done as quickly as possible.  Let me know if you have questions.
 
Kevin

Kevin:
 
I wanted to be sure to touch base with you before the holidays.  I forwarded the Swaption to Brent Hendry last week.  The power components of the product is already done -- the floating price language -- so the only piece requiring review is strictly financial.  I will review as well but need Brent's comments.
