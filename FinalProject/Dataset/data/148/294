This is not something Gloria has been involved with (that I know of) but thought you should see.

Gloria,

I was out of the office on Wednesday November 21st when this message arrived.  I spoke with Laura Prothro, Director Accounting, who advised me that the payment in question was wire transfered to PJM on Wednesday November 21st.  Laura indicated that she would phone PJM representatives, Molly Lynch or Lisa Drauschak, to verify that payment was received by PJM.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Richard
