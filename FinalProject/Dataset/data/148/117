Kim

Payroll will print out a hard copy of his Nov 15th check today and forward that to his office.  It is too late to change his Nov 30th check but we will print one on Friday and forward that one too.

The HR Service Connection Team will process the change in the system so that hard copies will be delivered beginning with December.

Veronica & Payroll:  Jeff Shankman (EGM COO) would like to have a hard copy of his Nov 15th check and a hard copy going forward, could you please advise how we might be able to accommodate this request?  Jeff is part of our Office of the Chair, so I want to be sure to double check all possibilities. 

Please advise.

Thank you,
Kim Hickok

Kim-

I believe November 15th was the start of online paycheck stubs through EHRONLINE for those who are on direct deposit however, Jeff would like to receive hard copies of his paycheck stubs including Nov. 15th.  Can you help us with this?

Thank you!
Jennifer
