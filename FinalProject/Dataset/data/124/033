STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
From the Desk of: Mr.Ade Folarin
{GM, Corporate & Investment Banking}
Chartered Bank Plc, Nigeria.
E-mail: folarin@portugalmail.com

Dear Friend,

Permit me to introduce myself to you. My name is Mr.Ade J.P Folarin,
GM,Corporate & Investment Banking with Chartered Bank Plc, Nigeria.
Lagos-Nigeria.

This letter may come to you as a surprise since it is coming from
someone you have not met before and due to high volume of Spam mail that
goes around the world through this means but I have no other choice than
to send it to you through the internet means, Therefore, I will
appreciate it if you honor it and give me all your trust and full
co-operation.

I came to know about you in my private search for a reliable
person/company to handle a confidential transaction on behalf of my
Colleagues and myself. As a matter of fact, I got your contact from the
world trade center (WTC) Regional office in Lagos, Nigeria.Although the
details of my intention was not made known to them.

Proposition

A America Mr. Frederick M. Wong, 54 years of age who is an America Oil
consultant/contractor with NNPC had in our Bank the sum of US$5m in a
domiciliary account. He named his wife, Mrs. Lilla C. Wong as the next
of kin. Unfortunately, two of them died in a plane crash involving
Egyptair990, you can confirm it yourself via website below:
www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html

Efforts had been made by the management of my Bank through the American
Embassy in Lagos to contact any of the deceased children but to no
avail, as we were made to understand that the couple had no children.
Given the skeletal information available to the Bank, it has so far been
impossible to reach any of the relatives. The option left for the Bank
managementis to declare the deceased account dormant and revert the
funds to trading on behalf of and in the interest of the Bank.

In Nigeria, and almost all other parts of African continent, when Banks 
acquire funds such as that of Mr. Frederick M. Wong, they are required
by law to donate 30% of the funds on acquisition to The Trust Fund For
Arms And Ammunitions. Arms and ammunitions purchased with funds from the
Trust Fund are used to further enhance the course of war in Africa and
invariably turbulence of some sort in the world in general.

It is therefore in order to avoid/avert and discourage this negative
development that my Colleagues and I now seek your assistance to have
you stand as a distant relative {Next Of Kin} to Mr. and Mrs. Frederick
M. Wong, so that the funds would be released to you. All documents and
proofs to enable you get the funds will be carefully packaged once we
receive your consent on this proposal.

May I assured you that this Transaction is 100% safe and risk-free, as
we have taken care of all necessary modalities to ensure a hitch-free
transaction.

I have the authority of my partners involved in this transaction to
propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction your
share would be 40% of the US$5million, 60% for us.

I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not
disappoint me.
Best Regards.

Mr.ADE  FOLARIN
{GM, Corporate & Investment Banking}.
