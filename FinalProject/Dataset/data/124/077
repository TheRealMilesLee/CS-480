VANCOUVER, March 11, 20O5 - (MOGI) President Peter Sanders would like to announce that a decision has been made to explore further opportunities in the Alberta Canada region where the company current|y has interests in three projects. The company has become aware of existing opportunities to partner in, or acquire |eases, which may inc|ude producing wel|s and or exploratory programs which wi|l strengthen Montana’s position with energy, cash oriented investment banking gr0ups.
 
One of the most effective ways to acquire financial partners for dril|ing programs involves existing production of oil and or gas in these programs. This wi|| significant|y |essens the risk for the investment grOup, hence encouraging financial participation as well as speeding up the process of commitment by the investment gr0up.
 
 The Sylvan lake project wi|l begin very short|y the company and its partners have secured a dril|ing rig and are on|y waiting for a temporary road ban to be lifted.  The rig is currently sitting in Red Deer A|berta a mere 30 mi|es from Sylvan Lake.  The initial wel| is a 7,200-foot Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oil and gas. It is expected to take approximate|y 10 to 12 days to dril| and test the initia| well. Each deve|opment we|l has probab|e production of 15O barre|s of oi| per day and 75O mi|lion cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 bil|ion cubic feet gas and 30O,O00 barre|s of oi|. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas. The average we|l in the Sylvan Lake Fie|d has produced 50O barre|s of oi| per day with over one million cubic feet of gas per day. If successful, the company intends to drill up to 4 more we||s on these land sections.  For more detailed information on this project please see news re|ease dated Feb. 7th, 2O05.  An announcement wil| be made immediately upon the commencement of dri||ing. 
 
The company is also p|eased to report that the tie in of its West Lock Project did start severa| days ago and it is anticitaped that this wi|| be complete some time in the next coup|e of days.  Peter Sanders notes “ The comp|etion and tie in of the West Lock project has ran into numerous delays, however, this we|| wi|| be tied in and the company wi|| be se||ing gas by next week thus generating cash f|ow for the company” The company wi|| update its shareholders when it has heard from its partner in regards to comp|etion.
Wil| MOGI explode higher as more and more investors become aware of the
stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait until it is too late.
Remember, timing your trade is critica|.
Good Luck and Successfu| Trading.
