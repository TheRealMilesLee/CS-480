Theresa,

We are trying to ensure that we have the correct imbalances on the G/L for FUGG.  Can you confirm these balances or let me know what the true imbalances should be since they were not in Unify during this time?    Also, what is supposed to happen to these imbalances. - did they go over to Northern Border or will they ever be settled?  Thanks!
