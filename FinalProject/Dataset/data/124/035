My name RICHARD  BENSON, the eldest son of Dr. ENAGUA BENSON, from Zimbabwe. =
This letter might come as a surprise to you about where I got your contact =
address and how I knew you. I got your address from the net, and i decided to =

our
President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned farms for his party =
members and his followers,  he ordered all white farmers to surrender all =
their farms to his party members and his followers. 
My father was one of the biggest farmers in our country and because he =
strongly opposed Mugabe's ideas,  Mugabe's supporters invaded my father's =
farm and burnt everything in the farm, killing my father and made away with a =
lot of items in my father's farm. 
Before his death, my father had deposited with one Security Company in SOUTH =
AFRICA, the sum of US$15.5 (Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United =
States Dollars). This was money he planned to use in buying new machinery and =
to set up a new farm in Swaziland. After the death of my father,  l decided =
to escape to Netherlands because of continued harassment from Mugabe and his =
supporters. 
As  the senior man in the Family, l decided to contact   you to assist me =
since I was able to  moved this money out of SOUTH AFRICA to Holland for safe =
keeping although the courier comapny were not aware of the content of the =
suite case because it was convey as personal valuable goods, 
Presently the Fund is already in Holland, while I need to seek political  =
asylum to secure my staying here and we are not allowed to operate any bank =
account within Netherlands. For your role in this transaction, me and my =
family have agreed to offer you 25%  of the total sum for your assistance, 5% =
will be mapped out for any expenses that may be incurred in the course of =
this transaction and 70% will be for me and my family to invest in your =
country. 
All I want you to do is to help me finish this transaction and the same time =
help me to invest the money into a lucrative business in your country Please =
get back to me if you can be of assistance  and l would want our =
correspondence to be via email as  most phone lines of  asylums  seekers are =
presently bugged  by the Government.
 l expect your confidentiality and your prompt  respond to this email so as =
to proceed.
Note that this transaction is 100% risk free. You should however treat this =
transaction with absolute confidentiality.please forward your phone/fax =
numbers and your address to my private Email address at: =
richardbenson406@netscape.net 
Thanks and God bless.
