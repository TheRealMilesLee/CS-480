Yes, we should have anticipated it.   No head's up.
We have little recourse legally.   Lisa and I are recommending to exit gracefully.

Hi Michael:
Few questions:

Is this something that we anticipated? Were we given any sort of "head's up?" 
Is it something that we can object to?  The combination is far from consummated and we're still owed a heckuvalot of money? 
Do we have any recourse?

Best,

Jeff
