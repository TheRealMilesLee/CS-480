Mr. Lay

I understand that you have been a very busy man an probably did not read the message below or someone probably screened it, deleted it, or dismissed it. It is not to be dismissed. The hallowed ground that I spoke on below played a major part in the success of the company. Less than one month after I Identified this fact things have spiraled down even further.  Please take the time to consider the information below. Although a new face may run the entity Enron the company exists through its original premise. A company that you and all its employees help build. If at all possible I would like to sit down and talk with you about my perception of the current situation and things to come. 

Respectfully David

Ken, please read

My prayers go out with you as grab the wheel of this ship and try to get it back onto smoother waters However, I am currently enduring my own issues in house. I am sending this note to point out that some basic values in our organization are lacking. I only want to point out to you my example of the ambiguity of excellence. I attempted to attend the all employee meeting but was turned away at the door. The reason was I lost my badge during a business trip last week. A Mr. Alex Varez (director security) informed me that no one can enter the meeting without an Enron ID badge. So I waited and watched. I watched as three gentleman were let in by a Mr. Steve Kane or Kean. I questioned Mr. Varez and a Mr. Mark Jeffries as to what criterion did the rules change. He stated Mr. Kane/Kean vouched for the gentlemen. Of course I left and hurried back to listen to your assessment and write this e-mail. The fundamentals are often waived just like the entry of the three gentlemen who where allowed in the meeting. The sad part is that I have been here almost five years and shook the hands of 5 people entering the meeting all who could have vouched for me. However, in this example knowing the right person mattered. The rules did not apply equally. I said all this to say now more than ever you need to drive home our values. And force a wholesome discipline throughout our organization. It appears that the management team is looking at external indicators instead of internal indicators. If we feel our values are being delivered in-house then the collective "we" will change external perceptions. 

Here is some food for thought that will assist in changing the direction of Enron. I do not know if you are a God fearing man. However, my intuition says you are. The foundation of the EBN is on blessed ground, the earth is old church property. I don't know if you ever considered that but I am relatively sure that it is fact. Any business within the walls on this ground is in a better position to prosper. I am not sure if the new building is on the blessed grounds. It could be beneficial to have the new building blessed. An old tradition for future success. For me it is the basic premise for success as we move forward.

Respectfully, David Tonsall
