Dear Friend, 

My name is SALIM IBRAHIM a merchant in Dubai, in 
the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer 
It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right 
now I have only about a few months to live, according to
medical experts. 

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I 
never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my 
business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, 
I was always hostile to people and only focused on my 
business as that was the only thing I cared for. But 
now I regret all this as I now know that there is more 
to life than just wanting to have or make all the money
in the world. 

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to 
this world I would live my life a different way from 
how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I 
have willed and given most of my property and assets 
to my immediate and extended family members as well as 
a few close friends. 

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, 
I have decided to give also to charity organizations, as
I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. 
So far, I have distributed money to some charity 
organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. 
Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot 
do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my 
family to close one of my accounts and distribute the 
money which I have there to charity organization in 
Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the 
money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them 
anymore, as they seem not to be contended with 
what I have left for them. 

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge 
cash deposit of (Twenty million five hundred thousand u.s dollars) 
that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad.
I will want you to help me collect this consignment and 
dispatched it to charity organizations. I have set aside 15% for 
you,then 5% for any expenses insured. 
God be with you. 

SALIM IBRAHIM 

NOTE: please my friend, becuase of security reasons kindly 
respond back to me via my most confidential email box at 

ibrahim_salim@ care2.com

I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR URGENT RESPONCE. 
THANKS ALOT, MAY THE GOOD GOD BLESS YOU ABONDANTLY
