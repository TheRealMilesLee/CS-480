TOP STORY: BUDGET BUMPS SECURITY FUNDING, OTHER ACCOUNTS MIXED
President Bush released his budget yesterday for fiscal year 2003, calling 
for more homeland security spending but cuts in non-defense environmental 
projects. Bush called for a $300 million cut in appropriations for the U.S. 
EPA (story #1). And the president called for a slight reduction in the 
Interior budget, meaning the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service 
will see budget cuts. (story #2). But the Bush administration is requesting 
a 40 percent increase in its 2003 Yucca Mountain Project budget. (story #3)
