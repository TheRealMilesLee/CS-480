"The idea is, you memorize these things, then write them down in little exam books, then forget them. If you fail to forget them, you become a professor and have to stay in college for the rest of your life.  -- Dave Barry",
"Screw the dead!  What did their mouldering asses ever do for me?  -- \"Homicide\" Detective Mike Kellerman",
"Life is just a continuous process of getting used to things you didn't expect.",
"I'm not panicking.  I'm watching you panic.  It's much more entertaining.",
"Poverty is not the root (\"rut\") cause of crime.  -- Rush Limbaugh",
"Cinemuck, sniglet:  Popcorn, soda, and candy that covers the floors of movie theaters.",
"Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement I kind of lost track myself.  -- Dirty Harry",
"My life is better than an ABBA song!  -- Muriel's Wedding", "Questions are not a rejection of prior beliefs.  They are merely a backup of an existing hypothesis.  -- Sean Tompkins",
"Society has long been hostile to intellectuals, suspecting them of everything from moral weakness and dangerous scepticism to communist conspiracy and venereal disease, but never has it been quite so explicit in pursuing the opposite prejudice, the moral elevation of simple-mindedness.  We North Americans find ourselves, on the brink of the third millenium, living in a high-tech society in which, paradoxically, stupidity is our brightest badge of goodness.  -- Mark Kingwell, Dreams of Millennium",
