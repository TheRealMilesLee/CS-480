Dear Members of the Haas Community:

As I'm sure many of you have noticed, it was erroneously reported by email last Friday and in Haas Week today that Dean Tyson would continue serving as dean of the Haas School through the end of the academic year.  Professor Tyson will resign her position as dean at the end of December 2001 as she had planned.  Associate Dean Ben Hermalin will begin serving as interim dean of the Haas School on January 1, 2002, and will continue in that role until the Chancellor's choice of a new dean is announced.

The Dean's Office received an email from Vice Provost Jan de Vries announcing the formation of a search committee to select the new dean and a request that it be distributed to the Haas community.  The Provost's memo misstated the date of Dean Tyson's resignation.   Unfortunately, staff in the Dean's Office did not notice the error until after the news had been released.

The Dean's Office will forward a revised memo from Vice Provost de Vries regarding the Dean's Search Committee when it is received.

Marybeth Schubert
Deputy Dean
