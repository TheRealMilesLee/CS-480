Pam:
Good news, someone came by last week in regard to the TV cable but, he got away before I could introduce myself and ask about the installation and timing.

Please advise (a date) when we can expect both the TV monitor and desk top copier.  Thanks.

Pam:

As a follow up to our call today, please obtain a specific date that we can expect the TV monitor set-up.  It would be a shame to install cable and TV set-up and move in the next month.  

Also note that I have not heard from Iain regarding options on the table top desk copier.  Please advise status and date of expected delivery.

Thank you for your assistance.
