Barry,

I will have September actuals ready on Wednesday.  Let me know if you want to meet then to discuss.

Also, Louise has reviewed the headcount plan submitted for 2002 and asked that we reduce the West Origination count by one.  The attached file shows what was initially submitted.  If you will let me know what position to eliminate, I will make the necessary adjustments.

 

Thanks,
Laynie
