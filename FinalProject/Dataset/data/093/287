I'm thinking the week of November 5-7 because I thought I would be in Toronto and now I don't have to go.  I'd like to do Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama and Venezuela in one big trip.  Help me with logistics here.  I know there are a couple of places in Venezuela, but where else did you need me and are we trying to combine any of these offices?
