In preparation to present offers to APS, Duke, and Panda, the following tasks need to be completed-

James, Teb, Blair to calculate rates for $911 MM facilities according to the following guidelines-

- Rate matrix based on contract terms of 15/20/25/30 years 
- Project depreciation consistent with contract term
- Segmented rates (max rate)
- Levelized
- Volume allocations: SJ-780k/d; Cal Border-330k/d; Phoenix;500k/d
- Incremental O&M costs charged to new shippers prior to next rate case; O&M costs re-allocated based on expected outcome following next rate case.
- Incremental fuel retention charged to new shippers prior to next rate case; fuel costs re-allocated based on expected outcome following next rate case.
- Determine rate sensitivity (for 15/20/25/30 year terms) assuming +/- $25 MM change in cost of new facilities
- Determine rate sensitivity (for 15/20/25/30 year terms) assuming +/- $2 MM change in O+M re-allocated based on expected outcome following next rate case.

Kevin to provide capital structure and cost of debt, cost of equity (in light of recent circumstances) in support of new rate analyses.

Eric, Kevin, Lorraine and Michelle to outline commercial transaction structures for APS, Duke, and Panda.  Eric to schedule meeting to discuss rate indexation.

Eric to schedule next team meeting asap (target=Nov 1).
