please confirm that we are set up with the ISO so that all that matters is the telemetry between us and the load.
 
thanks,

In case any interruptible load customers are requesting information on how we would certify them to provide ancillaries see below for a step by step process.  Thanks, - Mike

Subject: LaaR Registration




Loads Acting as a Resource are to register as follows: 

As per Protocol 16.5:  "Any Generation Resource connected to the ERCOT Transmission System, any distributed generation over 1 MW, or a Load Acting as a Resource must register with ERCOT."

As this protocol is written the legal owner of the load is to register.  

The legal owner will complete and submit the following, either as a LaaR (with real-time telemetry requirements to QSE) or BUL

1.  Resource Application and ERCOT Standard Form Agreement 
<http://www.ercot.com/mkt_part_apps/market_participant_application_f.htm> 

2. Resource applicant completes ERCOT Standard Form Agreement sent after application is approved. 

3.  Loads Acting as a Resource Asset Registration Form, registering each load point 
<http://www.ercot.com/mkt_part_apps/market_participant_application_f.htm> 


Upon receipt of the Resource Application, the registering entity will be assigned an ERCOT Client Service Representative to assist in completing the processes.  The LaaR (as a Resource entity) designates a QSE on the application and completes a QSE acknowledgement.  The LaaR Asset Registration Form identifies both the QSE and LSE relations with the LaaR.

Before participating in the market the LaaR and designated QSE will complete the following (LaaR with real-time telemetry requirements to QSE):

1.  Complete telemetry requirements to QSE 
2.  Designated QSE complete RTU technical test of LaaR RTU points with ERCOT 
3.  Designated QSE completes LaaR qualification with ERCOT (to be specified) 

Settlement Metering Requirements 

1. The TDSP has the responsibility for ensuring that all LaaR ESI IDs are interval data recorder (IDR) metered.  (Protocols Section 10.9)

2. The TDSP has the responsibility to provide interval data for the LaaR facility on at least a monthly basis.  (Protocols Section 10.2.2)   Alternatively, (once PIP 198 has been implemented) the TDSP can establish LaaR metering points providing greater than 10 MWs as an EPS meter point by complying with all ERCOT Protocols for EPS metering.  

3. Since ERCOT systems are designed to receive a single consumption value per ESI ID, the TDSP must combine readings where multiple meters exist.  Alternatively, each meter point can be registered as a separate LaaR facility and separate ESI ID.  


Needing further clarification: 
ERCOT is investigating further the registration issues of aggregated LaaR(BUL) with multiple legal entities and LaaR(BUL)s within NOIE service areas.  ERCOT will update market participants on these issues as soon as possible.

For assistance in completing the LaaR Asset Registration form please contact Client Relations at 512 248-3900 or an ERCOT Client Representative.

Thank you!
