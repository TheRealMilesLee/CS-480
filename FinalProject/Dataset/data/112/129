Good afternoon, Mark.

Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you on the 15th and regale you
with the background and talents of Christian Schutz.  Just following up to
see if there are any opportunities within your offices that you would be
interested in speaking with him about.  Christian is extremely motivated to
get to Denver and asked that I follow up with you.

Thank you and best regards,
