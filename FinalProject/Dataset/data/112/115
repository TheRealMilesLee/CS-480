Subject: Firm Transport on Transwestern for November


Transwestern is in agreement with extending your Firm transport from
Griffith to PG&E, with alternate delivery at Southwest Gas.  The term is
November for 15,000 at a rate of .05, all inclusive with zero fuel.
Regulatory needs a paragraph substitution (see below) and unfortunately
Contracts will issue a new number because of the changes.  Please submit
a new Service Request and I will approve.  Thanks.


Substitute:

"For the term of this amendment, if any quantities nominated by Shipper
hereunder cannot be scheduled because of an event of Force Majeure,
Transwestern shall further discount the rate applicable to such
quantities nominated but not scheduled to zero."

In place of:

For the term of this Amendment, Transwestern agrees to provide an
additional discount to the Shipper for quantities that could not be
scheduled hereunder due to an event of Force Majeure, as reasonably
determined by Transwestern, rendering the supplies unavailable.  The
additional discount will be an amount equal to any quantities made
unavailable multiplied by the Discounted Rate.
