By participating in these interviewing opportunities you will become key to the selection process that will ultimately become your talent pool.  In each Decision Meeting we will also track which business units/departments wish to bring a certain candidate into their area.  This will give you the chance to hand-pick your new talent.  Please confirm to me via e-mail the dates your team members will participate.
