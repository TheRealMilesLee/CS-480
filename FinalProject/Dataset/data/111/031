Question Two:
No.  Enron's lobbying expenditures is very consistent with other entities in its field.  In addition, because of Enron's diverse portfolio of business investments it has a broad and diverse set of public policy interests.  Enron's DC expenditures also reflect the presence of our regulatory efforts.
 
Question Three:
At the Federal level Enron's public policy advocacy costs will be approximately the same in CY200l.  

Question Four:
Similar to other companies, Enron constantly alters its use of outside consultants depending on our needs at that time.  All firms we have retained should have registrations on file.   

Question Five:
Far from unusual, Linda Robertson was hired following a lengthy search in November 2000 to replace the retiring head of the DC office.

Question Six:
Don't believe so.

Question Eight:
We anticipate that the SEC inquiry will be handled by Enron's legal department.
