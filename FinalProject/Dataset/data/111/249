Tana,

I just wanted to follow up on this issue to see if we can simply move these deals over to "Not to be confirmed.''

Tana,

These deals are purely for storage.  They used tagg to capture the value of storing the physical gas.  Pat Ryder in Risk Management put these deals in and has told me they are used for value and should be "Not to be Confirmed."  If you see no issue, I will simply change their status to "Not to be Confirmed."  If their status of being under EGM is still a problem, Pat said you could call him at 5-3313.  


Thanks,

Patrick

Patrick,

Can we track down who/how these trades are getting entered into the system?  Is there someone entering the trades into the system?  Is this just an old counterparty/book set up in GCP that needs to get renamed.  Legal (me) has no idea why trades are being done out of EGM.  Can we find out who is doing them?

I think this refers to gas daily trades between Risk Management and Trade (which is an Enron entity set up for state tax reasons) and EGM (which may be a company code for Enron North America Corp. formerly known as Enron Gas Marketing, Inc.).  If this is the case, we should document them under the Master between ENA and RMT.  However, this is up to Legal.

I also got an email back from Bill Bradford, head of Credit that siad this doesn't make sense.  Maybe you need to prepare a print out of the trades and send to debbie, me & bill.

	No idea. EGM doesn't exist.

Does anyone in Credit know the answer to this question, as I don't?

Tana,

There are about 20-30 deals in pending sent to legal status that are Riskmantra vs. EGM.  My question is should we even be doing trades with Enron Gas Marketing.  And if we should, can we set up an ISDA with RMT with an effective date of 9/5/01?

Thanks,

Patrick
