Haas Community,

This evening at about 5:00 p.m. we received a report that several piles of 
white powder were placed throughout the Student Services Building and on 
Gayley Plaza.  We barricaded as much of it as we could and the UCPD and the 
Fire Department responded to our call.  We quickly discovered that the 
white powder was plain flour that had been placed in Haas and across campus 
by a student Ping Pong club on a cross campus footrace.

The student group is in the processing of cleaning up all of the piles of 
white powder.  If you find any piles in the building that were missed, 
please let us know so that we can get it all cleaned up right away.
