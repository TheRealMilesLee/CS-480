Sharon, did one of the Canadian lawyers look at the list for the things you could not identify?

Tana, the Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement which I forwarded to you earlier is the 3rd last agreement on their list [so I'm not sure what #1 on their list is].  I'm not sure what the 2nd and 3rd agreements on their list are either.

We do, however, have an Interruptible Agreement dated May 26/94 [not on their list] and a Firm (<31 Day) Gas P/S Agreement dated August 1/94 [which is, I think, #5 on their list] with Amoco Canada Petroleum Company Ltd. (now BP Canada Energy Company).  Do you want copies of these agreements?

I don't know what the other agreements are.

Sharon,

BP prepared a list of all the agreements they thought we had in place.  You might want to do a quick check and make sure that you are not missing any Canadian contracts they might have listed on this list.

THANKS FOR YOUR QUICK RESPONSE!
