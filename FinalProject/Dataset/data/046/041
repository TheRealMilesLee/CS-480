Hello Mark

We are migrating the revamped Clickpaper application to production and we would like to have some guidence of how to handle our obligations, if any, to Ariba the vendor who supplied the original software engine for Clickpaper.  As we are replacing all of the Ariba application with our the EOL application we no long rely on Ariba for the application.  

Below are some questions we have regarding how we should proceed with notifying Ariba:

1)	We will stop displaying their logo and text in our alliances section on the site.  Do we need to notify them?
2) 	What communication should we send to Ariba regarding our descision to terminate service?
3) 	How much do we owe them based on Early Termination.

Plus any other action you think necessary.  Attached is our contract with Ariba.  Please call me if you have any questions at 5-2824.

Regards,

Robbie Pateder
ENW-IT

Robbie - here is the contract with Ariba we were discussing yesterday.  Just want to get legal coverage of a couple of issues regarding how we should proceed once we stop using Ariba for clickpaper.com.

- we will stop displaying their logo and text in our alliances section on the site.  do we need to notify them?
- i will send them the final accounting of transactions cleared through the ariba software at the end of 3rd quarter (they invoice us for a small fee for each transaction.)  I assume no further communication with Ariba will be required on my part.
- need to determine if we need to take any steps for contract termination, or simply let the arrangement expire next spring.  presumably we do not want to renew, nor do we want to terminate early on the small chance someone might want to use the licenses in the meantime.
 
Please let me know what questions you have...

thanks
KNC
