Dear Sir/Madam,

My sincere apologies if this email does not meet your business and person=
al
ethics. I will introduce myself as a staff in the accounts management sec=
tion
of a well-known bank here in the United Kingdom.

One of our accounts with a balance of =A315,000,000 (Fifteen Million Brit=
ish
Pounds) has been a dormant account and not been operated for the past 4
years.

From my investigations, the owner of this account, a foreigner, Austin Ma=
rtins
died in August 2000 and since then nobody has done anything as regards th=
e
claiming of this money because he has no family members who are aware of
the existence of neither the account nor the funds. Also information from=

the Home Office shows that he was also single on entry into the UK.

I have secretly discussed this matter with some of the bank officials and=

we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. We thus
propose to do business with you, standing in as the next of kin of these
funds from the deceased and funds released to you after due processes hav=
e
been followed.

This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is a le=
gitimate
and does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other
illegal act. If you are interested, let me hear from you.


Regards,

Gordon.
