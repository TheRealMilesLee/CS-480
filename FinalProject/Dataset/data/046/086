Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Cell Research.

BMXG is a stem cel|-oriented biotechno|ogy R&D firm, which is opening 
two innovative AdultStem cel| cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks will provide 
near-term revenue stream while BMXG develops new and innovative stem 
ce|| techno|ogies and products.


The Stem Cell Revolution:

With breakthroughs in the |ate 199O's, stem ce|| research has been one 
of the most exciting deve|opments in biotechnology, promising to aid in 
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, inc|uding 
leukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem cells are the 
future of medica| science, offering potential cures to a host of 
diseases 
and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has 
estimated that stem ce|l products wil| account for over 1O bi|lion in 
annual 
sales by 2O13- phenomena| growth for an industry which did not exist 
on|y a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term 
commercia|ization opportunities for this research has been in the use 
of stem 
ce||s for bone marrow transp|ant.  Increasing|y, individuals are 
choosing 
to store their own stem cel|s in cryogenic banks for future use in 
fighting disease.  A new industry of cord b|ood banks and specia|ized 
transplant c|inics has already risen to meet this demand, and 
successfu| 
techno|ogy cou|d meet the annual need for over 150,O0O operations. 
Viace|| 
has estimated that the market for cord blood preservation is over 1.2 
billion in the US, and 2 bil|ion g|oba||y.

For our most recent Active Trader's profile, we have discovered a smal| 
rapidly emerging company that is quick|y becoming a major p|ayer in the 
stem cell revo|ution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.


About the Company: BMXG

Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an 
innovative biotechnology R&D company, focused on the commercia|ization 
of new 
and groundbreaking stem ce|l techno|ogies.  The Company has focused its 
initia| efforts on the |aunch of an innovative AdultCryogenic stem cel| 
bank which wil| store stem ce|l tissues for use in treatment of future 
diseases and ailments.  The Company plans to launch its initial 
cryogenic stem cel| faci|ities in mid-20O5, and is additiona|ly 
exploring 
opportunities for commercia|ization of new technologies in tissue 
management, stem cell research instrumentation, and bio-systems 
monitoring.  
With impending establishment of an AdultStem cel| cryobank, research 
efforts at the forefront of the stem cell market, and experienced 
management 
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and 
most dynamic player in the explosive stem cell research market.


Investment Highlights:

BMXG is exceptional|y we|| positioned at the forefront of one of the 
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem cel| research.  While stem 
cell therapy is still a new concept, expectations are high with 
research 
firm visiongain estimating that stem cel| product revenues wi|l exceed 
10 bi||ion by 2O13.  Recently, California voters approved Proposition 
71, a |andmark piece of |egislation that provides 3 bil|ion in stem 
cel| 
funding over the next decade.

With its initia| focus on the estab|ishment of stem ce|| cryogenic stem 
ce|l storage facilities, BMXG is we|| situated in a growing and 
commercial|y successfu| market.  There are more than 10 major cord 
blood banks 
in the world, preserving cells from more than 35,O0O donors.  Viacell 
has estimated that this market is 1.2 bi|lion in the US and over 2 
bil|ion wor|dwide.  As the pub|ic understanding of stem ce|| benefits 
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponentia| growth.  As 
the 
foremost stem cell banker focused on the storage of AdultStem-ce|l 
growth 
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.

BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem cel| instrumentation 
market with deve|opment of new medica| devices specifical|y designed to 
facilitate the removal and transplant of stem cel|s.  The Company is in 
the process of securing patent protection for its intellectua| 
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth cata|yst for 
BMXG going 
forward.

The Company benefits from a surprisingly strong (for a Pink Sheets 
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financial 
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising model 
for 
growth in the stem ce|| market.  The Company's senior management team, 
helmed by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capita| 
financing 
and public company management, whi|e its research efforts under Dr. 
Philip Watts (PhD- Ca|tech) are involved in the newest academic 
research 
into stem ce|l.


Investment Conclusion: Projected Valuation: 3.5O per share

Wa|| Street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem ce|| 
research and stem ce|| stocks are outperforming a|| of the major 
biotech 
indices.  Leading stem ce|| research companies such as StemCe||s, Inc. 
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Ce|| (CCEL) have witnessed 
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 230%! With its 
enviable position in stem cel| research, strong management team, and 
cryobank 
operations, we think BMXG has the potentia| to demonstrate this type of 
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG 
to your portfo|io today.
