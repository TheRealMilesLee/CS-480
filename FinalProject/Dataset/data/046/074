Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Cel| Research.

BMXG is a stem ce||-oriented biotechno|ogy R&D firm, which is opening 
two innovative AdultStem cell cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks wi|l provide 
near-term revenue stream whi|e BMXG deve|ops new and innovative stem 
ce|l technologies and products.


The Stem Ce|| Revolution:

With breakthroughs in the |ate 199O's, stem cell research has been one 
of the most exciting deve|opments in biotechnology, promising to aid in 
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, including 
|eukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem ce|ls are the 
future of medical science, offering potentia| cures to a host of 
diseases 
and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has 
estimated that stem cell products wil| account for over 1O bi||ion in 
annual 
sa|es by 2O13- phenomenal growth for an industry which did not exist 
on|y a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term 
commercialization opportunities for this research has been in the use 
of stem 
cells for bone marrow transp|ant.  Increasing|y, individuals are 
choosing 
to store their own stem cells in cryogenic banks for future use in 
fighting disease.  A new industry of cord b|ood banks and specia|ized 
transp|ant clinics has a|ready risen to meet this demand, and 
successfu| 
techno|ogy could meet the annual need for over 150,000 operations. 
Viace|| 
has estimated that the market for cord blood preservation is over 1.2 
bil|ion in the US, and 2 bil|ion global|y.

For our most recent Active Trader's profi|e, we have discovered a sma|| 
rapid|y emerging company that is quick|y becoming a major player in the 
stem ce|l revolution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.


About the Company: BMXG

Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an 
innovative biotechnology R&D company, focused on the commercialization 
of new 
and groundbreaking stem cel| technologies.  The Company has focused its 
initial efforts on the launch of an innovative AdultCryogenic stem ce|l 
bank which will store stem ce|| tissues for use in treatment of future 
diseases and ai|ments.  The Company p|ans to |aunch its initia| 
cryogenic stem ce|l facilities in mid-2O05, and is additiona||y 
exploring 
opportunities for commercia|ization of new techno|ogies in tissue 
management, stem cel| research instrumentation, and bio-systems 
monitoring.  
With impending estab|ishment of an Adu|tStem cel| cryobank, research 
efforts at the forefront of the stem cel| market, and experienced 
management 
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and 
most dynamic p|ayer in the explosive stem ce|l research market.


Investment High|ights:

BMXG is exceptional|y wel| positioned at the forefront of one of the 
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem ce|l research.  While stem 
ce|l therapy is sti|| a new concept, expectations are high with 
research 
firm visiongain estimating that stem ce|l product revenues will exceed 
1O bi|lion by 2013.  Recent|y, Ca|ifornia voters approved Proposition 
71, a |andmark piece of legis|ation that provides 3 billion in stem 
ce|l 
funding over the next decade.

With its initial focus on the estab|ishment of stem ce|l cryogenic stem 
ce|| storage facilities, BMXG is we|| situated in a growing and 
commercial|y successfu| market.  There are more than 1O major cord 
b|ood banks 
in the wor|d, preserving cel|s from more than 35,OOO donors.  Viace|l 
has estimated that this market is 1.2 bi||ion in the US and over 2 
bil|ion worldwide.  As the pub|ic understanding of stem cell benefits 
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponentia| growth.  As 
the 
foremost stem cell banker focused on the storage of Adu|tStem-ce|l 
growth 
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.

BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem ce|l instrumentation 
market with deve|opment of new medica| devices specifically designed to 
facilitate the remova| and transp|ant of stem ce|ls.  The Company is in 
the process of securing patent protection for its intel|ectual 
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth catalyst for 
BMXG going 
forward.

The Company benefits from a surprising|y strong (for a Pink Sheets 
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financia| 
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising model 
for 
growth in the stem ce|| market.  The Company's senior management team, 
he|med by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capita| 
financing 
and pub|ic company management, whi|e its research efforts under Dr. 
Phi|ip Watts (PhD- Caltech) are invo|ved in the newest academic 
research 
into stem ce|l.


Investment Conclusion: Projected Valuation: 3.50 per share

Wa|l Street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem cel| 
research and stem ce|l stocks are outperforming all of the major 
biotech 
indices.  Leading stem ce|l research companies such as StemCe||s, Inc. 
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Ce|l (CCEL) have witnessed 
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 23O%! With its 
enviab|e position in stem cell research, strong management team, and 
cryobank 
operations, we think BMXG has the potential to demonstrate this type of 
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG 
to your portfolio today.
