Dear Sir=2FMadam=2C 

I am contacting you on a transfer of a huge sum=2E
of money from a deseased=2E Though I know that a 
transaction of this magnitude will make any one
apprehensive and worried=2C but I am assuring you
that all will be well at the end of the day=2E 
Introduction=3A 
My name is Mr=2E Keykhosrow Sobhe and l am the Solicitor to Mr=2E Robert who died on a plane crash with his entire family on the 11th of September 2001 along side other passengers in flight 175=2E from Boston=2C Massachusetts to Los Angeles California=2C it was the second hijacked plane to strike the World=2E Trade Center plugging into the South Tower=2E Two pilots and seven flight attendants and fifty-seven=2857=29 passengers were on board=2E 
Since Mr=2E Roberts death=2C there has not been any application to claim his money by a next-of-kin as his wife who was supposed to be his next-of-kin died along side with my late client in the same accident=2E After 4 years of dormancy any such accounts holding funds of certain magnitudes will be re-directed to the bank treasury as unclaimed funds 
and will be shared among the bank share holders=2E After which the file will 
be closed=2E This is what I am trying to prevent from happening=2E I will rather see the whole money go directly to charity organization with a help of a foreigner=2E 
If you share the same ideology as myself=2C please do not hesitate to contact me=2E
However=2C it may interest you to know that we have secured from probate 
and order of mandamus to locate any of the diseased surviving next-of-kin=2E
upon this discovery=2E I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next-of-kin to the deceased=2E 
All documentation will be carefully worked out by me for the funds to be released into your favor as the beneficiary's next-of-kin=2E 

NOTE=3A THE REASON WHY I AM DOING THIS IS THAT=2C
I WOULD RATHER SEE THE WHOLE AMOUNT GO DIRECTLY TO CHARITY=2C THAN HAVE THOSE BANK DIRECTORS AND SHARE HOLDERS HAVE IT IN THEIR PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNTS=2E 
IT IS ALSO A LIFE TIME OPPORTUNITY FOR ME AND HOPEFULLY YOU AS WELL=2E
Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information bellow=2E 
1=2E YOUR FULL NAME=2FADDRESS=3B 
2=2E YOUR COMPANY NAME=3B
3=2E DIRECT TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER=3B
I await your urgent response via this email box=3A keykhosrow=5Fs=5F=40lawyersmail=2Ecom =3Cmailto=3Akeykhosrow=5Fs=5F=40lawyersmail=2Ecom=3E 
Regards=2C 
Keykhosrow Sobhe
