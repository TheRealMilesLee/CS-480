Dear Sheila,

I left you a voice mail this afternoon with regards to establishing an execution and clearing relationship for exchange traded futures and options. At the request of Shane Dallman and Aaron Armstrong in London, I have quoted rates for all relevant exchange traded products. They have expressed an interest in using Deutsche Bank for their futures trading so that we are arranging to have documentation drafted and sent to Houston as soon as possible.

I have asked one of my colleagues, Rob Manders, to contact you to establish the names of the legal entities that should be on the contracts, and the name and address of the person/people to whom all documentation should be sent. Rob will be coordinating all the documentation and will assure that your operations department is happy with the service that Deutsche Bank will offer. To that end, he has organised a video conference with Kimberley Hopley in London and Jason Fisher in Houston for the week of 8th October.

I hope that these arrangements meet with your approval. Should you have any questions, please feel free to call me on 44 207 547 3486. Equally, you can reach Rob Manders on 44 207 545 2005.

Best Regards,

Kelly McKenney
