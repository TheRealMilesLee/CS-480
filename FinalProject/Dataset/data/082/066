Dear Shelley, 

What an exciting story!  I am sure that you are anxiously awaiting being reunited with Alina.  I know that the bureaucracy for an international adoption can be quite extensive.  We had some good friends who adopted a little girl from an orphanage here in Almaty and they worked really hard to be able to do so.  I hope that the procedure will come to a closure soon so that you can come to bring her home with you!   

I was, indeed, able to travel back to Kazakhstan last month without any significant problems.  I was on the first BA flight Houston-London after the attacks, so the lines were huge, but there was no problem with the flights themselves or with security.  It just took more airport time.   

In Kazakhstan, the situation is currently peaceful.  The government here seems concerned with protecting its borders and American interests.  We are in contact with the American embassy here, and have made contingency plans in case the situation deteriorates, but we feel fine about remaining here at this time.   

Please let me know if you have any specific questions. 

Sincerely, 

Catherine
