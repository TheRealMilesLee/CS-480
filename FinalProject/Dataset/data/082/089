Dear Mr. Whalley,

Gartner Group says that over 50% of CRM installations fail "from a
customer's point of view."  Yankee says that 77% of companies who implement
CRM applications find they do not "receive a distinct return on investment."

You know what you want:  tangible business benefits.  What has your return
on investment been from your CRM implementation?  10%?  20%?  More?  Is
there room for improvement in your organization's ability to implement
decisions?

Elity InSight(tm) is a cooperative, event-processing software catalyst that
helps Siebel customers detect important customer behavior patterns as they
happen, so you can turn that data into timely, appropriate, profitable
actions.

See how major Siebel customers improve their responsiveness and quickly
improve ROI using Elity InSight:
