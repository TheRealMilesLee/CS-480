Mary, 
We are currently in the process of doing diversity analysis with the Mid-Year 2001 PRC data.  We will also have the Jeanerette group run the standard deviations.  Since I have taken on the EEO/AAP responsibility, Michelle and I agree that the HR data needs to be incorporated into the analysis and will need your approval for me to get access to the information.   Please let me know what I need to do to get clearance.  Our target is to get the information ready by Thursday but will need at least a day to consolidate the information.    

Thanks. ay
