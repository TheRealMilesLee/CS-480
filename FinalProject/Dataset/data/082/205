Vince, I hope this e-mail finds you well.

The recent award of the Nobel Prize in Economics to Stiglitz, Spence and Akerlof  has set me thinking. Lots of what Enron does addresses asymmetrical markets by improving information. Is it a stretch to apply their theories to energy? Do our risk management tools help equalize the amount of information in the marketplace?

For example, Stiglitz says that insurance deductibles is the way that insurance carriers get customers to reveal their potential liability. Someone who is more likely to be in poor health or have accidents will seek lower deductibles. Do any of Enron's products help us, or the energy markets, reveal information that creates not only a more effective market but a market that works? 

If there is something substantial to this, I'd like to write about the subject for Exchange, the wholesale customer magazine. If it is just an interesting observation (that's true), perhaps we'd run it in eBiz.

Please take care,
Jeannie
