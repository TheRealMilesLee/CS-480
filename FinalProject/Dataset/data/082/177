1. We had 55 students sign in and had 12 Enron employees show up (number includes Rod).  
2. We experienced technical difficulty with the slide show but managed to work through it (some of the animated pictures and graphs did not appear).
3. Almost half of the students are MBAs interested in the Associate program.
4. Most of the students used the Career Service Center this year as opposed to last year where we received a limited # of resumes from the CSC (less than 20 I believe).

Sometime today or tomorrow, I'll send the sign-in sheets, resumes and left over material to you.  I'm very busy today as I spent most of my time yesterday preparing for the event.  Please let Rod and I know if and when there will be a resume reviewing party.  I'll send an email out to the UH recruiting team to help.
