I spoke to Katy last night and she mentioned that each of us had expressed interest in going to visit her in Dallas. Right now Southwest has flights to Dallas for $60. Would the 2 of you be interested in taking a trip up there either the weekend of Nov. 3 or Nov. 10?

Let me know because I am going to purchase a ticket for one of those weekends.
