Dear Valued Customer,

The Enron Creative Center is initiating a comprehensive survey of its
customers' satisfaction, and would very much like to include your feedback.
Bowne Business Solutions is proud to be the onsite provider of Enron's
graphic services.  I would like to invite you to take a moment to complete
a brief survey about the BBS services at Enron.  In order to protect your
privacy, BBS has engaged the services of independent market research firm
Optimal Edge to manage the project. Your individual identity is guaranteed
to be 100% protected, as all responses are accepted anonymously on a secure
Web server, where the survey is hosted by CustomerSat, Inc.  We sincerely
hope you will take a few minutes to participate, as your feedback and
comments will help BBS better understand your needs.

To go to the survey customized for Enron simply click on the following
address:

or copy the URL and paste it into your Web browser.  If you need

Your opinions and satisfaction are very important to us. Thank you very
much for your feedback!


Sincerely,

John Zilker
Client Services Manager
