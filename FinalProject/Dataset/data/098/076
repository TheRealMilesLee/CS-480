Tracy,

Thank you!  These meetings are very helpful in better understanding the business.  I'm currently scheduled to be in Korea, but may change plans and will let you know.  

By the way, Rod had suggested that I hold off on bothering you about my group's budget until after you complete this enormous endeavor.  However, FYI, I had submitted an approximately $2 million budget through Steve Kean's group and about $300,000 was submitted for Gina Taylor's group in the ETS budget.  I'm probably going to identify some reductions in these numbers.  Please let me know when you need details.

Thanks,

John
