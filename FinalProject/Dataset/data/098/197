you are the first to reply. So I will let you know about the consensus on
the ad thing.  

We will probably be up around 615 on Saturday.  I don't plan on fixing
myself up for the event.  Probably just throw on some shorts and a hat.  

So if you can't make it Friday, then let me know what time you were thinking
on Saturday.  No big deal, just wanted to mention that we would be home on
friday evening for those who wanted to bring the stuff over that night.

So what all do you have for the sale??

I have a coffee table, end table, typewriter, stereo speakers and then some
other misc stuff.

Jen

Hello All!

Just wanted to give you guys an update.  The weather looks good for the
garage sale this weekend.  So that is a good thing.  

If you want to bring your stuff by Friday evening, that might be a good
plan
for us all to get things set up.  That way all we have to do saturday
morning is drag the tables out of the garage.  Also, I do not have a
rack
for hanging clothes, so they will have to be folded or hung on the
fence.

How about coming over friday evening around 630-7pm.  Also, if you have
any
card tables, please bring them.  I have one and am borrowing two from my
parents.  But I am sure we may need a couple of more.

I bought a couple of garage sale signs on Monday and plan to put them
out on
the main street, South Braeswood.  Another idea would be for us to take
out
an ad in the greensheet.  Someone told me they cost around $15.  I am in
the
process of getting some info as to the exact cost and will let you know
when
i get the info confirmed. I am leaving that up to the majority vote as
to
whether we all chip in for the add or not.  I think it may be worth it,
some
people look for those adds and spend all day saturday doing garage
sales.
But whatever you guys think

The hours of the Sale will be from 7am-1230ish.  I think by then
whatever
doesn't sale either goes home or to goodwill.  I know some of you cant
be
there all day or right at 7am, but I will need some help so let me know
what
time you plan on coming over that morning.

Ok, so to summarize all my chatter, 3 questions, 1:  do we take out an
ad in
the greensheet?   2: are you coming over friday to set up? and 3:  what
time
will you be there on sat?

See ya

Jennifer
