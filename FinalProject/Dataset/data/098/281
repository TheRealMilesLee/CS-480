Anil - Please disregard

Francisco -  I was trying to send this to you as well as Mary as I am not sure which of you will be working on it.

Sorry
Wendy

Mary/Francisco,

Please find attached the credit worksheet for G6 Energy Retailing, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Enersource Corporation.  Enersource Corporation will be the guarantor under this contract.  New guarantees need to be exchanged.  Please call with questions or comments.


 

Paul - Please be advised that the proposed terms are for discussion and negotiation purposes only as I am still waiting to here back from the counterparty on a few issued.  

Thanks
Wendy
