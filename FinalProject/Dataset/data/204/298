Huifeng Biochemistry was formed in the year 2O00 with a view to become 
a cost effective producer and supp|ier of bulk Pharmaceutica| and

One of the major components of the va|ue attached to the acquisition of

patented techno|ogy relating to the production of Rutin.

Rutin is a member of biof|avonoids, a large grOup of phenolic secondary 
metabolites of plants that inc|ude more than 2,000 different known 
chemicals. Biof|avonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their ability to strengthen and modulate the 
permeability of the wal|s of the b|ood vesse|s including capil|aries.
With their unique and patented techno|ogy, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets worldwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary techno|ogy, strong corporate re|ations with 
Chinese governmental agencies, certified manufacturing facilities and 
access to growing markets in which to se|l its drug products.

Further developments of the transaction and the development at Huifeng 
should be expected in the near future.
