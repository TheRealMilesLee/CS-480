Well I can find no mention on any of my hoax resources.  It very well may be true.
 
Sad if it is.

Wonder if this is true, or just another internet fiction?
 
 
 
 
 
 
EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS INFO AND TAKE STEPS TO SHOW DISGUST WITH THE ABSENSE OF THOUGHTFULNESS. MIKE 

FYI 

CNN Headline News did a short news listing regarding Ford and GM's 
(and other major carmakers) contributions to the relief and recovery 
efforts in New York and Washington. The findings are as follows...... 

1. Ford- $1 million to American Red Cross matching employee contributions 
of the same number plus 10 Excursions to NY Fire Dept. The company also 
offered ER response team services and office space to displaced 
government employees. 

2. GM- $1 million to American Red Cross matching employee contributions 
of the same number and a fleet of vans, suv's, and trucks. 

3. Daimler Chrysler- $10 million to support of the children and victims of 
the Sept. 11 attack. 

4. Harley Davidson motorcycles- $1 million and 30 new motorcycles to the 
New York Police Dept. 

5. Volkswagen- Employees and management created a Sept 11 Foundation, 
funded initial with $2 million, for the assistance of the children and 
victims of the WTC. 

6. Hyundai- $300,000 to the American Red Cross. 

7. Audi- Nothing. 

8. BMW- Nothing. 

9. Daewoo- Nothing. 

10. Fiat- Nothing. 

11. Honda- Nothing despite boasting of second best sales month ever in 
August 2001 

12. Isuzu- Nothing. 

13. Mitsubishi- Nothing. 

14. Nissan- Nothing. 

15. Porsche- Nothing. Press release with condolences via the Porsche 
website. 

16. Subaru- Nothing. 

17. Suzuki- Nothing. 

18. Toyota- Nothing despite claims of high sales in July and August 2001. 
Condolences posted on the website 

Whenever the time may be for you to purchase or lease a new vehicle, keep 
this information in mind. You might want to give more consideration to a 
car manufactured by an American-owned and / or American based company. 
Apart from Hyundai and Vo! lkswagen, the foreign car companies contributed 
nothing at all to the citizens of the United States. It's OK for these 
companies 
to take money out of this country, but it is apparently not acceptable to 
return 
some in a time of crisis. I believe we should not forget things like this. 
Say 
thank you in a way that gets their attention. 

Pass it on.
