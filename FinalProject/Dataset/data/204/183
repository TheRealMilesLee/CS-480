SNOOZE YOU LOSE FARES: MORE UPDATES 3 TIMES A DAY 

Over the past 60 days, we have introduced our very popular Quickfare Finder that handles over 200,000 requests per day. We also introduced City Low Fare Search that ranks the fares from your city from the lowest to the highest. Now we have introduced Snooze You Lose Fares. This feature is updated three times a day and only ranks the airfares from your departing airport that we believe are great buys. Many times, you will find an airfare by the major airlines that is under four cents a mile. For example, today, we had Phoenix to Buffalo for $105 roundtrip. That's only two-and-a-half cents per mile. How about Cincinnati to San Francisco for $142 roundtrip (three-and-a-half cents per mile); Chicago to New York City for $121 roundtrip (three cents a mile) or Dallas to Raleigh for $70 roundtrip (three cents a mile)?
