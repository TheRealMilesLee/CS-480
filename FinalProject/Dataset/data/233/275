MR.JOSEPH YUN
CHINA MERCHANT BANK.
DES BOUEX RD. BRANCH,
CENTRAL HONG KONG,
HONK KONG.
j_yun46@yahoo.com.hk

Dear friend,

I am Mr.Joseph Yun, credit officer of the China Merchant Bank. I have a 
concealed business suggestion for you.
 
Before the U.S and Iraqi war, our client Gen.Talfik Kubu who was with 
the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed 

deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Forty Three Million, 
Six Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.Upon maturity 
several notices was sent to him, even during the war. 

 Again after the war another notification was sent and still no 
response came from him. We later find out that the General and his 
family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.
 
After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen.Talfik Kubu 
did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the 
paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last 

time he was at my office that no One except me knew of his deposit in 
my bank.So, Forty Three Million,Six Hundred Thousand United State 
Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim 
it.What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my 
country at the expiration three years the funds will revert to the 
ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.
 
Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as 
a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen.Talfik Kubu so that you 
will be able to receive his funds.
 
WHAT IS TO BE DONE:
 
I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we 
shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare 
the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to 
Gen.Talfik Kubu ,all that is required from you at this stage is for you to 
provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can 
commence his job.
 
After you have been made the next of kin,the attorney will also file in 
for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter 
of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account 

that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the 
matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will 
prepare all the necessary documents.Please endeavor to observe utmost 
discretion in all matters concerning this issue.
 
Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we 
shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5%for any 
expenses incurred during the course of this operation.

Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax 
numbers for easy communication,and i will provide you with more details of 
this operation.
 
Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.
 
Kind Regards,
 
Mr.Joseph Yun
