Can you help us with determining a location code for the 20" Gomez Lateral on TW's books? Would these facilities be included in one of the locations listed below? By description and quantity we are unable to confirm.

Kevin is attempting to meet with cusotmers tomorrow.

Thanks for you help.

FYI.

As I indicated in my phone message we are not finding these assets using the description provided. Judy Beck is or was the facilitiy
person for ETS. She is now Dynegy, therefore, we may get a referral instead of an answer.

Judy,

I need to provide a NBV for a Gomez Laterial (35miles of 20" pipe), to Kevin Hyatt. Frank says it should be in company 0060 (TW).
I ran the following locations numbers: 44*094, 44*095, 44*149 44*34037, but found nothing in co. 0060.  Can you help?

Thanks,

Mary
