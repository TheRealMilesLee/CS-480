My Dear,

I write to seek your services in a private confidential matter
regarding to late Mr. Adam A Williams who died leaving
some funds unclaimed in our bank without any beneficiary. I am
aware that you might not be related to him but I want you to
stand as the beneficiary and I will fill you in, since I have
all the details for the transfer proper. This requires a private
arrangement. Could you perhaps be able to receive these funds
under legal claims then I will fill you in I am willing to give you
30% at the conclusion of this business.

I will need you in legal capacity to stand as his beneficiary.
I have all the details and will fill you in if you are really
willing. Your major role would be either provide me with an
Existing account or to open a bank account where the funds
will be transferred.
All correspondences will be via email for now. The funds in
question are quite large ($32M USD). I will expect a
straight answer from you. YES or NO. If yes, then let's work
out the modalities and a brief profile of your person is
expected.
Contact me immediately for details of the business.

Regard,s
Vincent Oronto.
