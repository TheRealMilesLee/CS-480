FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION:

I am Engr.Edawrd Mazwayi,a Native of Cape Town in South
Africa working with the South Africa Department of Mining &
Energy.

First and foremost I apologise for using this medium to
reach you for a transaction of this magnitude but this is
due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this
medium.

Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export
Promotion Council (SEPC) who was part of my government
delegation to your country during a recent Trade Exhibition
gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me while
assuring me on your competence to handle a business
transaction involving a large sum of money with absolute
confidentiality.

Therefore I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation
with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder
for the benefit of all parties and while hoping you will
keep it as top secret because of the nature of this
transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Energy where I work as a
Director and with the cooperation of three other top
officials,we have in our possession an overdue contract
payment bills totalling Sixteen  Million,four Hundred
Thousand united states dollars(16,400,000.00).This money
which we intend to process its transfer as a form of
contract payment into a reliable
company/individual account depending on your convenience.

Your assistance and co-operation is required due to the
circumstances surrounding our work as government officials
whereby the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does
not allow us to operate a foriegn Bank account hence your
importance in the whole transaction.

Presently, this amount (16.4M) representing the balance of
the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department
by a foreign contracting firm which we the officials
over-invoiced deliberately is lying unclaimed in the
government escrow bank account with Reserve Bank of South
Africa.We hereby seek your assistance and co-operation that
will enable us to process this
sum of money to you as a form of contract payment.

We have the necessary authority to validate and forward
approvals of outstanding contract claims to the government
for final payment on approval through the Reserve Bank of
South Africa (RSBA).

All partners agreed while mandating me to propose that
should you be willing to assist us in the transaction,your
share of the sum will be 25% of the 16.4 million,70% will be
for us and 5% for any expenses incurred in the course of
this project including telephone and fax bills.

The business itself is 100% safe on your part provided you
treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality.Also note
that your area of specialisation is not an hindrance to the
successful execution of this transaction.

I have reposed my confidence in you while awaiting your
prompt response through the private email address above to
notify me of your capability to assist us in achieving
success in this transaction.

Finally on your part,we will appreciate you treat this
transaction as a very confidential one while we assure you
of a 100% safe and full proof free transaction provided you
follow our instructions totally.

I await your confirmation of my message while praying that
this will be the begining of a lifelong partnership between
us.

Thank you for your co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

Engr.Edawrd Mazwayi
