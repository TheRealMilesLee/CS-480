Attention:Sir/Madam 

I am Dr.Chinedu Ego,Branch Manager with United Bank For Africa,ILupeju 
Branch, Lagos, Nigeria.I have an urgent and very profitable business 
proposition for you that should be handled with extreme 
confidentiality. 

On January 6,1998 a Foreign Consultant and contractor with the Nigerian 
Railway Corporation Mr. Abbas Raymond by name made a numbered time 
Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$15.6M (Fifteen 
Million, Six Hundred United States Dollars Only) in my branch. 
Upon maturity I sent a routine notification in accordance with the Bank 
policy to his forwarding address but got no reply.
After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his 
contract employers Nigerian Railway Corporation that Mr. Abbas Raymond 
died from an automobile accident. 

On further investigation, we found out that he died without making a 
Will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I 
therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Abbas 
Raymond did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his 
official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. 
This sum of US$15.6M has been carefully moved out of my bank to a 
Financial and Security Company in Europe for safekeeping.
No one will ever come forward to claim it and according to the Law of 
my country, at the expiration of 7 years the money will revert to the 
ownership of the State (Government) if nobody applies to claim the 
fund.This prompted i to contact you. We want to frontyou as the next of 
kin of our late client thereby making you the legal beneficiary of the 
sum of $15.6 million U.S Dollars that is presently in a Financial and 
Security Company in Europe.I contacted you because it is against our 
code ofethics to own and operate foreign accounts and yourassistance 
would be needed to claim the money in the Financial and Security 
Company in Europe.
I have unanimously agreed that 25% of the entire sumwould be for you if 
you agree to take part in thisprofitable transaction,65% for me while 
the remaining 10% would be used to pay back the expenses that may be 
incurred during the course of the transaction by both parties after the 
fund has been claimed and lodged in your account. In the event that you 
are genunely interested in the transaction, the following information 
would be needed from you to expedite action.
1) Your Full Name .
2) Your Residential or Company Address.
3) Your Private Mobile,Telphone and Fax numbers
where you can be reached at all time because this transaction entails
constant communication.
The transaction is 100% legal and totally free ofrisks as all 
modalities has been perfected to ensurethe hitch free succesof the 
transaction.If you are interested, send the requested information via 
my private email box(drchineduego@yahoo.co.in ) as soon as possible so 
that we can proceedand after sending it urgently.
