Louise,

We tried to find a way around the $250,000 portalbuilder charge for content which I emailed you about before. 

Looks like there isn't a way - and in fact, the total charge will be closer to $1,000,000, including all of the components needed for content.

So, the official question is: Do you want us to spend this much to preserve the ability to carry EnronOnline content, or do we revise the Quotes page to exclude content?

I am personally having a hard time finding value for money in this expense - but you mentioned before that UBS were keen to preserve existing functionality.

Dave
