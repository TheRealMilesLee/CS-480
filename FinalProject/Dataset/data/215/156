Sounds good, but TW has a weekly gas control meeting every Friday at 3:00.  Can your meeting be finished by 3:00, or should we start earlier?

There is a great concern from TW Planning/ Marketing that the existing CAS system is not responding to our expectations.
While we have corrected numerous bugs in the program, getting the solutions to the production side has been somewhat slow. 
This has caused a delay from Facility Planning to the Marketing group. Lets plan to talk about some new features that Marketing
 has requested for the CAS system. Pipeline Facility Planning is arranging a meeting on Friday Feb-1 From 2 to 3:30 pm in 
Room # 3907 to discuss the concerned issues.
