Barry,
No, I didn't receive this before. Regarding the plan for us to build credit
by selling day gas, yes, a bit more detail on the mechanics would help. Any
trading with Enron would have to be approved by my management. Regarding El
Paso, Gas Procurement needs to see what the utility's plan of reorganization
is before we can look at that seriously. The plan is due Dec 6 at the
latest. I have a call in to Eric LeDain regarding the Canadian contract, so
we should be getting to that soon.
Ray
