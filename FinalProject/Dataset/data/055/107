Attached are Redline copies of AEP's comments and proposed changes to our EOL Amendment.  They have broken our original amendment into two amendments.  The first Redline copy is for Financial and Physical Gas.  The second Redline copy is for Financial and Physical Power.  Please review and let me know where I can be of any assistance as well as how you are going to proceed with providing them feedback.
