Eric,

Thanks for the note, I do appreciate it.   Every thing is pretty hectic 
here, rumors flyin a mile a minute, but just like everything else in the 
military rumors are just rumors until they actually happen, nothin is ever 
set in stone. You will probably know before I do when and if any forces 
deploy unless they are actually successful at the news blackout they are 
requesting for this one.  We'll see.
Hope you and all your friends came through this okay.

I look forward to one day gettin back there to catch a UT game with ya,

Stay in touch wildman.

Brett.
