<DIV><FONT face=Arial color=#eaeaea size=2>When viewed straight on, the Motorola 
  Razr V3 looks no different from many flip phones. In fact, with its brushed-silver 
  coloring and rectangular shape, it almost leaves you wondering exactly what 
  the big deal is. Turn the handset on its side, however, and the wow factor begins. 
  Measuring 3.8 by 2.0 . by 0.5 inches and weighing 3.3 ounces, the 
  Razr V3 is so pocket-friendly and portable that it's smaller than many wallets. 
  It also feels light--almost too light--in the hand, and its distinctive styling 
  is sure to win looks  Before a man can stand he must learn to kneel.   on the street and in the boardroom. Fortunately, 
  Motorola did not compromise a solid construction for the cutting-edge design, 
  and the burly hinge ensures the phone snaps open and shut with authority. We 
  couldn't help noticing the V3 is wider and bit taller than many flip phones, 
  but its paper-thin profile more than makes up for it.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#eaeaea></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial color=#eaeaea size=2>Wide load: The Razr V3 isn't small 
  in all ways.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#eaeaea></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial color=#eaeaea size=2>A postage-stamp-size external display 
  supports 4,000 colors and shows the time, battery life, signal strength, and 
  caller ID (where available). Though it can be viewed in most lighting situations, 
  it goes completely dark when the backlighting--which cannot be changed--turns 
  off. Above the screen and well out of the way of fingers is the VGA camera lens. 
  You don't  The shortest books: get a flash or a self-portrait mirror, but the external 
  screen acts as a viewfinder when the flip is closed. Controls on the outside 
  of the phone are few. A voice-recorder button sits on the right side of the 
  front flap, while a volume rocker and a dedicated camera key sit on the left; 
  when the phone is open, Be at peace with yourself first and then you will be able to bring peace to others. (Thomas A. Kempis)   the camera button acts as a third soft 
  key. As they are on the side of the phone, the buttons are rather thin, but 
  we had no trouble finding them by feel. One is as though nothing is a miracle.  There is nothing so easy but that it becomes difficult when you do it with reluctance.    A candidate is someone who gets money from the rich and votes from the poor to protect them from each other.   
   Quotations are sometimes valuable pearls, but original thoughts can be priceless treasure.   Copy from two its research.    Never confuse having a career with having a life.    Skier; one who pays an arm and a leg for the opportunity to break them.    Statistics is like a Bikini; what is revealed is suggestive, but what is concealed is vital.    Too many Christians are no longer fishers of men but keepers of the aquarium.   
   To get profit without risk, experience without danger, and reward without work is as impossible as it is to live without being born. (A.P. Gouthey)    Treat people like angels; you will meet some and help make some.    A fine is a tax for doing wrong.  A customer in a bakery was observed carefully examining all the rich-looking pastries displayed on trays in the glass cases. When a clerk approached him and asked, "What would you like?" he answered, "I'd like that chocolate-covered, cream-filled doughnut, that jelly-filled doughnut and that cheese Danish."  A clean tie attracts the soup of the day.   </FONT></DIV>
