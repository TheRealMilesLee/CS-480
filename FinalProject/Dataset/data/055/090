				Re: Potential Participants in the 2002
Annual FTR Auction:

				The ISO is actively involved in preparing
for the next auction of Firm Transmission Rights (FTRs) set for mid-to-late
January 2002.  The upcoming auction will be very similar to the auction held
last year.  The FTRs to be auctioned will be in effect from April 1st, 2002
through March 31st, 2003.

				If you are interested in participating in
this year's auction, please send an e-mail stating your interest to Jim
McClain by COB Monday October 15, 2001.  Jim's e-mail is jmcclain@caiso.com
and his phone number is (916) 608-7072.  Please provide your company's exact
name and acronym, e-mail address, physical address, phone number and the
person to whom we should send the required auction information.  Entities
notifying the ISO of their interest in the 2002 FTR Auction will be added to
a more focused distribution list.  After gathering responses from all
interested parties the ISO will only send FTR-related information to this
specific distribution list.    

				The ISO is evaluating the training
requirements and schedules for potential auction participants along with
other information related to the 2002 auction.  We will post this
information on the FTR Auction site at
(http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/ftr/) and distribute it directly to the
potential FTR Auction Participants.  This site will be different from last
year's site to avoid confusion between the previous and next auction.

				Thank you for your assistance.
