Dear beloved brethern,

I am Ms. KIMAEVA LIOUDMILA, a personal secretary to Mikhail Khodorkovsky
the richest man in Russia and owner of the following companies: 
Chairman CEO: YUKOS OIL (Russian Largest Oil Company) 
Chairman CEO: Menatep SBP Bank (A well reputable financial Institution)
with its branches all over the world). 
I seek your partnership to accommodate the sum of US$4.2M for us.
My Boss got arrested for his involvement in politics in financing the
Leading and opposing political party (the Union of Right Forces, led by
Boris Nemtsov and Yabloko, a liberal/social democratic party led by Gregor
Yavlinsky)which posed treat to President Vladimir Putin's second tenure as
Russian president before he was re-elected On March 14, 2004. You can catch
more of the story on  this website:-

http://newsfromrussia.com/main/2003/11/13/51215.html

The fund (US$48.5M) forty eight millions in question was approved by the
Government of Russia for payment of various YUKOS OIL contractors/suppliers
to prevent them from loosing the money they invested in the numerous
contracts they executed for the above firm. The Government had already
concluded plans to freeze all the accounts in my boss name (Mikhail
Khodorkovsky) both corporate and personal before I connived with the
Accountant General of YUKOS OIL (who is also my partner in this
transaction) to raise a memo stating that YUKOS OIL owe contractors the
above amount which was finally approved for payment after some
deliberations.
Actually, we have paid all our contractors both local and foreign because
they agitated for their payment when they had that my boss was arrested.

YOUR ROLE:I will present you/your company as one of the contractors we are
owing so that you can stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum or
part of the fund according to your
financial strength or the strength of your company. I will arrange for the
documentation which the payee bank will need to transfer the sum to you. I
have decided to use this sum to relocate to American continent and never to
be connected to any of Mikhail Khodorkovsky conglomerates. The transaction
has to be concluded as soon as possible. 
You will be rewarded with reasonable percentage(%) of the total sum for
your partnership. 
Can you be our partner on this transaction?
As soon as I get your willingness to assist us in this deal, I will give
you more details. I can be reached by email:- ( kimaevayuko@netscape.net ) 
 for security reason to avoid and avert any suspision.

Thank you very much

Yours faithfully,
Mrs. Kimaeva Lioudmila
