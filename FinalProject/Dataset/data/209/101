Any thing that is not terminated per legal.

I am sure they will want them split between in the money and out of the money.

So think about how we get there.

let me know

Hey guys,

Each book should have been split into 3 books - 

- terminated by the counterparty
- ongoing transactions (active) and
- transactions that have not yet been terminated by a counterparty but that we are not going to fullfil.

The DPR should only have the active transactions in it. Hope that clarifies!
