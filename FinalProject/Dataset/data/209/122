Hi Kam,

I have already applied there online last week but I am afraid that it may have gone into that great HR black hole. Thank you for the heads up, though.  Do you have any contacts there?  Scott Neal has been trying to get a hold of me.  UBS is looking for some weather guys because a bunch of weather people left there.  Now wouldn't that be funny if I ended up back there in a different capacity?
