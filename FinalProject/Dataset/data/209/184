The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control....

Jan 28	
Beginning at 6:00 p.m., the Telephony team will remove the telephone switch from 3AC and migrate phone numbers.  The maintenance is expected to last approximately one hour.  Each block of numbers will experience an outage of a few minutes during which calls made to an affected number will not go through and will not roll to voice mail.  The numbers affected are: 345-5000...6999; 713-646-6000...6599; 713-646-7000...7999; 713-646-8200...8399; 713-646-8600..8699; 713-646-9700...9799; 713-345-0200...2999.  The number 713-345-7000 to access voice mail will not be affected by this maintenance.  However, any number within these maintenance groups will be affected regardless of whether it was moved from 3AC.  This change will impact ETS users.
