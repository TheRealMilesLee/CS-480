Laura:

I'm not sure you were responding to my own message of earlier today.

We had no break-in--it was a small kitchen fire from an unwatched pot.

If someone on the street is breaking into back sheds, it's probably kids or
itinerants.  Actually, I've found that a resident dog and an alarm system seem
to discourage most would-be break-in's.
