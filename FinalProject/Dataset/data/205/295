Thanks Kevin,
 I appreciate you ordering for me, just let me know when you bring the FFL form. I may be going to California this coming weekend, My Son and Daughter in law are having his first child today and I want to go see my first natural grand child ASAP. So let me know if I need to do anything before the end of the week.

Thanks: John

Your order should be here by Tuesday, 1/29 if not sooner.  I'll bring in the FFL form for you to fill out.
