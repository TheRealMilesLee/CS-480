Subject=3A   Mr=2EJONES MAGORO 

 
Dearest=3A Friend=2C

My Name is Mr=2EJONES MAGO a credit officer with the one of the leading =28Finance Trust House=29 here in
Cotonou Republic Du Benin=2E In my department i discovered an abandoned funds =28USD 12 M=29 in an account
that belongs to one of our foreign customer =28MR=2EANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich=2C Germany=29 who died along
with his entire family in July 2000 in a plane crash=2Ehttp=3A=2F=2Fnews=2Ebbc=2Eco=2Euk=2F1=2Fhi=2Fworld=2Feurope=2F859479=2Estm
Since i got information about his death=2C I have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his
money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the
deceased as indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his
supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the
claim=2E It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and
release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent
disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as
unclaimed bill=2E

The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after Six years=2C the
money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund=2E The request of foreigner as next of
kin in this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and an Indigenecannot
stand as next of kin to a foreigner=2E

Your percentage will be declare to you as soon as you indicate your interest=2EI will visit your country for
disbursement according to the percentage indicated
 THANKS 
MR=2EJONES MAGO=2C
