        <TD valign="top"> <P align=left>VIVI has been in a very tight trading 
            range, also called a channel, of between $.165 to $.21 for the past 
            3 months. Each time the stock has hit the support level of $.165 there 
            has been a major move to the upside on above average volume. We have 
            to assume that technical traders see the support and jump in for a 
            quick profit. From a technical perspective VIVI is ready for a breakout 
            to the upside, we see nominal resistance at $.25 but if we break through 
            that level look for VIVI to move into the $.30’s, which would be almost 
            a 100% move. But we don’t just like VIVI from a technical point of 
            view.<img src="http://www.politicalstump.org/newsletters/issues/vivi/070705/image_02.gif" width=461

            They have been operational now for over a month and from all the PR’s 
            it appears the flight service is a huge success. Now that they are 
            operational they have started to turn their attention to promoting 
            the stock and the actual company. <br>
            <br>
            They announced earlier today an aggressive investor awareness road 
            show set to commence Monday July 11th. We can surmise that the Company 
            would not go on an investor awareness campaign without a full portfolio 
            of good news. So let’s see how this plays out over the next couple 
            of weeks but we firmly believe that VIVI is a great buy at these levels.<BR>

        <TD valign="top">Miami, Florida --- (BUSINESS WIRE) --- July 7th, 2005 
          --- Viva International, Inc. (OTCBB:VIVI) announced today the official 
          “kick-off” of its new media marketing program by hosting a promotional 
          party in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic for tour operators and travel 
          agents.<BR>

          Viva’s subsidiary, Eastern Caribbean Air (EC Air) hosted an introduction 
          party for the tours operators and travel agents on Saturday, July 2nd, 
          2005 at the Retro Café in Santo Domingo. This event was held 
          in response to the overwhelming inquires into the new executive air 
          connection between Herrera (Santo Domingo’s downtown airport) and Isla 
          Grande (San Juan’s downtown airport). Over 200 people attended the event, 
          including many travel professionals and companies and local media from 
          Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic and San Juan, Puerto Rico.<BR> <BR>
          “This event was much needed, stated Oscar Hasan, VIVA’s President and 
          CEO. We receive numerous calls each week about our daily flights to-and-from 
          Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico and to inquire about other upcoming 
          routes. We needed to introduce ourselves to the travel industry and 
          start positioning EC AIR as the new choice for air service between the 
          two islands and the Caribbean marketplace.” <p>VIVA is currently scheduling 
            additional introductory events for the near future for both EC AIR 
            and VIVA Air Dominicana, S.A. which will coincide with upcoming travel 
            related conferences and tradeshows on both islands. </p>
          <p>In addition, VIVA has begun a new media program to promote VIVA to 
            the investment community. Beginning on Monday, July 11th, VIVA has 
            scheduled a series of interviews with media companies in areas of 
            trade magazines, newsletters and radio. The company hopes to establish 
            itself as a “recognized newcomer” in the aviation community and to 
            reach more potential investors to meet its growth requirements.<br>
            <br>
            “We are finally ready to entertain the requests for interviews, stated 
            Pier S. Bjorklund, a spokesman for VIVA. For the past several months, 
            we have held back on media interviews as we felt the timing was not 
            right. We needed to focus our time to being operational. Now that 
            we have started our air services with EC Air and gearing up service 
            for VIVA Air Dominicana, S.A., we are glad to provide the public with 
            an inside view of our achievements, daily demands and upcoming challenges 
            as we embrace our dramatic growth cycle.”<br>
            <br>
            Over the next several months, VIVA has scheduled with media companies 
            interested in the company’s business story. Some of theses media sources 
            are as follows:</p>

        <TD valign="top">VIVA's market research projects that sufficient demand 
          for air travel to and from the Caribbean hub of the Dominican Republic 
          exists to support a new airline carrier and that revenues of over $30 
          million dollars are attainable in its first full 12 months of operations. 
          The projections assume the utilization of 4-10 aircraft and highly selective 
          "niche" routes. These sales figures are based upon initial routes from 
          Santo Domingo to Saint Kitts, Caracas Venezuela, Punta Cana Dominican 
          Republic, Bonaire, Santiago Dominican Republic, Havana, Cancun, Santa 
          Cruz Columbian, Port au Prince Haiti, Georgetown Guyana, Baranquilla

      border=0 align=right>In addition to routine vacation and business traffic, 
          the explosive Hispanic population in the United States has created a 
          dynamic demographic for travel to Central and South America via the 
          Caribbean. Further, the consolidation of the airline industry since 
          the events of 9/11/2001 has created a vacuum of service capability into 
          the Islands and a demand that is currently being tended to by traditional 
          high cost carriers. In the Caribbean market, there are several US and 
          International carriers that offer direct flights to the islands. American 
          Airlines, Continental Airlines and Pan Am (to our surprise they actually 
          still exist) are the primary US carriers to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin 
          Islands. In addition, American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta 
          and Spirit Airlines service the Dominican Republic. International carriers 
          such as Air Europa, Air France, KLM and Martin Air service many of the 
          other islands, but very few US or International carriers, if any, service 
          low economic countries such as Haiti. 
          <P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 5pt 0in"><FONT face=Arial size=2>Puerto 
            Rico has become a large hub for US domestic flights to the Caribbean, 
            but it comes with high air operational expenses like that of the US 
            mainland. Connections exist from Puerto Rico through out most of the 
            Caribbean, however, connections to low economic countries and services 
            from island-to-island are very limited. These routes are usually offered 
            by Mexican, Central or South American air carriers making for long 
            trips and many connections on otherwise, simple routes. This problem 
            opens the door for another Puerto Rican type of hub in Santo Domingo, 
            Dominican Republic.</FONT></P>
          <P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 5pt 0in"><FONT face=Arial size=2><B>The 
            Dominican Republic is arguably the best place in the Caribbean to

            utilizing the flow of travelers to and from the United States directly, 
            however, more so than from Puerto Rico. The Dominican Republic, in 
            particular, is advantageous due to the significant cost benefits (wages, 
            rents, airport cost etc.) that are implicit to the local economy.</FONT></P>

        <TD>Over the past 20 years, the majors have been characterized by mergers 
          and acquisitions. Like so many other industries, it has quickly evolved 
          into major "fish" in a "small" pond. Initially, smaller players gave 
          way to competition and consolidation. However, since the tragic days 
          of 9/11/2001, the majors have experienced "seriously" diminishing air 
          travelers and have found themselves in a harder position to compete 
          in the marketplace. In addition, smaller "specialty" or "niche" participants 
          such as <FONT color=#800000><B>Southwest Airlines</B></FONT> <FONT color=#800000>(LUV)</FONT> 
          and <B><FONT 
      color=#000080>JetBlue</FONT></B><FONT color=#000080> (JBLU)</FONT> have 
          had major success offering "low cost" more "customer service" oriented 
          traveling experience.<BR>
          <IMG height=175 src="http://www.politicalstump.org/newsletters/issues/vivi/070705/image_05.gif" 
      width=207 align=right border=0><BR>
          As a result, two specialty segments, <B>"priceniche"</B> and <B>"route 
          niche"</B>, have been exploited by new entrants to the market. The "price 
          niche" focuses on charging less while the "route niche" centers on providing 
          either the only service between two given points or else a superior, 
          more convenient, and less costly alternative between two heavily traveled 
          destinations. In today's marketplace, "price" positioning, by itself, 
          is no longer a sufficient concept on which to build an airline. Since 
          deregulation, the flying public has been inundated with low fares and 
          in today's market such prices have become an expectation, not a promise. 
          Thus, the true market segment opportunities have become a combination 
          of service mixed with price and route selection. The most critical decision, 
          therefore, to predicate airline market value and success has become 
          that of choosing the service mix and price in conjunction with the length 
          of route.<BR>
          <BR>
          Viva International believes that their research has clearly demonstrated 
          there is room in their target markets for both a long and short haul 
          carrier that efficiently serves specific routes by leveraging new technologies 
          and employing only route appropriate aircraft. VIVA plans to utilize 
          these openings in the market as the centers of a profitable strategy 
          for ticket sales, aircraft acquisition, and route development.<br>
