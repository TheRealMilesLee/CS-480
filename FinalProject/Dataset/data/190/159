Station 4 overhaul meeting. 

  Today discussions took place in reference to the overhaul work scopes for all three units at station 4. Participants included  Jonny Hendricks, Randy Johnson, Rick Smith, Matt Frances, and myself. From the Gallup team we had Pat Troncoso, Walt Rhoda, and Robert Stearns. We also had Roy Smith on the Phone for discussion on unit 401.

  During discussions on unit 401 which is the line bore project we discussed option to correct bearing problems related to the alignment on unit 401. It was suggested  that the problem could probably be corrected by installing a custom built bearing in the journal that appears to be out of align with the rest. We are making arrangements to take the unit down so that measurement can be taken so the custom bearing can be built. By going this route the outage time required to complete will be significantly reduced as will as the overall cost. The original outage was 40 days. Now we should be able to complete the work indicated on the scope in about 14 days. We are still planning to complete the compressor work that was in the scope along with R&R on turbo coolers and some miner upper end work.

  Scope of work for unit 402, and 403 remains pretty much the same. The only thing that was changed from the original scope was the plan to change all main bearings on both units. At this time we do not see any reason for that so none will be changed. The Gallup team plans to boreascope the units during there upcoming outage for maintenance. If anything is identified by the team or by Matt during the analysis we will make the appropriate arrangements to cover that cost during our outage.

  Please take a look at the attached scopes to verify that the changes we discussed are complete and nothing is left out.

Thanks for everyone's participation!

Ronnie.....
