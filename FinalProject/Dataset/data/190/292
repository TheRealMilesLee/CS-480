Sheila,
Friday at 10:00 works for Mike Galvan and me. Sally will not really be involved in the process and probably does not need to attend unless she wants to for overview purposes. See you then.

Would you be available to meet on Friday, Jan 11th at 10am to review the new cash approval tool and the associated processes? We are trying to get everyone up to speed the week in an effort to implement starting Monday.  
 
Location:  EBN 2750
 
Please advise
