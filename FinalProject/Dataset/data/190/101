Two of the games featured in this newsletter star characters who debuted 10 or more years ago. Frogger, that old traffic dodger, has seen a recent resurgence on the Game Boy Advance and other platforms, while Sega spokesmascot Sonic the Hedgehog is soon to debut on both the GameCube and the GBA in two games that work cooperatively. Other characters who've made recent comebacks include Pac-Man, Pitfall Harry <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005BJ9C/ref=mk_del_248439_22>, and the vampire hunters of Castlevania <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005BJ9G/ref=mk_del_248439_23>. These games aren't just retreaded classics, either--they incorporate modern game elements and up-to-date graphics. So here's my question: which long-lost video game or character would you like to see make a return? Let everyone know on our Computer & Video Games Discussion Board <http://prospero.amazon.com/n/mb/listsf.asp?webtag=am-compgames>. Personally, I'd love to see versions of Spy Hunter for both the GameCube and GBA. Game on! --Porter <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/cm/member-glance/-/ATE2O3KMNTSKJ/ref=mk_del_248439_24>

Frogger's Adventures: Temple of the Frog <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005NCAD/ref=mk_del_248439_27> has our hero chasing the evil Mr. D through 15 levels to get the goods. Contributing writer Raymond Padilla had this to say in his Amazon.com review of the game: "The simple gameplay of the original Frogger is intact, but the developers have added clever levels, bright graphics, and modern game mechanics to the mix."

The blazing blue hedgehog rolls onto the GBA in Sonic Advance <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005MO5G/ref=mk_del_248439_37>, an adventure that sticks close to the side-scrolling Genesis games of long ago.
