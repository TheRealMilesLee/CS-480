Jeff,

Thanks for the invite.  Yes, we would like to participate in the conf. call.  The only definite conflict I have is on Dec. 3 & 4 as I will be traveling to SF for SoCal's BCAP PHC. Let me know the scheduled time etc, as I will probably have some of our regulatory people also sit in on the conference.  Thanks again.

Glen

PG&E called.  They want to set up a conference call to brief us on the gas piece of their POR that they'll be filing with FERC around November 30th.  They want to try to do it in the next couple of weeks. Please let me know if you're interested and please pass this along to anyone else who might be interested.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
