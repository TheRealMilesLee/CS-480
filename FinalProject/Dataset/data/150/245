Ray,

Eddie Meche (CRO) and Jim Bob Perkins (President) from Reliant will be meeting with you and I in your offices at 8:00AM.   The purpose of the meeting is to continue to educate Reliant on our current financial position.  They have been supportive in the market until last week where they came out with a public announcement with concerns about Enron.  Our hope is to give them further disclosure to get them comfortable with our near term and long term financial plans.  They have $100mm gross exposure ($50mm net exposure) to Enron and have recently slowed trading volumes.

Feel free to give me a call if you need further breifings.  I will be in the office about 7:00AM.

Thanks,
Bill
