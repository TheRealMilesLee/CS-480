<DIV></DIV>&gt;requirements. Please keep in mind that your resume will be kept active in our 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;database for one year. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;What else do you need to know? Well, maybe that NIKE values the global 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;diversity of our employees, athletes and customers. We're committed to a 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;workplace based on performance and respect - so our employment opportunities
