Hello -

I was searching your website for capabilities on emissions trading. I
understand you conduct and enhance market information as well as establish
custom solutions that enable environmental compliance. I was wondering if
you an provide some information on your services, and what the current
trends are for SOx and NOx emissions trading. How does Enron participate ?
Most importantly, I was wondering if you have available data on cost
savings for Enron itself as well as others in the industry.

Thank you for your help - I look forward to your reponse.

Sincerely,
Jenny Parmar
