Geetings Kevin:

Wanted to touch base to make sure that CNRL signs agency papers, preferably before we do the release on PGT's electronic board. Gerald Nemec is our attorney and he has put together language surrounding our responsibilities for other agency deals. As I understand, we will mangage all aspects of the transporation agreement which includes review of invoices and the ability to net transportation charges from the supply payment. 

Please advise if you need assistance from either Gerald or me in this regard.

Thanks,

Stephanie
