WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 -  "The oil and gas industry is on high alert after a Federal Bureau of Investigation warning that Osama bin Laden may have ordered retaliatory strikes against North American natural gas facilities in event of his capture or death", news sources said Monday.   

The FBI alerted the American Petroleum Institute, who works directly with Energy Department on security, to issue a warning to oil and gas companies.

"We have received uncorroborated information that Osama bin Laden may have
approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the United States," said
the memo, adding that the information was "from a source of undetermined
reliability." 

The FBI warning continued that "such an attack would allegedly take place in
the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either
captured or killed."

Representatives from the world's leading energy companies, policy makers and industry experts will gather January 24, 2002 in Washington DC at the World Energy Security and Commerce forum (http://www.wesc.org) to discuss the new realities facing executives responsible for securing energy assets, transporting them to market and balancing changing political climates.
