I'm putting one up - I just sent it in to be
scanned/approved, whatever they do, I just didn't at
first because I wasn't really gung ho about doing this
- I sort of just filled out the profile and sat back. 
But I think it's actually pretty cool.  I'm surprised
there are so many normal people doing this, aren't
you?  So, what made you decide to do this?  And will
you ever tell anyone that you did/are???
