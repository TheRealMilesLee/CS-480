Dear Sir or Madam,

Carolina Power & Light Company (CP&L) is seeking your long term gas supply
bid for one of their new generating facilities. Attached are two documents:
*	a letter requesting your bid and
*	our Special Provisions addendum to the GISB Base Contract for Short
Term Sale And Purchase Of Natural Gas.
These two documents plus that GISB standard contract combine to create the
terms and conditions of the RFP.

You are encouraged to submit your bid via e-mail. CP&L has compiled a
supplier database, made confirmations calls, and sent and received test
e-mails. FAX response is acceptable, but e-mail is preferred.

Bids are due no later than December 12, 2001 @ 10:00 a.m. EST.

We look forward to your response. Please feel free to contact the parties

Thank you.
