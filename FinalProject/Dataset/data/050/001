worthy Christian
Mrs. Joy Dish Khushab


NOTE REPLY THIS MAIL TO: joykhushab@latinmail.com 

I am Mrs. Joy Khushab,a Pakistani national I was
married to Dr.Khushab who worked with Pakistan
embassy in China for nine years before he died in theyear 2001.We were married for twive years and theunion unfortunately did not produce any offspring.
Before his death we had given our lives to Christ and were living according to the Word.
A few weeks ago i was diagnosed with cancer and the
doctor has informed me that i do not have much time to live. Presently I am practically an invalid as the cancer has ravaged my body and i can feel my life slowly ebbing away. I do not have much time to do the Lord's work but He will give me strength to see my last assignment through.
My husband, Dr .Khushab before his death deposited his life savings of approximately Sixty Million Five hundred thousand U.S. Dollars with a financial institution in the European continent. Before his death, we were committed to the growth of the church and the propagation of the word, but 
I can no longer partake in these noble tasks. 

I need a church,Christian individual or individuals who can continue the work in our stead. who will utilize this money theway I am going to instruct here into-fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God andto ensure that the house of God is maintained. 
To care for the sick, the poor, the downtrodden wherever they may be The Bible made us to understand that blessed is  the hand that gives. I took this decision because I don'thave any child or next of kin who can inherit these monies.
Though the internet is a seemingly unlikely
place to find such individuals, I believe that the
Lord hide s jewels in the most unlikely places. It is not the means that is important but the message.
I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the
Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of financial institution in Europe. 

I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of
this fund. I want you and the church to always pray
for me because the lord is my shepherd. Happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian.
Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I
stated herein. Hoping to hearing from you. Remain
blessed in the name of the Lord.

N.B-PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THE LAWYER IN
CHARGE A CALL IMMEDIATELY HE IS PRESENTLY IN England ,HE DOES EVERYTHING ON MY BEHALF AND HE'S VERY UNDERSTANDING AND I BELIEVE HE WILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR SUCCESS IN JESUS
