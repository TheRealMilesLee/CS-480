Good morning:

I have returned from an amazing "vacation" in Hawaii and it is good to be
home.  I played a ton of golf (thanks to my friend Pritch) and even rested
some.

I am playing in the Houston City Amateur this Friday, Saturday and Sunday at
Memorial Park.  To my Houston friends, please feel free to come out to the
park if your weekend schedule permits and you want a bit of sun and
exercise.  I'm first off tomorrw at 7:45am and Saturday, I tee off at
12:15pm.

This was one of the last places Meredith and I were together the day she
died.  My brother, Ford, is coming in from Austin to caddy for me for this
tournament as well as a qualifier for the USGA Mid-Am on Monday at
Shadowhawk.  It promises to be a special weekend for me and for us.

I continue to walk through the pain and loneliness.  Each day seems to bring
new challenges, but I press on.  I am shocked and saddened by the events on
the east coast just like everyone, but we will be a stronger and more
compassionate nation going forward.  A most unfortunate event, I know there
are so many, many families now who can partially identify with my loss.

God bless you all.  I look forward to visiting with everyone in the coming
weeks and months.

Love,

Tim
