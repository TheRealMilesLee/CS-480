Lousie,
My group gathers the gas and power physical volumes that are used in quarterly press releases, SEC filings and other communications.  Investor relations typically likes to look at this information on a monthly basis to make sure that they understand the direction that volumes are going.  The attached file details gas and power volumes by region for the most recent periods.  The gas volumes from July to August of this year show a slight downward trend that I wanted to make sure that you were aware of.  We pull this information from the Unify settlement system and have rarely had problems with the accuracy of that data.  None the less, we typically run it by desk heads when the numbers don't seem to fit our expectations.  After a brief review by the Central and East guys they told us that lower price volatility and the ICE trading platform were the significant reasons for the decline.  Is this in line with your expectations?  Power volumes on the other hand are up considerably in August.  We have not received a response on that yet.

Please call me if you would like to discuss.
