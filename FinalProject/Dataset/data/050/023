To all
We have covered most of the routes on the ground, but are unable to fly at this time.
Current plans are to stay in Phoenix until we can fly the routes by helicopter.
The route north out of the cavern site( common to both I 17 and the El Paso options) is very congested with development.
The route south from the cavern to the Panda Energy tie-in is even more congested and will require extensive detailed analysis. We will most likely have to go NW from the site around Luke Air Force base and about 6-8 miles west before we can turn south and head to the proposed Panda/El Paso tie in point at MP 619.
 
We have obtained a very detailed air photo booklet of maps ( indicating subdivision development and county planning)that we can use to evaluate the route options both north and south from caverns, so will be able to study on paper over the next 2-3 days if we are unable to fly by helicopter.
All for now

Thanks Scott.  I am now back in Houston and will be available the rest of the week.  I understand that Larry Campbell and Doug Cebryk are having problems getting a helicopter off the ground in Arizona.  Right now they are just driving various possible routes. John

Mr. Diaz,

John Shafer has asked me to contact you in response to my question regarding
what your schedule is to receive our preliminary cost estimate for the
environmental portion of the Sun Devil Project.  Please let me know the date
by which you would like to see them so that we can arrange our schedules
accordingly.  Thank you,  Scott
