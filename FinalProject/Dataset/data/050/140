I agree, our map was probably used for the base map

		I have a copy of Phoenix area map.  On the bottom is a box
that says
		"Base map used by the authority of copyright license through
the
		courtesy of Arizona State Highway Department."  Could this
just be a
		highway map that someone later added pipelines too?  Do you
have a phone
		/ contact name for the Phoenix / Maricopa ADOT district
office?

		thanks for your help.

		The only records ADOT will keep to this regard is for the
permit each
		company receives for each facility crossing state right of
way.  This
		info
		can be obtained from each district permits office.  For any
state wide
		mapping we suggest you contact the owner (El Paso Natural
Gas, etc.)
		directly.

		I'm looking for an AZ state map that has natural gas
pipeline
		information relative to state / federal highway systems.  I
would
		especially like to see something for Maricopa County.  Is
this type of
		info available on-line?  If not, who would I contact to get
a printed
		copy?

		thanks for your help.
