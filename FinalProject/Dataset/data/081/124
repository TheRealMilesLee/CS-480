Gentlemen:

I have a call in to Thane Twiggs from Regulatory affairs to ask what is at the bottom of this.  Obviously this is a bad situation.

Regards,

QSEs that are owed monies from ERCOT on invoices that are due today, October 15, 2001, will notice that the amount of funds transferred is short of the balance due on the invoice. This is a notification that ERCOT will follow the "short payment" procedure stated in the ERCOT protocols for payments being made to QSEs today.  Due to short payments by one or more QSEs, ERCOT is insufficient of funds to pay all amounts in full.  As described in the ERCOT protocols, section 9.4.4, ERCOT will deduct ERCOT administrative fees and reduce payments to all invoice recipients that are owed monies. The reductions will be based on a pro rata basis of monies owed to each ERCOT creditor for this invoice to the extent necessary to clear ERCOT's accounts on the payment date to insure revenue neutrality for ERCOT. ERCOT will distribute past due funds on a pro rata basis of monies owed on the next business day after receipt of the monies. 
If you have any questions, please call your ERCOT client service representative.
