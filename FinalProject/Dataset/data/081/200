It looks like we are close to nailing down the license agreement for POPS with AEP.  There are no major issues with the license agreement.  They want us commit to assigning a resource for about two man months of work to help them bring up the application.  We would bill them $150/hour for this service in addition to the $1,750,000 for the license and source code.  If we can work out a schedule for half days at Enron and the other half at HPL then I think we have a deal.  -  Tommy
