loser. it's 'better off dead' with John Cusack - popular when we were kids. unfortunately you were a dork and didn't play with the other kids your age, so you missed it. great line but means nothing if you haven't seen the movie.
 
can i come collect my $ from you today? i owe it to the box (it's a long story, i'll tell you later.) MSA
