          Janette,
          With reference to our telephone conversation of last Friday, I talked to Jaime Alatorre.
           He will not be  able to be with Mr. Haedicke tomorrow Tuesday Oct. 16 at 2:00 o'clock, as he already had made an appoitnment.
           He mentioned that maybe the best time would be after finishing the staff meeting. (He thinks Mr. Haedicke will
           also be in the same meeting).
          Do you think they could meet tomorrow at around 5:15 pm.?
          If this is not possible, he will talk to you later, as he is out of the office in a Seminar this morning. 

          Thank you, Ma. Elena
