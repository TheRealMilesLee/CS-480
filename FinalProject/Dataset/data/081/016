You and your family are missed already by me and my family.  We hated to see you leave but sometimes you gotta to do what you gotta do.  I pray that the church family that you become a part of makes you as happy as you made our family.  Please don't  forget that we are still here on Hombly Road.  We love you and wish you and yours the best of everything.  Our prayers are with you.   
 
Your friend and (use to be family,  ha, ha)
The Sumblers and Williams
