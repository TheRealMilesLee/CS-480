                             PROPOSAL FOR URGENT  ASSISTANCE

Compliments of the day!! 

As a matter of utmost urgency I want you to come to my assistance. I found your contact while I 
was doing a private research on the Internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that
will assist me and my family. I am ROSE MUTHALABI  the WIFE of MR. MICHEAL MUTHALABI of Zimbabwe.

During the current war against farmers in Zimbabwe and from the support of our PRESIDENT 
ROBERT MUGABE to claim all the white owned farms in our country, all the white farmers were 
ordered to surrender their farms to his party members and his followers due to their selfish 
political interest. My husband who was one of the richest & best farmers in our country, and 
also the treasurer of the white farmers co-operation did not support his idea and so the 
party members (ZANUPF) invaded my husband farms and burnt everything in the farm, killed 
my husband and made away with a lot of items in the farm,the same thing they did to other 
farmers.

After the death of my husband, I and my family decided to move out of Zimbabwe with the money 
that my husband kept in his hidden safe in his house because our lives were in danger . The 
amount contained in the safe is US$18.5M (Eighteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States 
Dollars) and we decided to code the money and move to the Republic of South Africa a 
neighbouring contry to Zimbabwe, where we deposited the money in a Security Company for safe 
keeping as a family valuable item.

So I decided to make contacts with a foreign faithful individual or company whom will assist 
us to move this money out of South Africa, because we are asylum seekers here in South Africa, 
and the law of the country does not permit us some civil rights such as owing or operating a 
bank account due to our status as refugees.

So if you consider this proposal, we have agreed to give you 20% of the total sum for helping 
us to move this money out to your country and 5% will be mapped out for expenses both of us 
may incure during this transaction and 75% will be for me and family to invest in your country 
as we have decided to leave South to reside permanently oversea. All I want is for you to 
furnish me with all your banking details and your personal phone and fax numbers for easy 
communication.You can contact my son Bude on the above email address.
NOTE: That this transaction is 100% risk free and absolutely confidential.

Therefore, be kind to clarify the following for my family consideration:

1. Can your account accommodate this fund in your local bank without government intervention 
or do you have an account outside your country where you may consider safe for this fund?. 
2. What are taxation in your country like as I desire a low/free tax zone?. 
3. What are the interest rates on long/short term fixed deposit in your local banks?. 
4. What other lucrative investments would you suggest as I intend banking, real estate and 
hotels if they are good business venture in your Country?. 
5. Can you be able to make residential documents and purchase a house for me and my family 
to relocate and settle in your country?.

MRS. ROSE MUTHALABI.
