Tom, I have left you a voice mail about this issue......please call so that we may discuss .....the Master was amended to add a Independent Amount and the definition used is a formula and the formula is unusual....it seems that subpart (a) is the applicable subpart, but we are unable to verify the numbers provided by Jay.  bng
