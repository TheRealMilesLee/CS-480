Is anyone familiar with the requirement in providing sidewalks along 
a public street?  The fellow that tore up our brand new Welch street 
back in October has torn up the sidewalks on Welch and planted grass 
in their place.  Isn't he required to keep the sidewalks that existed 
before?  There are sidewalks on both sides of Welch all the way from 
Taft to Montrose with the exception of the stretch in front of his 
new townhomes.
