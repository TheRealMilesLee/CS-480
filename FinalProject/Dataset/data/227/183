ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================================
Summary of February 10, 2002

======================================================

Dear Folks ­


   I want to thank Stephanie Warfield for filling in for me this past
weekend. I was away making a private retreat. Stephanie always does a good
job.

   At the gathering on Sunday John Staley volunteered to facilitate the
creation of a book discussion group. Jerrilynn Dougherty volunteered to
assist with this. If you would like to know more, you can contact John at

Welcomingfriends@aol.com

   Richard Wingfield forwarded to me a list of the folks who have committed
to step forward to support the work in Bolivia. Each of the following
persons has agreed to support one month at $250.
   1. Wayne Herbert
   2. Bill Kerley
   3. Richard Wingfield
   4. Robert Bell
   5. Phill Lewis
   6. Kim Watson/Richard Stang
   7. Kristine & Paul Brooks
   8. Nancy Pustka
   9. Jean Snyder
  10. Marte Nelson
  11. John M. Howard. Jr.
  12. James Sasser.

   Thanks to you all.

   Tomorrow is, for Christians, the beginning of Lent. It is a significant
time, full of rich rituals. It is a time when we are encouraged to seek for
clarity about those two significant spiritual questions - "who are we and
what are we to do."

   With renewed threats of terrorist activity it is easy for us to forget
these. I'm looking forward to being with you this coming Sunday as we
continue our conversation along the way from here to there. More on this in
the preview that will come to you later this week.

Much love,


Bill Kerley
