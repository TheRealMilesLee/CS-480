Rob may have read of these things in fairy tales and books of travel, b=
ut if so they had entirely slipped his mind; so he slumbered peacefully =
and actually snored a little, I believe, towards morning
But even as the red sun peeped curiously over the horizon he was awaken=
ed by a most unusual disturbance--a succession of hoarse screams and a p=
ounding of the air as from the quickly revolving blades of some huge win=
dmill

 hand was an immense bird, whose body seemed almost as big as that of a =
horse
