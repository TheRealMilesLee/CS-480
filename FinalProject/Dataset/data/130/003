Elliot,

I spoke with Rogers about the renewables function within EES Risk Management.  It seems as though Richard Ring has a clear mandate to set up a book and cover the short positions in the East.  It sounds like our EES position in the West is more manageable (slightly long).  Rogers and I agreed that you and Richard should work together to the extent it makes sense, but there is no pressing need to try to re-org anything at this time - this can be adressed at year-end or Q1.  In general, your objectives should be to try to transact through EES or with wholesale parties.  Rogers is focused on covering his short position so I think there is an orig opportunity for you if you can procure tags that can be used in the East.       

Tim or Elliot let me know if you want to discuss further.
