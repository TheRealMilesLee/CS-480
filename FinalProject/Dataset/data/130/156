Lindy -

While it is fresh on my mind -- it would be great if you could capture the
following information before our meeting:


 - the amount of Unamoritized Accrued Earnings related to Gallup (remember
- Andersen wouldn't let us take it as MTM) [Centilli should have access to
this information]
- the amount of the rebates you have been receiving from ECS for Gallup
related to the demand charge miss [Centilli should have access to this
information]
- copies of all the ECS agreements (Bisti, Bloomfield, Gallup, WT1,
Hubbard)
- Hubbard run hours and payments ECS - last 3 years [you can ask John Sturn
for this]
- Projected amount of TW fuel over collection 2002
- A list of the other ETS electric compressors [John Sturn]
- Total non-compressor related electric charges ETS paid in 2000 and 2001 -
someone in Wasaff's group should have this / or someone in Omaha.


See you then.


Dave
