Here are a few opportunities to celebrate Thanksgiving with the Second 
Baptist family and make the holiday brighter for those less fortunate in 
our community.

Thanksgiving Services
"It's a Time to Give Thanks!" - Join the Second Baptist Family as we celebrate 
Thanksgiving with a special worship service filled with music, testimonies 
and a tribute to some of our hometown heroes. Plan to attend one of these 
special services: 

West Campus -Sunday, November 18th at 6 p.m. 

Woodway Campus - Tuesday, November 20th at 6:30 p.m. 

Angels of Light
This is the final weekend (Saturday and Sunday- November 17th & 18th) to 
bring your non-perishable food, wrapped toys or used clothing for Angels 
of Light. 
Don't miss this opportunity to make the holiday season a little brighter 
for someone special. Donations may be dropped off at either campus of Second 
Baptist Church.
