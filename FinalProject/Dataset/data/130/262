Thank you for taking time to come to our Gas Logistics Staff meeting on Tuesday.  My apologies to those individuals that were inadvertently dropped from the email distribution.  I will schedule time to visit with anyone that missed the staff meeting.

I know that you are all still searching for answers to the Enron events of the last few weeks.   You asked lots of good questions at the meeting.  At the bottom of this email are responses to a few additional questions.  As I said at the meeting, while I am discouraged by recent events, I am really proud of ETS and of our Gas Logistics Team and I am looking forward to showing off our pipeline successes to the Dynegy management team in the future. 

With the Thanksgiving holiday just around the corner, I'd like to take the opportunity to wish you and your family a safe and happy holiday season.  I hope that you can spend time with your families and friends away from the demands of work.  I'd also like to put two dates on your calendar to celebrate work accomplishments with our team.

Team Celebration.  First, I hope you can attend a celebration on November 29 at the Doubletree honoring the Gas Logistics team and the new Contracts/Capacity Release team.  The celebration will include food, games and prizes.  Alma Carillo will be sending out all the details.  
Holiday Luncheon.  Second, get out your recipe books and start cooking, because it's also time for our Gas Logistics Holiday Banquet on December 11th in ECN42C2 from 11:30am - 1:30pm.  I'll provide the ham and turkey and team members can sign-up to bring a covered dish.  Ricki Winters will send around a sign-up sheet to make sure that we don't end up with 10 green bean casseroles. 



Follow-Up Q/A

Can Employees still order computers from the Click at Home program?
As of today, the Click at Home program has not been cancelled.  The web site is working and eligible employees are able to place orders.

Regarding loans from the Saving Plan, is there any requirement for accelerated loan payment if the value of the loan exceeds the current value of the savings plan account?
For active employees, loan payment amounts will not change during the term of the loan, even if the outstanding balance of the loan exceeds the value of the account.

Does the company have any position on employee participation in class action suits?  
No.  The decision whether to participate in a suit is a personal decision and is unrelated to an individual's employment.
