Maybe so, I'm guessing that is during Spring Break again?  Not too sure if
I really liked it with that many people out there, too many high dollar
tables.  Have you guys already made reservations?  Give me a little more
info but I kind have been saving for the house.  It should be ready around
late March or early April and I know I will have to buy a lot of stuff for
that, like a kegorator you know important things.

So what's the latest at Big E or I guess Little E now.  You think you guys
will go to the new joint venture or what ever happens to the trading
company when they sell it off?  Have you been looking?

Keep me in the loop.

Kyle

Subject: Valero at Enron Job Fair on Friday


Hey guys just thought I would let you know that Valero is going to be at
the Job Fair this Friday at Enron Field from 1-4 and I will be one of the
people attending it to represent us.  So if you are going to be there make
sure you come by and at least say hello.  Plus depending on when my flight
back is going to be and how soon I can leave the Fair we plan on going
somewhere and getting a couple of drinks.  So come by drop off a resume and
maybe we can get some drinks.

Note:  If you are interested in Valero there is a very good possibility
that the Director of Mid-Office will be attending as well and it would be a
good chance for an informal interview.

Hope everybody is doing alright and pass the word on to anybody I may have
missed.

Kyle
