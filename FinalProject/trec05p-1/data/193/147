good day everyone

Christianity is part of the Common Law of England.
It is not the mountains we conquer but ourselves.
Fear the man who fears you.

Too, through free agreement there has been produced, a final clarification of spheres in the functions of the state and of one Church
I distrust camels, and anyone else who can go a week without a drink.
Self-reliance, the height and perfection of man, is reliance on GodObey the voice at eve obeyed at prime
That which resembles most living one's life over again, seems to be to recall all the circumstances of it; and, to render this remembrance more durable, to record them in writing.

Qui' b'o'tic
