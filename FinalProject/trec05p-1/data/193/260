I think we need to crystallize, in very short order, what the approval process will be for the sale of the Pad Gas in Storage Caverns #13/#14 to Bridgeline.  I will send you via fax the proposed deal sheet.

Several interesting points from the meeting:

1)  Bridgeline is of the view that 3/12/2002 (we thought it was 4/402) is the last day on which they are obligated to reimburse Enron for the Dow Lease - Any thoughts?  Who is right?;

2)  Their plan (assuming our deal goes through) is to amend and assume the existing lease - and get Dow to expressly release LRCI from any and all claims/liabilities/etc. following Bridgeline's assumption of the amended lease;

3)  Bridgeline indicated that Dow is of the opinion that approximately $167k is owed by Enron for dewatering brine removal fees ($0.20 per ton of salt removed) - I need your help to determine whether this is accurate;

4)  Bridgeline is desirous of having Cavern #1 (along with the various rights-of-way) conveyed sooner rather than later (and wondered whether we could expedite the approval process on this part of the deal).  I don't know what the advantages/disadvantages there are to this but would love your input along with your thoughts on whether this is feasible or not;

5)  We indicated that we thought the approval process would take approximately 30 days from the day that we reached what we believed were mutually agreeable terms with Bridgeline (does this sound right?) - The goal is to be done no later than March 1, 2002; and

6)  Eric Booth is going to call Robert Morgan to get the support for the $550k of expenses relating to the dewatering line and the flowline.
