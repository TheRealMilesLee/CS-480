Dear St. Arnold's Army: 

Got that January lethargy?  Experiencing post-holiday doldrums?  If so, you need to drink more St. Arnold's!  This elixir is known to create excitement in your life and can cure the common cold.  And here is a reminder about some events also sure put a smile on the face of even the biggest curmudgeon.    

Cigar Night II - Wednesday, January 23, 2002 
The first one was a huge success.  For reservations, please call the brewery or email dan@saintarnold.com.  There are a limited number of spaces left and they are filling up quickly. 

Admission: $20 (includes the two cigars)  
Date: Wednesday, January 23 
Time: 6 pm - 9 pm  
Where: Saint Arnold Brewery 
       2522 Fairway Park Dr. 

To make your reservation, we will need the following info: 
Your Name: 
Number of People in your Group: 
Credit Card Number: 
(we will not be running the credit cards until the night of the event, so if you want to pay cash at the door, that will be an option.) 

The Julian Calendar New Year Party at Garden in the Heights This Sunday 
This Sunday, January 13!  Lots of fun!  Lots of dancing!  Very Eastern European/Russian ethnic!  Cheap with this email! 
Date and Time: Sunday, January 13TH, 2002 - 5:00 PM - Midnight 
Place:  GARDEN in the HEIGHTS, 3926 Feagan  
Admission: $4 with this email, $8 without it. Children 12 and under Free. 

Looking for Christmas Ale? 
We have had some calls from people experiencing Christmas Ale withdrawal.  If you suffer from this ailment, we know of a couple of places with a few cases left.  We can't tell everyone where it is, but if you call or email us, we can tell you individually. 

Spread the Word 
You are the reason that we have experienced such strong growth this past year.  Most people find out about us because someone like you has told them about us (that's a lot of pronouns).  Please keep telling your friends.  Also, if you have a favorite restaurant/bar that doesn't carry our beer, let us know.  If you manage to sell it in, let us know and we will reward you! 

Anyone Seen our Cable TV Ads? 
We have been running some ads on the Optel/Showcase cable network.  We are curious if anyone has seen them.  If so, please let us know (along with any comments).  Did you suddenly experience the uncontrollable urge to open a cold St. Arnold? 

Thanks again for all your support, and remember to recycle your six pack carriers.   

Cheers,
