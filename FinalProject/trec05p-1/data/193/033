Is this value on these deals rought 8K?
If so, tell portfolio acct to put them in and generate a PMA for the gas books.  It is not worth investigating for such a small number and the deal ended 12/01.  Are these the only four deals you have with the gas desk?

This is CGAS Price as of 12/31/01. Merchant Portfolio hedged this position thru the gas desk - then the gas desk hedged with third party.

Per John Lavorato, we killed all desk to desk deals on Dec. 13th.  That is why this deal was killed.  You mentioned that you had price deals that were not killed.  Can you give me deal numbers for those as well and we can take a peak and see why they were not killed.  It is our understanding that all desk to desk(book to book) should be killed because no cash actually changes hands.  Should this deal have been with an external counterparty?

Phillip,

Below is the information for the CGAS book that was killed on 12/13/01.  This book should have liquidated in December.  Can we get this deal back?

Thanks,

Susie
