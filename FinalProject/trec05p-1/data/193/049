Louise,

Carl and I have done a quick once-over on Leslie's GTC. I think the format she has chosen is doable, but I need clarification from her on some points.

It is possible that the market might accept an amended EEI more quickly than they would accept our simple GTC - I don't know.

It is interesting to note that the EEI amendments in Leslie's GTC are 5 pages long (excluding the elections sheets). Our original GTC was 8 pages long.

Louise:

Attached please find the GTCs for power (with and without credit).  Please note that we are actually using the EEI Master Agreement as the on-line contract, as opposed to the traditional GTCs.  We were actually in the process of making this transition on EOL this fall, and Kevin Presto and Tim Belden have endorsed Netco's use of the EEI on-line.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Leslie
