Gerald,

Can you take a look at Mariner's comments on the Confirm and GTC to see if we addressed all of their concerns in the changes that we discussed yesterday? They seem to be ok with most of the contract and only had a few comments.

Thanks,
Judy

Nelson, Please review the changes I made, which should be in bold, red type,
and let me know what you think. Our lawyer has been out and I have not had
the opportunity to let her review. I do not see where she will have
concerns. I wanted to go ahead and send it to you for your input. Thanks.
