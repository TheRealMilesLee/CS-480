To All -

Some weeks ago we initiated the process of amending various agreements with Sempra Energy in order to enable Enron trading entities to confirm transactions with Sempra through CommodityLogic's ConfirmLogic module.  I understand that little to no communications have been undertaken concerning these amendments.  The reason for the lack of responsiveness by Sempra may be in part due to the fact that Sempra has - just recently - released a product within their internet site that enables online confirmation of Sempra transactions.  This product is part of a suite of portfolio products called "SempraLive" and can be found at www.sempratrading.com.

We are currently looking into the background of the development of this product as some concerns have been raised based upon similarities of certain aspects of the Sempra product and the ConfirmLogic product.

Please let me know if any disussions take place concering the CommodityLogic amendments with Sempra.

Thanks.

Mark
