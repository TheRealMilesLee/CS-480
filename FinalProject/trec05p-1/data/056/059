Cara,

We have unrouted all term & daily route for June 22 on pwrtestp and also emptied all path
confirmation records. We have also granted you access to the new application called
'Executive Report' and should be available under  EnPower - > Tools -> Executive Report

Let me know if you have any questions

Regards,
dluu
