Hey guys and girls,

Janell has a Sheraton on the outskirts of town booked on the front end
of the trip.  I sent 17 faxes this morning to hotels in the city center
looking for something closer to our sights.  I received an immediate
response from the Hotel Condotti.  They have 3 standard rooms available.
I believe it is a 3+ star hotel (I'm guessing from the prices they
charge).  From the article in my book, they have recently remodeled.
They are located near our Hotel Firenze between the Spanish Steps and
Plaza Del Popolo.  The rate is 430,000 Lire (approximately $215).  It's
$25 more than the Sheraton but we won't have to taxi between the city
center and the outskirts of town which gives us more flexibility to
easily scoot back to the hotel as we fade with jetlag and eat dinner in
town after a nap.  They also have a 72 hour cancellation policy (there
could be a slight fee to cancel, their fax just says they have a 72 hour
cancellation fee), if we are OK, I'll confirm this cancellation with our
reservation.  

I think we should go with this.  I'm not sure how fast I'll hear from
the others, if at all. 

Please let me know your thoughts ASAP.  

Thanks, Kim.
