Dear Nancy:  We believe your problem sounds as if it is blossom end rot
which is fairly common.  This can result
From a lack of calcium in the soil; however can be alleviated by consistent
watering.  When we have hot, dry spells,
Tomatoes may need more water.  If your plants are stressed from lack of
adequate water you may need to water more often.
It also could be sunburn, but again that is a watering issue.  This
information is from Pests of  the Garden and Small Farm.
Napa Master Gardener - Lynne Wolk

		Our lovely tomatoes are getting big brown blemished on the
bottom of them.
		What causes it and is there anything we can do to stop it??
