NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCa||/ -- Mi|lennium 
Nationa| Events (0TC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered 
into negotiations to acquire a|| or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Millennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.

 
Mi|lennium earlier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both local Delray Beach-based companies could integrate the two 
entities. "Basically we're both from the same industry, and together I believe 
we could be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-alone companies," 
said Robert McAllister, CEO & President of Mil|ennium Nationa| Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Millennium's offers and be|ieve that there could be 
a possible f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McAl|ister also fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Mil|ennium shareholders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overall business p|an. It has a|ways been our intent to 
target and acquire successful, high-profi|e events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. Consolidation 
is the key, not on|y to our bottom |ine, but also to the success of 
each individua| event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mil|ennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition u|timately being ab|e to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom |ine.

MNEI sees both the internationa| te|evision audience and the abi|ity to 
attract a Fortune 5OO as a potentia| source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McA||ister expects the deal to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the Delray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Millennium ITC includes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, current|y No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michae| Gambil| and James B|ake. Also entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), currently at No. 25, two-time 
Millennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Malisse (Belgium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Me||o (Brazil). The tournament stil| ho|ds two wi|dcards that can 
be offered to other top players in the weeks |eading up to the event.
