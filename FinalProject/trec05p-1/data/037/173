I am meeting in SF with our CPUC lawyers about the "Negative CTC Complaint" proceedings (which as you know have been temporarily stayed) from 2:00-4:00 PST on Wednesday.  Are either of your available to participate at least part of the time.  I want to be sure we are coordinated with the class action strategy.  As you know, Richard is sunbathing this week in Rio.
