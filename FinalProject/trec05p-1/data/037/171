Well, we are having to sell it because we are so short of cash right now.
Really for a lot of reasons. We have had to make an investment of our own to
do a demo so we could shop it to labels in the U.S. This is working out well
as we have had a few discussions already. Also there have been some serious
changes in the way U.S. Immigration is working and it has really screwed a
lot of touring bands. It has made us cancel already 10 shows for September.
They basically changed the rules overnight on everybody. There is nothing we
can do about it unless we know a member of Congress or we have a $1000 U.S..
We may have to come up with the $1000. We think that we may be able to book
tours that will allow us to just rent a vehicle when we need one. That is
what we are looking at right now. I am at home by the way, and here until at
least the 15th of September.

Why are you selling the van. Don't you need to get around?  I am not
sure what the outstanding balance is... I will have to check my notes...
Are you in Canada or the U.S.

I was going to send you one in a day or so after I figured out what was
going on. We have put some money already in the bank this month. Ken put
in
$400 and we are trying to get the rest in before the end of the month.
We
are also trying to sell the van. It's tough right now and we need to
make a
few changes. We of course would sell it and pay off the loan with you. I
believe it is around or just under $4000. We will have to work out a
specific balance with you. I hope to sell it soon, but we will have to
wait
and see. Mom does sound well although I wonder if you think she is
getting
the best advice from her lawyer?????? I just think she should get this
over
with. Sounds like maybe she is reticent to go any further. Let me know
what
you think of all this.
