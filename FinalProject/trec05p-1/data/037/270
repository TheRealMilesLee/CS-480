As the FERC mediation process winds down, we can expect ALJ reports to be released starting the week of September 10th.  In light of this, Mark Palmer has suggested a media briefing for the WSJ and various trade pubs among others.  Everyone needs to be thinking about how we might approach organizing this roundtable.
 
One option is to hold the event the day the first ALJ report is released and walk the media through the mediation process (mindful to confidential issues), and explain to them the components we're looking for as well as how the process should move along.
 
Another option is to wait for the report to be released, digest it and then hold the roundtable and explain our interpretation of it and our satisfaction/disatisfaction.
 
Please consider what, if anything, we can do to communicate our RTO message as the reports are released.  I would also like a potential list of invitees (press, and other like-minded energy companies that would want to join us for this type of advocacy).  
 
Is EPSA planning any strategic responses??  
 
Please send me any comments you have by Tuesday, September 4th. 
 
Thanks
