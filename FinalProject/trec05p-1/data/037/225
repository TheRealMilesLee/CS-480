The latest version of SBX2 78 is en route to Houston.  I will forward it to
San Francisco momentarily.  The bill will be taken up in room 4202 at 3:00
p.m. The remaining two sets of amendments which will be discussed today
include SCE's proposed amendments as well as a set of undisclosed amendments
from Keeley.  As of 15 minutes ago, Senator Burton's office continued to
maintain that this bill is dead upon arrival.
