Gentlemen,  FYI.

I am traveling tonight for a meeting tomorrow.  I will return to the office
midday Wednesday, 8/29/01.  You can reach me via cell phone at 970/420-0473
or leave a message on my voice mail.  In my absence, Kim Munson is
collecting the maps and reviewing routing options for Project Sun Devil and
Devyn Richardson is expediting our receipt of the Navajo Nation permit
required for the Red Rock T&E surveys at CS 3 and 4.  You can contact either
of them with information or questions for those projects, respectively,
until I return.  Thanks,  Scott
