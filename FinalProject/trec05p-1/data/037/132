  John, I have prepared a more formal position regarding the exemption of "Compressor Fuel" consumed in a "continuing business activity" (Gas services).  Before I submit this position to you, I will circulate my position letter within the company and validate the facts.  
I will be relying primarily on Colorado Regulations 26-102.21 or 39-26-104.1(d.1).  Have these regulations changed recently?  My service may be out of date.
Attached below are schedules for Compressor and Domestic fuel consumption for the audit period.

Dan,

Here is my initial response.  I haven't had time to do too much research on
this, but this preliminarily the Department's position.  Sorry this took so
long  but I am working on a bankruptcy case which has my first priority.  jp

If the operating agreement constituted the entirety of the writing
accompanying the transfer of cash from Enron to Northwest Pipeline Corp., I
might agree.  But, the purchase agreement lists assets acquired for cash.

I don't believe that the statute and regulation support that position.
Transporting gas would have to qualify as providing gas or electric service
to qualify for the exemption.  I don't believe it does.  I definitely need
more research on this.

The disposition of penalty and interest will be resolved at a level above the auditor level.
