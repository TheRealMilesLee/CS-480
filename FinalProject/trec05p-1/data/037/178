During its 26th annual conference this week, New England governors and Eastern Canadian premiers adopted a self-monitoring resolution to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  Goals set under the plan are:
reduce regional GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2010
reduce regional GHG emissions by 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020
reduce GHG emissions to "eliminate any dangerous to the climate" (perhaps as much as a 75 - 85 percent cut in emissions) over an unspecified longer timeframe

The goals are set with the understanding that they will be met regional and with flexibility for localities to determine the most appropriate emissions reduction strategy.  Development of a regional GHG registry as well as consideration of emissions trading were included in the plan as well as longer term goals related to reducing carbon dioxide emissions per megawatt hour of electricity within the region (20 percent reduction by 2025) and energy conservation (20 percent increase in region by 2025). 

Recommendations on the development of a regional GHG registry will be presented at next year's conference.  A Climate Change Steering Committee will coordinate this work.  Input from governments and stakeholders, including industry is expected.
 
IMPACT: The resolution is non-binding, but does call on states and provinces to develop climate change action plans, which could result in state level regulation and regional (including cross border) trading of greenhouse gas emissions.

Several New England states are considering legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, though no mandatory state-level greenhouse gas programs have been adopted.

The adoption of this resolution demonstrates the growing awareness of global climate change among New England and Canadian constituencies and an interest among policymakers to take steps to mitigate its potential impacts.
