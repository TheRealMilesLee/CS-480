Pat,

Thanks.  As far as I know the Plan document should now be in its final stage.  I'll await to receive hard copies for signature by appropriate exec.

Regards,

Lizzette's changes to the plan document look good to me. 
When the plan document is finalized, we will prepare unanimous consent resolutions for adoption by the board of directors of the two participating employers.  It has always been the Enron practice to have an employer's board of directors approve such a plan for purposes of corporate governance.
