Martin,
Apparently you live right next door to friends of mine.  Dana Welsh and Gerald King were neighbors of mine when I lived in Houston in 1998, and my wife and I still keep in contact with them.  As a matter of fact, we'll be staying with them on November 11 & 12 before their wedding, and might knock on your door to meet you.  Funny, Dana mentioned in the past you worked for Enron, but it's such a big company I didn't think I might know you.

Regards,

T. Scott Campbell
