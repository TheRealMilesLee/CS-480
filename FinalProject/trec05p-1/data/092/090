The Griffith plant is currently down and will probably be down for the rest of the month.  I have put a zero capacity in CAS for the deliveries through 10/31/01.  If it should come up for allocation please analyze whether it is due to flow rate.  As long as it schedules to zero, we are fine, you can ignore the flow rate.  

The contracts which are currently scheduling there must be balanced at zero, if we allocate because of a flow rate the system generates, I may have to put on an imbalance the next morning in order to get the contracts to balance.  If you have any questions while allocating, please ask me.

Thanks for your help in this matter,
Amy
