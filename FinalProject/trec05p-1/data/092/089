Hi Stephanie, 

I just wanted to be sure you received the documents I sent you on Sequent.  I was also wondering where we stand.  If you could let me know I would appreciate it.  

Thanks, 
Leigh

Hi Stephanie,

I work in deal confirmation and have been receiving confirms back from Sequent Energy Management.  The are saying thay it should be Sequent Energy Management L.P. not LLC.  We were wondering if you have recieved documentation of this.  We have documentation of this if you need it.  Please let me know if you reflect this or not.

Thanks, 
Leigh
