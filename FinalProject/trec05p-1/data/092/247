Jeff:
I have a report that talks about Enron in depth, like a former executive wrote it, but its by a group called Global Change Associates.  Would you still like a copy?  Let me know.

Don Miller mentioned that you might have a copy of the "Enron Secrets Revealed!" report from The Power Marketing Association.    We're discussing a partnership with a company that confessed to have recently purchased the report.  I'd like to read it over to better understand what they are thinking.
thanks,
Jeff
