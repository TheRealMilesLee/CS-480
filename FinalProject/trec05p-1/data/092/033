A little old lady was going up and down the halls in a nursing home. 
As she walked, she would flip up the hem of her nightgown and say,
"Super Sex! Super Sex!" 

She walked up to an elderly man in a wheelchair. She flipped her 
gown in front of him and said "Super sex"! 

He sat silently for a moment or two looking up at her. 
Then he finally answered, "I'll take the soup."
