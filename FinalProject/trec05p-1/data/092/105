Jean, Pat:

Jim would like us to discuss next steps. 

In particular what should we do regarding Comission decision to delay retail competition - docket 24468? 


As far as Docket 24469 is concerned (SERC-Texas), please confirm the following:

	*	Comission decision to delay competition applies only to 24468
	*	There is an ongoing hearing on 24469 
	*	Today is the deadline for parties to intervene.
	*	However, Enron is not a party in this hearing; nor we filed any motion to intervene
	*	Comission has not requested Enron a specific Request for Testimony
	*	Arguments for delaying competition in SERC are similar to the ones for SPP
	*	Therefore, Comission may decide to delay retail competition as well
	*	Is there anything we can do about it?

Any other ideas?

LM

The decision is for SPP Texas only - Docket 24468. 

You are right. SERC Texas has a different Docket number - 24469.

Luiz-  

Is this decision for all non-ERCOT Texas?  SPP Texas and SERC Texas?  I understand there are two docket numbers, and SERC Texas has not been decided yet?

The Comission did not set a firm date for opening of the retail market in non-ERCOT Texas
