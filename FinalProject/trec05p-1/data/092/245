I don't think I forwarded this to you earlier, but you might want to take a look.  Doug and Mike get these reports directly.

ERCOT Communications has indicated that many folks are interested in receiving a copy of the October 1 Report and how to get it.  The "REPORT ON EXISTING AND POTENTIAL ELECTRIC SYSTEM CONSTRAINTS AND NEEDS WITHIN THE ERCOT REGION" is available for download at the following Internet address:ftp://ftp.ercot.com/TRANSCONS/transcons.htm  
The ftp (direct download) address is: ftp://ftp.ercot.com/TRANSCONS/ERCOTReportConstraintsNeeds10012001.zip  
It is a zip compressed file containing two MSWord documents and is a little over 1 meg in size.  Depending on your connection, please allow extra time to download it.
Glad to help!  Ken D.
