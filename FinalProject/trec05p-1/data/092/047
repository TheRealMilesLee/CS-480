Sara -

To the extent any revisions being proposed are modifications to the Electronic Trading Agreement for EOL, I need to know what is being proposed.  We do not generally make many, if any, amendments to that agreement.

Do we need to meet briefly about the extent of these EOL amendments?  I'm also thinking of AEP.

Hi Ellen.

Finally I have gotten changes from our Attorney to the EOL Amendment.
Please review our changes and let me know if you have any comments.

Sorry for the delay.

Thanks.
