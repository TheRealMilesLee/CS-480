FROM THE DESK OF MR SALIF

BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)
OUAGADOUGOU,BURKINA FASO.
MY PRIVATE E-MAIL salif4_ali@yahoo.com

Dear Friend,

First, I must solicit your confidence in this
transaction.This is by virtue of its nature as being
utterly CONFIDENTIAL AND TOP SECRET. However after series
of petition was recieved by this present regime from
foreign contractors and inability of the BANK OF AFRICA
(BOA)to fulfill their obligation for the payment to its
foreign creditors, in conjunction with the council of
ministers, they mandated us to carry out a careful and
comprehensive review of all overdue payments to foreign
contractors and to effect payments immediately.

During the above mentioned process, we discovered an
abandoned sum of US$10.M (Ten million US dollars) in an
account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who
died along with his
entire famil in a plane crash that happened in Kenya, East
Africa.

Since we got information about his death, we have been
expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money
because we cannot release it unless some body applies for
it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated
in our banking guidelines and laws but unfortunately we
learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died
alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind
for the claim.

Please I want you to visit the website below for more
information about the Plane Crash:

www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/20/kenya.crash/index.html

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other
officials in my department now decided to make this
business proposal to you and release the money to you as
the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and
subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and
we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as
unclaimed bill.

I agree that 40% of this money will be for you as a foreign
partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign
account,and 50% would be for me, while 10% will be for
expenses incure during the transaction. There after I will
visit your country for disbursement according to the
percentage indicated.

Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to
you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as
relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your
bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone
and fax number for easy and effective communication and
location wherein the money will be remitted.

Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you by email
the text of the application to fill and send to the bank. I
will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction
is hitch-free risk and this transaction will only take us
14 banking days because as a banker, I know what to do and
move the fund into your account without any delay and
thatyou should not entertain any atom of fear as all
required arrangement have been made for the transfer.

You should contact me as soon as you receive this letter so
that I will send you the text of the application to apply
to the bank and the data information of the deceased
customer and you should contact me through this my private
e-mail address: 

salif4_ali@yahoo.com

Yours faithfully.
MR SALIF ALI
Bill & Exchange Manager,
BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)
