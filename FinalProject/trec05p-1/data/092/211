Marie,
	I am forwarding to you the documentation Goldman would require regarding the Assignment and Assumption of the Convertible book from ENA to ECT Investments.  When we initially moved Convertible book from ECT Investments to ENA about a year ago, I believe we created our own legal templates based on the primebroker's documents.  Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.  I am hoping to get this completed by month end.  

Thanks,
Theresa
