What a cutie!  Will I be able to see her in person on the 28th?  You are
welcome to bring her!

Are you still up for next Sunday.  If so....ya'll could plan on coming at
12:30 or so.  We can cook out and also take a tour of the canals on our
little boat if ya'll are up for it and ...... if the weather cooperates.
If Erin isn't ready for her boat rides we can take turns going!

John and I have to go to Memorial City that night for a opening party.
It's casual, but we would need to start getting ready around 4 or so!

What do you think?

Cathy
