	Here's what I've found out from Dennis Lee.  USGT requested a realignment of delivery capacity back in June (it was also sent to them in June).  They held onto the request until a few weeks ago when they signed and returned the amendment.  Dennis found where the capacity was disapproved by Perry Frazier but, for an as yet unknown reason, Michelle Cormier tendered this amendment to them.  The changes have been activated in the TW contract system; however, we have not signed/returned the amendment and they have not nominated these changes.  Dennis says they switch these DP's frequently and would "probably" be agreeable to switch 6,000/d of their capacity (which was suggested by Perry in his denial of capacity) upon our request.  As you're aware, Michelle has changed jobs since this incident and this amendment was tendered prior to our re-implemention of the routing process.  I'll get you the file and associated papers as soon as Dennis has completed his examination. Our Tariff does stipulate that an amendment, not returned within 30 days, is null and void.  Since we did not sign and return the amendment, we could just say it "timed out"...  just a thought.
