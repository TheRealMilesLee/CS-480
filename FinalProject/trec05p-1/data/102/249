John,

Since you seem to be swamped in things that need to be done and I have a strong interest in options trading, I would like to offer any time that I have outside my Gas Structuring obligations to help you with anything that might help make your job easier. I realize some of the tasks may be somewhat mundane but hopefully I will also get a good understanding of how you do your job.

Regards,

cjc
