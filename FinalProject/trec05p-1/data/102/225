Leslie Sara, and Brent:

Could I get an update on were we are with the top 20 customer amendments.  Last week we got 5 amendments for power physical but we still haven't received any amendments for financial.  Entergy-Koch is very interested in ConfirmLogic and have asked for the amendments.  When can we get the amendments for Entergy-Koch completed?

Thanks,
KC
