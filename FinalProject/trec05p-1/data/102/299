Rosie...absolutely!!  I'll make my schedule work.  However, unless this is a personal favor Ken is doing for the gentlemen involved, I'd also be happy to "field" this for him.  I told Ken we(University Affairs/Public Affairs) would not impose on his schedule for these kinds of visits until after January.  Clearly, there are occasions where some of Ken's many friends contact him directly, and , as kind as Ken is, even at extreme times, he agrees.   However, if this is not a personal visit, I'm quite certain this dean is looking for a better financial and recruiting relationship with Enron.  In fact, we are putting together a "master Plan"" financial relationship with UT overall (Rick Causey is the exec lead), and realistically, we are not recruiting engineers per se.  So Rosie my darling friend, let me know if you'd like me to politely intervene and take this off your list, or if this  is one of those personal friendship situations, in which case, I'll be there on the 14th!
 
Thanks and kisses!!
 
--Christie.

Hi Christie - 

Would you be able to join Ken in this meeting?  As you can see, we don't have a lot of information.  If you feel it would be good to talk to John Halton (who will also be attending the meeting with Dean Ben Streetman), he can be reached at 512-471-2120.

Thanks much and take care. 

Rosie

Hi Mr. Dickerson - 

I apologize for the delay in getting back with you.  If it would still be 
convenient for Dean Streetman, Ken Lay can meet with him the morning of 
November 14 - possibly 9:30 a.m. 

Please let me know.

   Ken, 
   Ben Streetman, Dean of the UT School of Engineering, tells me that he 
   will be in Houston on November 14 and would like to meet with you. I 
   realize that your schedule is overflowing these days; however, should 
   time permit, the Dean would sincerely appreciate an opportunity to visit 
   with you for a few minutes. 
   Thank you. 
   Kenneth R. Dickerson
