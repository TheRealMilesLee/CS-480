Hi Carmen, 

The mosquito spray you can get at Lowe's or Home Depo. It's one one those that you just hook up to the end of your hose and turn the knob. I found it works pretty well. Just take a couple days or so to work, It come in a gray jug (it may be an Orhto product but don't bank on my memory). And yes, I am into arts & crafts. I have a d/b/a Bungalow Life and hope to have an e-business one day and a  gallery studio and business out of my bungalow. I am a reader/student (and collector when I can afford it) of most anything from 1900-1920's. Hope to talk to you some time. I am at 906 Bomar.

Chris,

What is the spray that you hook up to your garden hose?
Non-toxic sounds good. Where do you buy it? Thanks!

P.S. Your e-mail address is bungalowlife, are you into arts

I have an electric fogger, Amy, if youwould like to use it. However, i 
must caution that it does use strong chemicals like the County fogger 
trucks. I use it and keep my dog inside for an hour or so until the smell 
dissapates. It has worked wonders. There is also a spray that youjust! hook 
up to you hose and spray your yard, bushes and under your house. It is 
non-toxic and works really well also.
Let me know if you would like to use the fogger.

me this - can you call Harris County Mosquito Control and help me complain? 
I figure that if a whole load of us start calling, they won't be able to 
ignore us. Their number is 713-440-4800.  I get a recording when I call, 
but their hours are 8 - 5, so maybe we can talk to a live person tomorrow. 
Thank! you for helping me, and ultimately helping everyone. Best Regards,
