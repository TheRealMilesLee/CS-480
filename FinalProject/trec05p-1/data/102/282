FROM THE DESK OF MR. HENRY KOFI MENSAH

Phone: +233 24 3331032
Fax: +233 27 621073

Greetings,

My name is Mr. Henry Kofi Mensah. I am the Regional Manager of Barclays
Bank of Ghana, Takoradi branch in the Western Region of Ghana. I write you
this proposal in good faith; I am 42 years old and married with two lovely
children. I am a man of peace, and have sincere respect for human feelings
and opinions. I have packaged a financial transaction that will benefit
you and I. As the Regional Manager of Barclays bank it is my duty to send
in a financial report to my head office in the capital city, Accra at the
end of each business year.

On the course of last year, 2004 business report, I discovered that the
branch in which I am the Manager made Five million eight hundred and fifty
thousand United States Dollars ($5,850,000.00) which my head office is not
aware of and will never be aware of. I have placed this funds on what we
call Escrow call account with no beneficiary. As an officer of this bank I
cannot be directly connected to this money, so my aim of contacting you is
to assist me receive this money in your bank account and get 20% of the
total funds as commission.

There are practically no risks involved, the transaction will be executed
under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of
the law, it will be simply a bank-to-bank transfer, and all I need from
you is to stand claim as the original depositor of these funds who made
the deposit with my branch so that my head office can order the transfer
to your designated bank account under few working days. If you accept to
work with me I will appreciate it very much as you are the first and the
only person I am contacting for this transaction.

My private phone number is +233 243 331032 call me or send me an email as
soon as you receive this message if you think we can work together so that
we can go over the details. Thank you in advance and may God bless you and
your family.

Sincerely,

Henry K. Mensah
