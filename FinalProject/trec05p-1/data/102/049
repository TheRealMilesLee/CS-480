Andy & Jeff:

We have scheduled a conference call on Oct. 30 (Tuesday) at 3:00 p.m. with the Judge to discuss setting the motion to transfer for hearing and our request that oral testimony be allowed.  TDC will oppose this request.  If the request is granted, they will ask to depose anyone who is called.  Frankly, if they do not need further discovery to prepare a reply, I don't understand why they would need discovery to have a hearing.  Nonetheless, the judge will make that call.

Andy, I don't believe you need to be on the call (although you are certainly welcome), but since Nelson is our likely witness, please find out if any days in Nov. are particulary bad.  Be aware that a possible hearing day is Nov. 21, the day before Thanksgiving.  Let me know if you want to be on the call with the Court.

Jeff, I will plan on patching you in unless you are not available or do not think you should be on the call.

Robert
