So far I have talked to everyone but Heather. As I mentioned Nick was much better than I anticipated. He said things were a little slower than he was expecting but nothing else. The point I wanted to get across to him was to take the initiative in working with Jeff and getting more involved within our group.

Fran was a little unusual. She was concerned about having to wait each morning before running liquidations because we are not flat and she felt that it was a bad reflection on the group if we reported late. She was also concerned about the Enpower QandA meeting and why none of the West issues had been taken care of that have been sitting there for a couple of months. She also couldn't understand why it mentioning your name before they would take the index option out of the PCS. She just wished that if Bill Crooks required your approval then he should say so. Finally, while she has seen some improvement with Heather, she is still a little unhappy with her. She feels that Heather is not doing her part in helping with the day to day routines enough, disappears for a while,etc. I told her that I would talk to Bill about the status of our projects, that we need to run liquidations by 9 each morning no matter what and I will address the issue with Bill Williams and Tim only if necessary. Heather's issues I was going to address anyway, so we will see how that goes. I did tell Fran that she has really stepped up and become a "lead" in this group and that she is doing an outstanding job. I also mentioned to her that I talked to you about the work status thing and she was very grateful for that. I asked what her long term goals were and she thought at some point about getting into structuring and maybe doing that in Houston! I was surprised by that comment.


Sam's went fairly well. Her only concern was regarding team spirit. Not what I thought it meant thought. She really means interaction between people, so I have suggested that we go more regular meeting depending on what projects are going on within the group. She also is comparing herself to Fran and the learning curve. She wanted to know how she could learn more like what Fran has done. The only thing that I see as different between the two is that Fran has been heavily involved with the index and Asian options. I recommended that Sam take on some of these "testing duties" and she was happy about that.
