Louise,

As I am sure you are aware, our current plans on Fort Pierce include going back to FPUA and being honest with them (i.e. letting them know that the transaction as currently structured is not likely to proceed).  The goal of our meeting with FPUA is to be both fair and honest and to provide them with the opportunity to make the project more feasible by making economic concessions.  One concern that I have heard is that FPUA may incorrectly assume that our visit has little to do with the reason mentioned above and more to do with Enron's recent troubles.  Because FPUA is a municipal entity and this project has been closely followed by the media, this discussion is likely to make it into the newspapers and any conclusions reached by FPUA may be announced for all the world to see.  Do you have any suggestions for how this situation should be handled?  Should Eric Thode be consulted?

Stuart
