'On-line Exchanges Evolve'
-------------------------
Entering the new millennium, energy companies are being forced to do business in new ways. Tough environmental legislation, product price sensitivity, mergers and acquisitions, downsizing, supply shortages, and profitability pressures all pose significant challenges to the energy industry as a whole. However, nothing poses more of a challenge than the Internet revolution.

2002 Catalog - hot off the press! 
------------------------------
Our 2002 Catalog has just been published and is in the mail now. It's never too early to start planning next years training...

New industry basics web-based training 
** Introduction to the Power Industry **
Electricity is the power we all rely on. Learn how the power gets to you. Meg O'Watt, utility spokesperson, is ready to explain the mysteries of electricity and the basics of the power industry so you'll appreciate what happens when you flip the switch. Join Meg in "Introduction to the Power Industry".

** An Overview of the Natural Gas Industry **
We have a special pass for you to visit The Museum of Natural Gas and see how natural gas is produced and marketed. We've even arranged our top museum guide, Bea T. Yu, to show you through the museum and introduce you to the natural gas industry. There are lots of exciting exhibits that take you from the formation of natural gas through processing and transmission to end-users. See how natural gas is traded in markets around the world.
