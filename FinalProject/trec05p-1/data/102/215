PLEASE READ IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN A SUMMER INTERNSHIP


If you are in your first year or second year of the program you are eligible to participate in summer 2002 internship opportunities.  You can only participate once. Please send me an email ASAP and no later than Sunday night 10/28 if you are interested? I will provide you with additional information on Monday as to what to do next.  As stated in previous publications, you will face issues of conflict of interest and possibly having to quit or be on a leave from your job to be eligible to intern.  Just an FYI.

Thanks,
