I am sorry to bother you and if this is not your responsibility could you
please forward to the appropriate person.



I am a computer security consultant searching for companies and
organizations currently facing spyware and other resource stealing issues.
Over the past years spyware, adware, malware, virus' and many other threats
have cost organizations thousands of dollars in labor cost to maintain
computer systems.  The company I am representing manufactures software that
completely eliminates these issues from any computer, regardless of the
system (Mac and or PC).



In an attempt to broaden our market placement we are currently seeking
willing participants in a free evaluation of this amazing software in their
environments.  We will provide you with numerous free copies (quantity based
on total computers) of the software in order to determine the effectiveness
of the software in environments that face these threats.  We will also
provide you with the network control tool to remotely manage these licenses.



To take advantage of this limited free offer simply reply to this e-mail or
give me a call, and we will set up the best time to evaluate your systems
and which version of the software would best suit your environment.  In
order to evaluate your systems needs, I only need to ask a few questions.
The questions have to do with your operating systems and the process' you
use to maintain your computers.



As an indication of the success that the software has had thus far I would
like to let you know of a couple of well known companies that currently
utilize the solutions.  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation placed these
solutions on every computer that they gave away.  Apple placed the solutions
on every Mac in every retail store worldwide.



Again, these are free licenses that cost you nothing but a conversation as
to how the software performs for you.



I thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide.
