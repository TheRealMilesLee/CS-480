I am the chairman of the contract award committee of the 
petroluem and natural resources ministry here in Nigeria, for 
security reasons, I may not wish to disclose how I got your 
email address for now.

After due deliberation with my partner, I decided to forward 
to you this business proposal.We want you to assist us 
receive the sum of 
Twenty eight million, six hundred thousand united state bills
(us28.6m) into your account. This fund resulted from an 
over-invoiced contract awarded by us under the budget 
allocation to my ministry and the bill was approved for 
payment by the concerned ministries. The contract was 
executed, commissioned and the contractor was paid his actual 
cost of the contract. Now, we are left with the balance of 
us28.6m as the over invoiced amount, which we have 
deliberately over estimated for our own use. Please note that 
the law forbids civil servants to operate or own foreign 
accounts hence this contact, we have agreed to share the 
money in the following percentages: 30 for you, 60 for us 10 
for tax as may be required by your government.

Note that this transaction is very much free from all sorts 
of risk hence the business was carefully planned before it 
was successfully executed and we the officials involved in 
the deal have put many years in service to our ministry. We 
have been exercising patience for this privilege for so long 
not until the presidential announcement last week, that all 
foreign contractors owed be paid forthwith, this will enable 
the presidency reconcile our debt ratio with the outside 
world and to most of us, this is a lifetime blessing we 
cannot afford to miss. Upon indication of your interest to 
fully co-operate with us, a payment application/information 
form will be sent to you via email for completion. 

Note that the following information: a) bankers name and 
address, b) account number and account name and c) your 
private phone number and email address will enable us 
seek/secure approval of the fund from the concerned 
government quarters/ministries within 3-4 banking days. 

As soon as we confirm receipt of this money in your nominated 
bank account, my partner and I will come over to your country 
to arrange for our own share and possibly invest part of this 
money in your country.

Let honesty and trust be our watchword throughout this 
transaction. I shall furnish you with some details about 
myself. Your prompt reply will be highly appreciated.  

Best regards.

Engr. Michaels. I. S. A
