Dear Board Members and Attendees,

Attached please find additional supplemental materials provided for the 
Retail Electric Quadrant discussions during the meeting on March 7.  The 
materials are in .pdf format, bookmarked for access to separate documents.  
The materials include the presentation by Mr. Driggs to the Board of 
Directors on March 7, the retail electric quadrant (REQ) procedures as a 
NAESB Bylaw Addendum, a revised letter regarding the request for promotional 
dues (the revisions are noted in redline from the document contained in the 
Board Book), and a list of issues requiring clarification.  

The ballot is contained in the board book under tab 8 for the adoption of the 
REQ procedures and the adoption of the promotional dues request, for Board 
members unable to attend the meeting.  The board book can be found on our web 
site (http://www.naesb.org/bod.htm), and was also provided in paper form for 
the Board members.  If you need additional information or experience 
difficulty downloading the attached file, please call the NAESB office at
