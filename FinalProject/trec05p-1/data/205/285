Hello, Everyone - 
 
This notice confirms the RTO West clarification/review session this Friday, January 25, 2002, at the Kingstad Conference Center first floor meeting room.  The Kingstad Conference Center is located at 5933 NE Win Sivers Drive, about three miles east of the Portland Airport.  The meeting will begin at 8:30 a.m. PST and end around 2:00 p.m.
 
The purpose of the meeting is to "walk through" rough draft write-ups of the Scheduling Coordinator Agreement and Paying Agent Agreement.  We will also review draft revisions to the RTO West Bylaws and the draft revised Pricing Proposal.  Final draft revisions to Planning and Market Monitoring will be explained.  Questions and input will be taken on all these proposed documents.
 
The draft TOA will not be ready for the January 25th meeting.  If there is interest in holding a meeting to present and clarify the TOA, we will discuss options for this meeting with you on Friday.  At the January 25th meeting, we will also provide an update to the schedule for completing filing documents. (So far, RTO RRG days are still scheduled for 2/11 and 2/12/02.)   
 
Preliminary drafts of the Scheduling Coordinator Agreement and Appendix and the Paying Agent Agreements were posted on the RTO West website at <http://www.rtowest.org/Stage2RRG_Upcoming.htm> .  Drafts of the Bylaws and the Pricing Proposal revisions will be posted by tomorrow.  We will send a notice to you when they are available on the website.
 
The topics that will be covered Friday are:
- Update on Schedule to Complete Filing Documents,
- Draft Scheduling Coordinator Agreement and Appendix,
- Draft Paying Agent Agreement,
- Draft Revisions to Pricing Proposal,
- Draft Revisions to RTO West Bylaws,
- Draft Final Revisions to Planning Proposal,
- Draft Final Revisions to Market Monitoring Proposal.
