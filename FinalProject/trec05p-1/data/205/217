Vince,

I have never had a chance to formally meet you but many people have said that you would be a wonderful person to talk to seek advice from.  I have a couple of directions that I am considering for careers right now (in risk management) and it would mean a lot to me to be able to sit down with you for a little bit to get your perspective.  Is there anyway I could buy you coffee or lunch sometime over the week or so?

Thanks,
Jason Jennaro
