Give me your opinion on Tim Belden's issue below please.  

Schedule 27.4 lists power fundamentals applications and the CLA says that the Enron Parties are licensing it to UBS.  I also talked with Bob Hillier on this and he agreed with me and said that the Enron Parties own everything and the schedule lists what we are licensing to UBS.  West Power Fundamentals was developed by the Enron Parties and is owned by the Enron Parties.

Let me know your thoughts.

Hi Beth,
I hate to be uncooperative, particularly after all that we have accomplished together, but I can't see where in the Enron/UBS agreement it says that Enron needs or gets to keep the West Power Fundamentals system.  Furthermore, I have no assurances that Enron is in a position to keep this information confidential as Richard Schweiger is rightfully looking for a new job.  Richard could easily understand what we are doing and use it to secure a job with AEP, Pacificorp or someone else here in town.  I don't mean to question Richard's integrity, but these are very strange times.

Until I receive word from UBS or Greg Whalley I am sitting tight.

Again, sorry to be uncooperative, but it doesn't appear to me that our interests are aligned right now and I need to protect our competitive advantage.

Regards,
Tim

All,

I have been requested to obtain a working copy of all fundamental systems.  The estate wants to preserve them and they should be available for use within the estate.

I will dedicate systems resources to working with your groups.  Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

I will have Richard Burchfield coordinate these efforts.  Richard Schweiger will assist us in Portland.

Thanks,
Beth
