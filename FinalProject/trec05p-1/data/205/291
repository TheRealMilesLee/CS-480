In response to the message about the burgluries, I would like to say 
that there has been a tremendous increase in this activity over the 
past couple years.  Lorraine and I experienced our first such event 
last winter when a heavily tatooed man broke into our home in broad 
daylight to steal our bicicles, precious jewelry and other items. We 
have 2 dogs that bark at everything but they did not deter this man 
as he paid no mind to them.

A few weeks ago there were 3 or 4 car break-ins on Taft Street but I 
don't think any of these were reported to the police.

We had mentioned this at previous meetings but would just like to 
remind everyone to keep their eyes open and call the police if you 
see anything suspicous at all.  As more and more new people move into 
town, the chance of being burglured will increase.  The policewoman 
that responded to our call said that our area is a target for theft.  
I don't think there is any reason to panic or consider moving to the 
burbs, it is just a fact of life that these crimes will occur.  We 
all need to act as one and watch out for each other.

When I first moved here back in 1994 I remember talking to a guy whom 
I think was the president of EMCA at the time (can't remember his 
name, but he lived accross the street from me) Him and his wife moved 
to Russia or something.  Anyway, there was a neighborhood watch 
program in affect where people took turns driving and walking the 
neighborhood.  Is there anything like this going on now?  Just 
wondering.
