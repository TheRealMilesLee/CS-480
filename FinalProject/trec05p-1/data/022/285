PacifiCorp Real-Time has recently been requested several times by PSE's to use their "Adjust" function for changing schedules.  This has prompted them to ask for a clarification on the Adjust function "rules".  It is Real-Times belief that the Adjust function is for Control Area use and only for Reliability/Curtailment issues.  If Merchants/PSE's want to change a schedule on an existing tag it should be done through the Termination/replaced functions at their control and not ask C/A's to use their Adjust function.  I have found documentation that tells who has control of the Adjust function and how it can be used but cannot find any documentation that specifically prohibits or limits it's use to C/A and/or their curtailment issues.  Does anybody have any help here??  The main issue is, R/T does not have time to perform adjust functions for other entities merely at their request.   We can understand doing it when the tag originator has lost control and is unable to terminate a tag but not on a routine basis.
