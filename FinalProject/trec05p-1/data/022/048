Dear,

Listen and listen good..
Keep this mail and information very confidential.

I am the new Information and Database analyst of the Treasury/Payment Inv=
estigation
Department of the Central Bank of Nigeria.

I'm contacting you to stop you from any further contact with anybody what=
soever.This
is because your fund is no longer in the previous bank where it was depos=
ited.It
is now in the suspense account of Central Bank of Nigeria within my payme=
nt
desk.All the people you are contacting both your representing attorney an=
d
others are planning to use your good name and claim the fund against you.=


Even as I'm writing to you now,I'm the only recognized person you can ens=
ure
the transfer of the fund to your account as the chief database analyst.No=
ne
of those people you are presently contacting have the legal right or auth=
ority
to effect the transfer of the fund to your account.
I have decided to contact you through this medium because in my further
investigation,I found out that your claim is genuine with all legal backi=
ngs
apart from the above data irregularities and complications.

Therefore, I've withdrawn my submission paper for conversion of the funds=

to the CBN Treasury, which several payments have suffered because of thes=
e
fraud irregularities.

I therefore contacted you on trust and with complete confidence that you
should as a matter of ulmost importance, STOP any further contact with an=
ybody,person
or group including your so-called local attorney because apart from me,no=

other person can help you get the fund transfered to your account in your=

country.

REQUIREMENTS:
I want you to contact me upon reciept of this mail on 234 803 740 5020 so=

that I would guide you on how to get your fund directly transfered to you=
r
own norminated account at ease.

I will personally get the above complications corrected at my own expense=

as soon as possible so that legal transfer of the fund to your account wo=
uld
commence.

I can assure you that after the corrections,within 72 hours the fund must=

be in your designated account.

I will oblige you with further information and would be glad you send you=
r
private telephone /facsimile number for easy and confidential communicati=
on.

MY CONDITIONS:
1.After using my good office/position to accomplish the needful on your
behalf,you shall give me 35% only of the total fund after transfer to you=
r
account.

2.Due to my position in government,I will prefer that you keep my involve=
ment
100% secret and confidential even after the transfer is executed.

A stitch in time they say saves nine.This is the only reliable channel fo=
r
you otherwise all other efforts MUST be in vain.
