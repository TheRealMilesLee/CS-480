8 Del. C. § 145 (2001) 
§ 145. Indemnification of officers, directors, employees and agents; insurance 


(a) A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the person's conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that the person's conduct was unlawful. 

(b) A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. 

(c) To the extent that a present or former director or officer of a corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. 

(d) Any indemnification under subsections (a) and (b) of this section (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because the person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (1) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (2) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders. 

(e) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an officer or director in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this section. Such expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems appropriate. 

(f) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other subsections of this section shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. 

(g) A corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under this section. 

(h) For purposes of this section, references to "the corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this section with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. 

(i) For purposes of this section, references to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the corporation" as referred to in this section. 

(j) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this section shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. 

(k) The Court of Chancery is hereby vested with exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all actions for advancement of expenses or indemnification brought under this section or under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. The Court of Chancery may summarily determine a corporation's obligation to advance expenses (including attorneys' fees).

NOTES: 
REVISOR'S NOTE. --Section 30 of 67 Del. Laws, c. 376, provides: "This act shall become effective on July 1, 1990." Chapter 376 was signed by the Governor on July 17, 1990. 
Section 3 of 69 Del. Laws, c. 261, provides: "This act shall become effective July 1, 1994, and shall not apply to suits pending as of July 1, 1994." 
Section 32 of 71 Del. Laws, c. 120, provides: "This act shall be effective on July 1, 1997, except that § 5 of this act shall become effective with respect to indemnification of expenses (including attorneys' fees) for acts or omissions occurring on or after July 1, 1997." 

EFFECT OF AMENDMENTS. --67 Del. Laws, c. 376, in (e), inserted "(including attorneys' fees)" in the first and second sentences and substituted "any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative" for "a civil or criminal" in the first sentence. 
69 Del. Laws, c. 261, effective July 1, 1994, rewrote the second sentence in (d); and added (k). 
71 Del. Laws, c. 120, neutralized gender-specific language in (c), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i); in (c), substituted "present or former director or officer" for "director, officer, employee or agent"; in (d), inserted "present or former" in the first sentence and rewrote the second sentence; and, in the second sentence in (e), inserted "former directors and officers or" and substituted "corporation" for "board of directors." 

PURPOSE OF INDEMNIFICATION STATUTES. --Indemnification statutes were enacted in this State, and elsewhere, to induce capable and responsible businessmen to accept positions in corporate management.

Subsection (a) of this section does not oblige Delaware corporations to indemnify those who serve other enterprises at their request; if a corporation wishes not to extend indemnification rights to those who serve elsewhere at its request, it can say so in its bylaws, or it can say nothing at all, thereby achieving the same result.

FEES DEDUCTED FROM AWARD. --Where the initial purchase of stock represented usurpation of a corporate opportunity, the Court of Chancery properly deducted attorney's fees and past payments from the amounts to be paid to a corporate shareholder for the repurchase of the stock.

RECOVERY OF EXPENSES OF PROXY CONTEST, COUCHED IN TERMS OF BOARD ELECTION, INVOLVING SUBSTANTIVE DIFFERENCES ABOUT CORPORATE POLICY. --Where a proxy contest, though couched in terms of election to the board, was actually one involving substantive differences about corporation policy, former corporate directors, determined to be the management group for the purposes of reelection to the board and, therefore, entitled to use corporate funds to present its position, had an equitable and legal right to recover from the corporation their reasonable expenses resulting from the proxy contest.

EXPENSES INCURRED IN ESTABLISHING ENTITLEMENT TO INDEMNIFICATION. --This section allows for indemnification of legal fees only in the underlying action against an officer or director, and does not allow for recovery of legal fees and expenses incurred in a proceeding to establish an entitlement to such indemnification.

OFFICERS AS CORPORATE EMPLOYEES. --A corporate officer is not, as a matter of law, also a corporate employee merely by virtue of office; whether a corporate officer is also an employee depends on the incidents of the relationship to the corporation.

FORMER DIRECTORS HELD ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION FOR LEGAL FEES RELATIVE TO UNSUCCESSFUL REELECTION BID. --Former corporate directors were entitled to indemnification for legal fees and related costs incurred with respect to suits filed by them in their unsuccessful bid for reelection to the corporation's board where the pertinent corporation bylaw contained no limitation on the type of action for which an individual, otherwise qualified under the bylaw, must be indemnified and where indemnification would be consistent with subsections (a) and (b) of this section. Hibbert v. Hollywood Park, Inc., Del. Supr., 457 A.2d 339 (1983). </research/buttonTFLink?_m=e9aa1ac1445d75454922819368e9e384&_xfercite=%3ccite%20cc%3d%22USA%22%3e%3c%21%5bCDATA%5b8%20Del.%20C.%20%a7%20145%20%5d%5d%3e%3c%2fcite%3e&_butType=3&_butStat=242&_butNum=42&_butInline=1&_butinfo=%3ccite%20cc%3d%22USA%22%3e%3c%21%5bCDATA%5b457%20A.2d%20339%5d%5d%3e%3c%2fcite%3e&_fmtstr=FULL&docnum=4&_startdoc=1&_startchk=1&wchp=dGLSzS-lSlWk&_md5=392b602f1875ecc021ee27ab53df148f> 

WITHOUT INTEREST ON EXPENSES ACTUALLY PAID, INDEMNIFICATION WOULD BE INCOMPLETE. Merritt-Chapman & Scott Corp. v. Wolfson, Del. Super.

THERE ARE SEVERAL FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN INDEMNIFICATION FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES: (a) The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service competently, (b) the likelihood that a particular retainer will preclude other employment by the attorney, (c) the fee customarily charged in the community for similar services, (d) the amount involved in the litigation and the results obtained, (e) the time limitations imposed by the litigation, (f) the nature and length of professional relationship with the client, (g) the experience, reputation and ability of the lawyer performing the services, and (h) a consideration whether the fee is fixed or contingent. Galdi v. Berg, 359 F. Supp. 698 (D. Del. 1973). </research/buttonTFLink?_m=e9aa1ac1445d75454922819368e9e384&_xfercite=%3ccite%20cc%3d%22USA%22%3e%3c%21%5bCDATA%5b8%20Del.%20C.%20%a7%20145%20%5d%5d%3e%3c%2fcite%3e&_butType=3&_butStat=242&_butNum=44&_butInline=1&_butinfo=%3ccite%20cc%3d%22USA%22%3e%3c%21%5bCDATA%5b359%20F.%20Supp.%20698%5d%5d%3e%3c%2fcite%3e&_fmtstr=FULL&docnum=4&_startdoc=1&_startchk=1&wchp=dGLSzS-lSlWk&_md5=0b7d8e7ea3d96e74d1a269c3b233dc90>
