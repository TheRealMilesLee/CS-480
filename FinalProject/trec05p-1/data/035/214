ATTN:C.E.O,
I know that this message will come to you as a surprise
since we don?t know each other before, but for purpose of
introduction, I am MR.frank zuma, the Bank Manager of
AMALGAMATED BANK OF SOUTH
AFRICA(ABSA)

There is an account opened in this bank in 1980 and since
1991 nobody has operated on this account again, after going
through some old files in the records, I discovered that if
I do not remit this money out urgently it would be
forfeited for nothing. The owner of the account is Mr.ANDY
T. JOHNSON,a foreigner and a miner at Kruger gold co. a
geologist by profession and he died since 1990. No other
person knows about this account or any thing concerning
it,the account has no other beneficiary and my
investigation proved to me as well that his company does
not know anything about this account and the amount involed
is(USD 26M)twenty six million united states dollars.

I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money
cannot be approved to a local bank here, but can only be
approved to any foreign account because the money is in us
dollars and the former owner of the account is Mr. ANDY T.
JOHNSON is a foreigner too. I know that this message will
come to you as a surprise as we don't know ourselves
before. We will sign an agreement, but be sure that it is
real and a genuinebusiness.

Please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next
step to take immediately. Send also your private telephone
and fax number including the full details of the account to
be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face to face or
sign a binding agreement to bind us together so that you
can receive this money into a foreign account or any
account of your choice wherethe fund will be safe.

And I will fly to your country for withdrawal and sharing
and other investments. I need your full co-operation to
make this work fine because the management is ready to
approve this payment to any foreigner, who has correct
information of this account, which I will give to you later
immediately, if you are capable and willing to handle such
amount in strict confidence and trust according to my
instructions and advice for our mutual benefit because this
opportunity may never come again in my life. I need
truthful person in this business because I don't want to
make mistake I need your strong assurance andtrust.

With my position now in the office I can transfer this
money to any foreigner's reliable account, which you can
provide with assurance that this money will be intact
pending my physical arrival in your country for sharing. I
will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we
receive this money leaving no trace to any place. You can
also come to discuss with me face to face after which I
will make this remittance in your presence and two of us
will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the
money going into the account. I will apply for annual leave
to get visa immediately I hear from you that you are ready
to act and receive this fund in your account.

I will use my position and influence to effect legal
approvals and onward transfer of this money to your
naccount with appropriate clearance forms of the ministries
and foreign exchange departments. At the conclusion of this
business, you will be given 30% of the total amount, 65%
will be for me, and while 5% will be for expenses both
parties might have incurred during the process of
transferring. 

I look forward to your 
earliest reply through 
my email.Alternative Email
