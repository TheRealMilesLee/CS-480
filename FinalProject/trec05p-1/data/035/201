Howdy Miss Kim,

Bet you can wait to say Ariva Derchi and see Italy?  Where abouts are you
going?  Two of my sisters went to Northern Italy a year ago and had a great
time.

We had rain everyday in Scotland, but it was still so beautiful.  One night
we stayed on the coast of the Irish Sea and saw there was a ferry about a
half-a-block down the street so checked out where we could go.  Ended up
taking a high speed ferry across the Irish Sea to Larne and did a day trip
of the Irish Coast.  Fantastic.

We did a small cruise boat on Loch Ness, a tour bus, a double decker bus,
the train, the ferry and the tube!  The second to the last day we drove to
Gatwick, drop the car in short term parking and got a student pass  (must
look younger than we thought) and took the train to Victoria Station.
Walked over to Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park and Piccadilly Circus.  Took the
underground to the Tower.  Hadn't been there since 1972 (probably the year
you were born).  They have cleaned the entire outside of the tower and it
looks fabulous.  All the displays have been reworked and everything was so
interesting.  Could easily have spent an entire day there.

We're coming down the end of November for Mr. Matt's 1st birthday.  Mark,
Michelle and Matt are arriving Aug 29 and leaving Sept 2.  We did get to see
them on our layover on the way back from England.  They met us at the
airport and we went to Pappasitos.  Nothing like being up 20 hours and
eating chips and salsa.

Have a wonderful time.

Take care - hugs,

M
