FYI

This is a presentation I went to last week lead by Elliot Mainzer (Portland office) who is working with a team of people to establish a centralized Renewables book.  The attached presentation has some good information on the Renewables market, and their group is available to support our transactions as needed.	  Just something to keep in mind.

Thank you very much for attending the Renewable Power Meeting in Houston last week. I hope I was able to convey a sense of the opportunities across the country. I will be circling back with you over the next several weeks to discuss some specific transactions and to solicit recommendations for ways in which our groups can best collaborate. I have attached the PowerPoint slides from the meeting.

Best wishes,

Elliot Mainzer
