I'm not sure if you can help me with this, but I don't know who else to ask.  For April and May, we have gas pathed on deal 133304 to Conoco at the GEPL Big Cowboy point.  Conoco is saying that we did not buy that gas from them.  They have accounted for all of the HPL Big Cowboy gas and think we have over paid by about $1.5 mil each month for the GEPL gas.  Do you know why we added the GEPL meter to the deal in April?  Could we have bought this gas from someone else?  I have the meter statements from Tejas, but they do not say who the supply company was.
