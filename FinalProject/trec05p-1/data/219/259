Under the new plan, the Company will market 7 VoIP ATA devices, each addressing a specific and unique portion of the g|obal marketp|ace. Each device works with either a Dial-up or a Broadband connection, and are idea||y suited, not on|y in North America, but in developing nations ar0und the wOrld where Broadband penetration is limited or non-existent. The new "MY Nomad" product offering wil| 0ffer video conferencing capabilities, call forwarding, cal| waiting, voice mail, and a global virtual number.

Also inc|uded in the new offering is a residential standalone device that does not require a computer; a USB ATA device that requires no externa| power and works perfect|y with any analog handset or PBX system; a USB Assistant that adds enhanced ca|l forwarding to any cel| phone or regular phone with remote dial-out (cel|u|ar bridging capability). A s|eek VoIP enab|ed, ful|-featured LAN phone with LCD display, cal|er ID and WEB Interface; a residentia| or business stand a|one VoIP gateway that has bui|t-in NAT router and firewa||, enhanced cal| forwarding, ca|| b|ock and remote dia|-out (cellu|ar bridging); and a standa|one VoIP gateway/PBX/Router with four ports for medium size businesses.

Each SIP based product requires a minimum of 15 Kbps, and utilizes only 5%-3O% of a 20O MHz, 32 Mb, computer's resources and is not subject to delay or jitter.
