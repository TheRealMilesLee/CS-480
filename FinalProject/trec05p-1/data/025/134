Dear Sir, 
 
I am Dieter Plaumann and I represent Mr. Mikhail
Khordokovsky the former C.E.O of Yukos Oil Company in
Russia. I have a very sensitive and confidential brief
from this top (oligarch) to ask for your partnership
in re-profiling funds over US$450 million. I will give
the details, but in summary, the funds are coming via
Bank Menatep. This is a legitimate transaction. You
will be paid 4% for your "management fees".
 
If you are interested, please write back by email;
d.plaumann@virgilio.it and provide me with your
confidential telephone number, fax number and email
address and I will provide further details and
instructions. Please keep this confidential; we can’t
afford more political problems. Finally, please note
that this must be concluded within two weeks. Please
write back promptly.
Write me back. I look forward to it.
Regards
 
D. Plaumann.
