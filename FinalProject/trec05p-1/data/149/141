Developing Value-Focused Financial Strategies – Hyperion Webcast
*** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ***

What drives the value of a publicly-held company – Revenue growth?  Market share?  
Profitability?  Over the past 12 – 18 months it seems that the financial markets have 
been focusing more on profitability as the main measure of corporate value.  But do 
today’s financial statements really reflect the true value of a company? 

Please join us for this free one-hour webcast, sponsored by Hyperion, which will focus 
on techniques for developing Value-Focused Financial Strategies.  Featured on the 
agenda will be Dr. Robert Howell, visiting professor at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of 
Business, who will suggest how financial reporting can be significantly improved so that 
investors, creditors and other stakeholders may find them more useful in making rational 
investment, credit and similar decisions.  Dr. Howell will elaborate on his views about 
driving business value based on “free cash flow” – views which have been published in 
a series of articles in Fortune Magazine.   Then hear from Hyperion how a unified 
approach to Financial Management can enable improved financial reporting, enhanced 
decision-making and the implementation of value-focused financial strategies.

Your questions will be answered during a live, interactive, Q&A session, giving you 
the opportunity to make specific inquiries pertaining to your organization.
