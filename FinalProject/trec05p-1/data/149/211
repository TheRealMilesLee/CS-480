We continue to analyze any rights that Citi or B of A may have to offset against monies on deposit with them.  We are looking into the prepays further (additional info  obtained today indicates that we continue to have significant outstanding prepays with Citi), other financing arrangements, trading contracts and account agreements with the banks. We will have all of the pieces pulled together this afternoon.   Regards,   Julia

As requested, we reviewed the Chase prepays to determine ratings trigger events. Upon a downgrade by S&P below investment grade, the collateral threshold under the margin agreement would be reduced from $10MM to zero. There is no Moody's downgrade trigger. In addition, Mary Perkins has advised that we do not have monies on deposit with Chase.  We are told that there are no outstanding Citibank prepays.
