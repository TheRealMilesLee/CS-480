Please read the attached order my summary and suggested comments for EPMI to the Section 206 case.  (Thanks to Sara and Susan L. for info on these cases).  I prepared it before I got Sam Behrend's "analysis.doc"
 << File: EL01-118-000_1.pdf >>  << File: EPMI Comments in EL01-118-000.doc >> 
We should talk soon to formalize EPMI's position given the short notice for comments.  Christi, per our call earlier today, can you set up a call?   Should we involve Elizabeth Sager or other folks from the Legal Dept?

 I am available all day today (Monday).  On Tuesday, I am available for an hour begginning at 9 a.m. CST.   On wednesday, I am available from 9-10:30 CST and after 2 p.m. CST.

For more background here is Sam B's analysis:
