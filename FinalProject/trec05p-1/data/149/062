Glad to hear it.  I was out all last week also.

By the way, is Sarah still making those wonderful cookies with all the
"goodies" in them?  The one that is the "family recipe"?  I was talking to
a girl at Koch today who said somebody brought in some cookies that had
Snickers bars in them and it made me think of those cookies that Sarah used
to make for us.  And then you sent me an e-mail..........we must be on the
same wavelength!  Anyway, I'm catching up also........working for a living
really sucks!  See ya.

Debbie,

I can't remember if I responded to you....I took vacation all last week.

Things are fine in my little corner (as good as can be expected).  A bit
sad for a lot of other people around here.

As soon as I get caught up, I'll give you a call.

Mark
