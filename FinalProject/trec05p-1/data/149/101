Boys,  
I am bored today and have proof to show you... 
Go to this website and type in 1031 in the sale number field..
It's a beauty and would be a fine addition to any collector's gallery.
I would consider a joint venture with you for investment purposes on this
find of a lifetime.
Personally, I think it looks a little like a late 70's drummer but it is the
Great One nonetheless. 
It is a fine specimen of the era ' Short on the sides, but keep the length
in the back'

PS- the price is about 25,000 swedish kroners which i think is about $5000
