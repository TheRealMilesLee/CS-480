For just the posting of a memo, probably so.  Most of these infractions are not maliciously posted.

Michelle,
 
Below is a draft discipline letter for your approval.  It is intended to be used with employees who are determined to be posting to web-based bulleting boards during company hours.
 
You approved this a year or so ago, but I wanted to run it by you again in case anything has changed.

NAME,

An investigation has determined that you have participated in discussions on web-based bulletin boards during working hours.  Your comments, posted using company equipment and using a name intended to hide your identity, concerned Enron issues that could possibly be construed as insider information.  This activity is in direct violation of Enron's Code of Ethics. 

You are to immediately cease this activity and come into compliance with Enron's Code of Ethics. Repeated violations will subject you to further discipline, up to and including termination.
