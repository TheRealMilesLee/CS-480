Deer All:

Keith, great looking buck! Chris, I can't believe you passed that deer up. 
Very generous.

Chad shot a nice 10 point. Very impressive hunt. He hunted boneyard in the 
morning, then hopped the fence into the robertson pasture and rattled the 
deer withing 10 yards or so and managed to connect on a running shot as the 
deer bolted away.

I fed my Python a gobbler at LoneStar. Then shot a solid schlocho at the 
Hole sunday morning.

Pictures forthcoming.

Joe's beginner's honeymoon has come to an end. He saw nothing decent 
everywhere he went.

Brian saw an impressive young 9 pt at booger. Jim videotaped it the next 
morning. 21" wide or so, short tines. Very tempting deer, but all agreed 
that it was 4.5 and should go another year.

Dogs could not find Jim's deer. Dogs headed from last blood due south to 
fence at highway.

Feeders are all in good shape, except Boneyard. It is running at 7 and 4:30. 
But weak. Chris indicated it needed a bigger battery. We considered putting 
a magnum on it, but if all it needs is a new battery, we'll leave it to you. 
We should get it running well, lots of deer in that area. One good schlocho 
and a bladed spike that needs to be shot. I put a new battery in Lonestar 
and we filled it up. Booger topped off with motor run time increased. 30-30 
was empty. We filled it up. Pig filled up an run time increased. We have 
lots of corn, so if a feeder is not dropping lots of corn, turn up the spin 
time and keep em full. Dropping extra corn also worked well at mesquite and 
showtime..
Mertz will feed protien next week. I consulted with Chris and houston boys 
openning weekend regarding mertz offer to let us buy extra protien this 
fall, since he had met the quota. We agreed to see what he would feed but 
cap it at $500, spread across the board.

Looks like Houston boys will be retruning December 15th weekend and closing 
weekend. I'll be bringing Henry on next trip and think it would be great if 
Keitha nd boys would be there too.

Hope Keith and Jim can make it back as soon as possible. We winterized 
trailer on way out. Keg almost empty.
