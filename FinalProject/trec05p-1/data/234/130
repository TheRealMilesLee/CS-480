I'm not sure Sheila is the one for sign off.
Also, I'm not sure we have our act together.
We need to do that before the draft goes out.
I am especially concerned about the suggested tolerances.
Given our recent discussions, they may be too low.
If anything, it seems like they are less then the recent Shelley/Mike guidelines.
(Maybe we need some more "official" guidelines.)
If Trunkline sees these numbers, it may be hard to change the tolerances.
Finally, Shelley and Mike may be concerned if we sent it out without their comments.
I will continue to press for input.

Why can't we just get Sheila's signoff.    It isn't like we are doing anything radical here.   Trunkline hasn't even seen it yet, so they might make more changes --- it's just our standard GISB agreement.   I think Trunkline should actually review before Shelley anyway.   (for discussion purposes)

Sharon,

I have placed several calls to Shelley about the Trunkline OBA.
I have not heard back and she is not in today.
So, I just sent the draft to Mike to get his input.
