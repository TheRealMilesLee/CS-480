Mike:  the draft comments read very well, however I would echo Jeff's
comments on the price cap.  We should advise against, but still support the
RPD overall.  No other comments to add.

Subject: RE: I. 99-07-003 Draft Comments on the Revised Proposed
Decision


Mike:  Comments looks good.  My only comment is that, in our view, the
price cap (which would cover ALL capacity in the secondary market) is
simply bad economic policy and won't address any problems--in fact it
will only create problems. (From a practical perspective, I'm not even
sure that the Commission can successfully "regulate" prices in the
secondary market.)
 
Will the commission change the price cap provisions of the decision
based comments advising against them?  Very unlikely.  
 
But when the caps create problems (and they will), I want to have been
on record advising the Commission of why caps are bad economic policy
and pointing out the bad outcomes that caps will cause.  I think that
it's very important to point out the downside of caps and to be on
record against them.  
 
That said, I don't want the comments to be so negative as to cloud
support for the decision; nor do I think the Commission will change the
cap based on our comments.  Other than that, EES and ENA can sign on.
Anyone have any objections to pointing out the fact that price caps are
ill-advised?
 
Best,
Jeff

	Enclosed for your review are the draft comments on the Revised
Proposed
	Decision in the Gas Restructuring Investigation.  WGSI and Enron
have
	indicated a desire to file supportive comments.  Edison has
indicated an
	interest in reviewing our draft for the purpose of considering
joining in
	our comments.  Please send edited electronic versions with
underline and
	strikeout to MBD at this address no later than noon tomorrow.
These comments
	must be filed tomorrow before 5 pm.  I am sorry for the lateness
of the
	draft, but these are not extensive comments.  Except for the
little
	bombshell about extending commission jurisdiction over gas
marketers, I see
	little in the RPD to warrant our opposition.  Even if the
Commission
	proceeds with the jurisdictional grab, I believe it can be
overturned by the
	Court of Appeals.
	
	I look forward to your comments.
	
	Mike Day
