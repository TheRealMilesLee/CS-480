Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, Inc. has provided Enron with a letter of credit through January 31, 2002 and Wendy is now comfortable in amending their EOL profile.  We will open their access to trade US East and US West Physical Power with a 2 month tenor.  When we enter the calendar month of November this tenor will be decreased to 1 month and when we enter the calendar month of December this tenor will be decreased to 0 months.

If possible, could we please have this amended for trading - beginning of the day on Monday.  I have made the requisite credit changes in Profile Manager.

Thanks in advance!
