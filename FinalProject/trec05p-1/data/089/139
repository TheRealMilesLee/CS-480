Here's the new password for the customer list for Meco:

DFCUSLSTPUMKIN11

If this doesn't work you may have to call Meco since you're listed as the primary contact.

I called MECO to get the password to the list of customers that is available on the web and they told me that the only person listed to get the list is Richard.  

Richard,
Do you have a password?
