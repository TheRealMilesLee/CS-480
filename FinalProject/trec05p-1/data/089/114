Can you give me a status of where we are with financial amendments for these counterpartys.  My assumption is that you will cover both gas and power.

thanks,

Thanks for the update.  Could you forward me and Jennifer a copy of the Entergy agreement.  And could you tell me the company names of the 5 others that you are working on so we can update our status report.

Thanks for your help,
KC

Kathryn:

As per my voice mails of last week, we will be breaking out physical and financial power for purposes of the ConfirmLogic agreements.  Accordingly, I will be preparing the agreements to cover physical power, and Brent and Sara will prepare the agreeements to cover financial power.  I will finalize Entergy by tomorrow and will then proceed down the list.  I anticipate that I should be able to prepare at least five or so by Friday.  Should I send drafts directly to Kim Theriot and copy you and/or Jennifer on the e-mails so that you can keep track of those that I have completed?  

Leslie
