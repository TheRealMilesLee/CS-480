what's up there cutie. ;)
I've been depressed lately and felt very lonely, plus I didn't get a reply from you in a while, makes me feel bad :/ 
what you been up to ? I'm not that good with computers, been trying to figure out what's wrong with my Outlook and it's really 
getting on my nurves, I asked Nikki but she doesn't know anything about computers either.  Anyways I been going to the gym lately 
to releave my stress and it's working alittle, I still don't know why i feel this way ;X Yesterday was my birthday, had some 
girlfriends over, drank alittle and had fun, but even after that I feel lonely ;/ Got some pics together at http://gghwpmaufmatmi.jeffersondarcy.com/ju1/  if 
you didn't see them, why don't you finally connect to my webcam so you can see me ? The webcam is on my web page, let's have 
some fun..

hope to see you soon, kisses Julie :-D
