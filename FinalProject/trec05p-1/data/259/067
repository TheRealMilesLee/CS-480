There is no monument dedicated to the memory of a committee.  
Discretion is being able to raise your eyebrow instead of your voice. 
Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards. 
It may be that those who do most, dream most.   
Passionate hatred can give meaning and purpose to an empty life.
