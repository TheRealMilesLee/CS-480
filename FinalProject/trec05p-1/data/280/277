The fund in question was approved by the Government of Russia for the payment / settlement of Yukos Oil contractors/suppliers to prevent them from loosing the money they invested in the numerous/various contracts they executed by various /different contractors for Yukos Oil company. 
-
The Russian Government had already concluded plans to frozen all the accounts in Mikhail Khodorkovsky's name both corporate and personal before I connived with the Accountant General of the Yukos Oil Company (who is also my partner in this transaction) to raise a memo to the Russian Government stating that Yukos Oil Company owe Local and Foreign contractors - Two hundred and fifty six million dollars - which the Government agreed and approved the amount for payment after 8 month of closed deliberations.
 -
Actually, we over invoiced /increased/raised the applied contract amount for payment with fifty six Million dollars. And we have paid 30% of the contractors both local and foreign before the Russian Government approve the payment amount because they agitated for their payment when they hard about the Company's problem with the Russian Government.
-
WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU / YOUR ROLE:
I/We like/wise to present you / your company as one of the contractors, Yukos Oil Company owes, so that you can stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum or PART of the fund according to your financial strength or the strength of your company. 
-
I/We will arrange for the documentation that the payee bank will need/use to transfer the payment to you/your Company as the Contractor. 
-
You will be rewarded with 10% of the total sum for your partnership, if interested and capable to receive the funds without the interference of any 3rd party or Russian Government.
