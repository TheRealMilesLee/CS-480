Dear friend,

I am Mr. Richard Wilford, the only son of late Chief John Wilford from Si=
erra-Leone.
I got your contact from the internet directory and need assistance from y=
ou.
My sources of your contact gave me encouragement and confidence to write
you.

I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek for your assist=
ance
to transfer our cash of (Thirty Nine Million United Stated Dollars) (39,0=
00,000.00)
now in the custody of the Security and trust Company here in Spain to you=
r
private account pending our arrival to your country.

SOURCES OF THE FUND
My late father, chief John Wilford, a native of Mende District in the nor=
thern
province of Sierra-Leone, he was the general manager of Sierra-Leone Mini=
ng
Co-operation (S.L.M.C) Freetown. According to my father, this money was t=
he
income accrued from mining co-operation overdraft and minor sales. Before=

the peace of the civil war between the rebel forces of Major Paul Kororma=
h
and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that almost des=
troyed
my country, following the forceful removal of the civilian elected presid=
ent
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah from power by the rebels. My father had already made a=
rrangement
for his family, my mother, my little sister and myself to be evacuated to=

Spain, with our persona effort and the box containing the money. My fathe=
r
deposited the box in a private security company here in Spain for the saf=
e
custody until after the war when he will join us.

During the war in my country, and following the! Indiscriminate searching=

of the public and government properties by the rebels forces, the Sierra-=
Leone
mining corporation. Was one of the targets looted and destroyed. My fathe=
r
including other top government functionaries were attacked and killed by
the rebels because of the relationship with the civilian president Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah.

As a result of my father's death, our hope of survival was shattered. The=

untimely deaths
caused my mother heart failure and other related complications of which s=
he
later died in hospital after we spent a lot of money on her. Now, my 16 y=
ears
old sister and myself are alone in this strange country suffering without=

any care or help. Without any relation, we are now like refugees and orph=
ans.
Our only hope now is in you and the box deposited in a
Security Company.

To this effect, I humbly solicit for your assistance in the following way=
s.
To assist me claim this box from Security Company as co-beneficiary. To t=
ransfer
this money in your name and to your country and to make good arrangement
for a joint business investment on our behalf in your country, and you wi=
ll
be the caretaker, and also to secure a college for my little sister and m=
yself
in your country to further our education. And to make arrangement for our=

travelling with you to your country after you have transferred this fund.=

Most importantly, the security company officials do not know the exact co=
ntent
of the box because it was declared as family valuables. The whole documen=
t
issued after deposit is in my custody. For your assistance, I have conced=
ed
25% of the money to your efforts assistance.

If really want assist us in this transaction kindly send an e-mail to the=

above e-mail address also to the below e-mail address. E-mail:
richwilf@zwallet.com

Best of Regards,



Richard Wilford.
