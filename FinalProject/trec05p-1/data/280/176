Are you tired of Public Companies without anything substantial backing their story - how about a revolutionary invention that will change the Security industry forever, and the company just went public!!! 


Company Name: Sniffex inc 
Ticker: SNFX.PK 


Rating: Strong Buy 


Industry: Security, Homeland Security, Cargo Screening and Explosion Detection Systems


DO NOT BUY THIS STOCK if you want to just play it for a few days, this issue will bring best returns only for long term investors who realize the potential of the company and the fact that 2-3
contracts on government level could skyrocket the stock price above $10-20.



Reason for the TOP 2005 Rating: Unique Explosive Detection Device Capable of finding its targets from tens or hundreds of meters!!!
There is no other EDS device which is so powerfull that can locate almost any explosve behind concrete walls from distance of tens of meters!! 


The Competition: There are many companies in the industry of Sniffing explosives, some of them are public and they are companies like iSON HWPR or HiET and all of them have devices which can locate exp losive from 10 inches, 1 feet, 2 feet or close to that.
Compared to these results SN - FX device is tens of times better and smaller in size and yet CHEAPER!! 


"SNFX.PK announced the release of snif fex Version 1.1, a handheld explosives detection device which the Company claims can locate nitro-based explosives from a distance of 10 to 100 feet depending on the quantity of the explosive and environmental conditions.
The Company also stated that, to the best of their knowledge, sniffex is the first device of its kind that can operate from such distances and find exp losives behind barriers." 


Could this company be amongst the top deals on wallstreet this year!!!
YES its trading at only $1 now and this brand new stock could be $5-10 easily in the next few weeks as the story unfolds!! 

DO NOT BUY THIS STOCK if you want to just play it for a few days, this issue will bring best returns only for long term investors who realize the potential of the company and the fact that 2-3 contracts on government level could skyrocket the stock price above $10.


SNFX.PK is in process of presenting the new device in USA and to Worldwide Markets and as soon as they receive some substantial orders and feedback from big institutional clients,
this stock will fly in the skies, as an example iSON traded almost 1 billion dollars after they announced they are in process of developing some device, and SNFX.PK already has the device and it proved it works in numerous tests!! 


Company Name: Sniffex inc 
Ticker: SNFX.PK 


Rating: Strong Buy 


This stock is going to be the hottest issue for the summer!!
