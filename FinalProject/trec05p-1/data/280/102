Dear Sir 
 
I am Mr.John Udeka,Bank Manager of ACB International Bank plc Lagos ,Nige=
ria.I
got your contact from the world trade center (WTC)Regional office in lago=
s,Nigeria.
Although the details of my intention was not made known to them.Actually,=
I
listed your name amongst four other names & prayed over them & decided to=

contact you directly. 
I have a very urgent & confidential bussiness proposition for you & for
our overall mutual interest.
on june 6 2001,an American oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian Na=
tional
Petroleum Corporation Mr Williams Paul made a numbered time(fixed) deposi=
t
for twelve calendar months,valued at USD$25,000,000.00(twenty five millio=
n
dollars) in my branch.
 Upon maturity,i sent a routine notification to his forwarded address but=

got noreply. 
After a month we sent a reminder,& finally we discovered from his contrac=
t
employers NNPC,that Mr.Williams died in an automobile accident.
 On further investigation,i found out that he did not leave a WILL & all
attempts to trace his nextof kinwere fruitless. 
I therefore made further investigation & discovered that Mr.Williams Paul=

did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents,including
his bank deposit paperwork. 
This sum USD$25,000,000.00 is still floating in the bank and the interest=

is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. 
No one will come forward to claim it. 
According to Nigerian Laws,At the expiration of 7years,the money  will re=
vert
to the ownership of the Nigerian government if nobody applies to claim th=
e
funds. 
Consequently,my proposal is that iwill like you as a foreigner to stand
in as a next of kin of Mr Williams Paul. 
This is simple 
1)I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names & addres=
s
so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents & affidavits,wh=
ich
will put you as next of kin. 
2)We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting & notarizati=
on
of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/admi=
nistration
in your favour for the transfer. 
3)A bank account in any part of the world,which you will provide to facil=
itate
the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary. 
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of
60% for me and 40% for you.
There is no risk at all as the attorney and my position will do the paper=
work
for this tansaction as the branch manager guarantees the successful execu=
tion
of this transaction. 
If you are interested,please reply immediately via this private email add=
ress.

Upon your response,Ishall then provide you with more details and relevant=

documents that will help you understand.PLEASE OBSERVE UTMOST CONFIDENTIA=
LITY,and
be rest assured that this would be most profitable for both of us because=

i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Await=
ing
your urgent reply via this email:judeka2001@myway.com. 
above,please save me the anxiety of endless waiting.
God bless you.
