Icon will be closed on Monday, 5/27/02 in observance of the Memorial Day holiday. 
Next week is also payroll week. To make this a smooth and easy process for everyone, we ask that hours and/or timesheets be turned in by NOON on Friday 5/24/02. If you anticipate that you will have hours over the weekend, please make sure that we get your complete hours worked no later than 10 am on Tuesday to avoid those additional hours not being processed on the 5/31 payroll. 
 
Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation.
