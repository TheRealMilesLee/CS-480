ISO Market Participants:
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") November 7 and 20, 2001
orders, require the ISO, among other things, to stop providing information
to the California Department of Water Services, California Energy Resource

Coordinators ("SCs").  Set forth below is the ISO's schedule for halting
provision of such data to CERS.
A.	Information Already Stopped
1.	On November 13, 2001, the ISO stopped providing to CERS the BEEP
Stack prices for hourly aggregate Mw. 
2.	On November 16, 2001, ISO stopped providing to CERS the PG&E, SCE
and SDG&E Hour-Ahead Schedules. 
B.	Schedule to Stop Additional Market Information Relating to
Forecasts, BEEP Stack and OOM Costs 
1.	At HE2400 on November 30, 2001, the ISO will stop providing to CERS
information on:
a.	Munis' Hour-Ahead Schedules; 
b.	Hourly Direct Access Load;
c.	ISO forecasted Load per IOU;
d.	Average Hourly BEEP Stack volume and costs, including both
incremental and decremental bids and prices;

Forecasted net short in the BEEP Stack;
b.	CERS will no longer engage in OOM purchases; and
c.	The ISO will dispatch all available Energy from bids in the BEEP
Stack for both resources prior to the ISO making OOM purchases.
