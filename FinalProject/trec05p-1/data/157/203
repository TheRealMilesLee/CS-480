My group has scrubbed the teams per your request and excluded items such as rent, outside legal costs, systems development, etc. If you look at the individual team tab towards the bottom of the spreadsheet you'll see the items that have been removed. We've also adjusted Other Expenses for any unusual items that may have been coded there. Please let me know if you'd like for us to forecast 2002 expenses based on this information.

East Power "Other Expenses" is reasonable.  Management book has the FERC filing fee coded there and Fundamentals has subscriptions.

Thanks
