Subject: SoCal GIR/Unbundling Proceeding



In yet another twist of this proceeding Com. Wood has issued an Alternate Proposed Decision for unbundling the SoCal system.  While he issued it Monday it was just Noticed today and if we want to file comments they are due Tuesday Dec. 4th.  Greg, you may recall that we just recently filed our support of Com. Bilas' October 11th Proposed Decision which adopted the Comprehensive Settlement that Transwestern has supported throughout this proceeding.  I'll contact you on Monday about possibly filing comments to reiterate our support of the CS.  Below is the direct address on the CPUC website to the Alt. PD, its about 105 pages.  I'm in the process of reviewing it--please advise if you have any comments or opinion about filing additional comments.  gh
