Mr. Lay:
 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for all the hard work you are trying to do, and continue to try to do, on behalf of those of us who will always be proud to call Enron 'home'.  I joined Enron a short 11 months ago, and moved from the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission to do so, and will likely never regret taking the leap. I have learned so much of value here, have broadened my horizons by orders of magnitude, and worked with so many top quality people, that I cannot help but feel better for the experience.  I have enjoyed professional success and satisfaction beyond my wildest dreams with Enron, and will always carry the confidence of having succeeded amongst the best there are in the business.  I cannot help but feel terrible that so many wish to lay blame where it does not belong, but I can only assume that in times of crisis, laying blame may soothe nerves and provide some comfort.  Know that there are still many at Enron who admire the enormity of what you have done for energy markets in the United States, and have never doubted your integrity.  As I, like many others, inevitably move on in these coming weeks and months, I will leave with mainly good memories, and of course, the regret that such an awesome organism like Enron could not survive forever.  My prayers and thoughts are with you as you work so hard at preserving our core businesses, and again, thank you for giving me the opportunity to have been a part of Enron.  I will always be proud to have worked under your direction and leadership.
 
Best Regards,
 
Andrew Kosnaski
