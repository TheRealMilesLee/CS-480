This development wi|l be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $120
milli0n in development expenditures. Once comp|eted, this Wind Park will supply
upwards of 170,O00 Mw of e|ectricity annually for Po|and and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supply upwards of 25,O00 homes with
electricity and offset nearly 17O,0OO tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Tota| gross
e|ectric sales over a 2O-year period are estimated at over $45O mi||i0n for a

development of renewab|e energy sources (RES) in Poland through the construction
of RES projects, the development of innovative technologies, and the creation of
relevant po|icies, strategies and p|ans. To fu|fil| the mission, EC BREC uses
its own research capabi|ities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and internationa| organizations.
