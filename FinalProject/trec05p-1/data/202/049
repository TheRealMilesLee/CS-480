So, I do not know if this will get to you . But if it does- I pulled out of 
the parkingg lot the other night and drove up Beaverton Hillsdale, went left 
onto the street to your house,and I donot have the faintest idea of how to 
get to your house!! Shocking since I am always half crocked! Not meant to be 
funny. Anyway, I should have callled-Do not have your # in my new 
phon-BLAH,BLAH. I was looking forward to not being hammed around you for 
once. So, if you get this(I got the adress off your business card I just 
found in my wallet) WB or call 901-0376. I am extremly embarresed and I am 
sure when you think of me it is not good. But there could be a slim chance 
that you still have one ounce of respect for me. So, if you do , I will talk 
to you soon. I am sorry !!!!! Noelle
