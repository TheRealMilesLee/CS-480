Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is SALIM IBRAHIM a merchant in Dubai,in the U.A.E.I have been diagnos=
ed with Esophageal cancer It has defiled all forms of medical treatment,and r=
ight now I have only about a few months to live,according to medical experts.=
I have not particularly lived my life so well,as I never really cared for any=
one (not even myself) but my business.Though I am very rich,I was never gener=
ous,I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that wa=
s the only thing I cared for.

But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just =
wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe when God gives m=
e a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way =
from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me,I have willed and given =
most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as=
well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my sou=
l so,I have decided to give also to charity organizations, as I want this tob=
e one of the last good deeds I do on earth.So far,I have distributed money to=
some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that myhe=
alth has deteriorated so badly,I cannot do this myself anymore.I once asked m=
embers of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money whic=
h I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan,they refused =
and kept the money to themselves.

Hence,I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with what =
I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge =
cash deposit of (Twenty million five hundred thousand u.s dollars) that I hav=
e with a finance/Security Company abroad.I will want you to help me collect t=
his consignment and dispatched it to charity organizations.I have set aside 1=
5% for you,the n 5% for any expenses insured.Dear,should you made up your min=
dto assist,kindly write me on,

Note:please contact me through my personal email below.E-MAIL: salim55ibrahim=
@netscape.net (OR) salim55ibrahim@kittymail.com

so that,i will give you all details regard the safety and successful procurem=
ent of this fund.I am awaiting your earliest possible response.

Yours truly,

Salim Ibrahim.
