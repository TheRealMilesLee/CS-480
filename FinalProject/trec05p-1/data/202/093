<bigger>Amy,


Sorry I'm just now getting around responding to your comments of December
26:


>Most Montrose neighborhoods have a very unfortunate layout (with respect
to theft and >vandalism) - almost every street is a cross street, so that
people can get in and out of the >neighborhood very easily.  

<bigger>  

</bigger>>This has been discussed with the Mayor's office in past years,
but the "need for alternate >routes out of downtown" so far has
overshadowed issues such as this.

</bigger>

I know that 1990's planners--like the people who designed the
Woodlands--thought that old fashioned city grids   were bad, but I think
they're wonderful.  Thieves and vandals are a minority.  The majority of
us should be grateful for the many options we have for getting from here
to there.  If we're rushing down Montrose to a concert at Rice and the
Boulevard looks crowded, we can take almost any right turn to get to
Mandell and a straight hot south.  We can take Dunleavy to Krogers if we
have to drop something off at the post office or Woodhead if we're just
trying to avoid the corner of Montrose and West Gray.


We can get to Southland--Fairview to Morse--without ever getting on a
major thoroughfare.  Lyda's been attending a conference at the Marriot
across from the Galleria and she takes Willard to Sage and then left
directly to the hotel. 


We take different routes justs to see different sites.  And we have
friends we can visit without ever getting on a busy street.  Compare that
to living in the "planned" communities out FM1960 where there are often
no connecting streets between neighborhoods and you have to get on FM1960
to get to the grocery store your the bank.  


Now that you're in the big time, Super Neighborhood Scene, I hope you
will point out to the experts that us inner city people don't want gated
communities and circular streets that don't go anywhere.


Hilary
