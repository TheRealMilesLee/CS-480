etc.

Sally has a hard-copy with a little more detail. Several of us will be getting together either tomorrow or Sunday to put together as much of the infrastructure together as possible. We're going to need at least a draft of the backoffice people and boxes. We'd also like you to be a part of it if possible. We'll send out an email/voicemail to let everyone know when/where.
