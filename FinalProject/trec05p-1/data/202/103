OMB ISSUES INFORMATION QUALITY STANDARDS TO AGENCIES
The Office of Management and Budget has issued guidelines to federal agencies to add information quality standards to the procedural requirements agencies must meet with regard to their disseminated information.  The agencies can be sued if information agencies disseminate or use to develop regulations, fails to meet OMB's standards.
At least 50 federal offices are covered by OMB's guidelines, including: the Environmental Protection Agency, the White House, the Department of Defense, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

For more information, contact Kathryn Holmes at holmesk@asme.org. 


STATE OF TECHNOLOGY IN MARYLAND TO BE HELD IN ANNAPOLIS

ASME will join with the Technology Council of Maryland in co-sponsoring an annual gathering of Maryland lawmakers and industry leaders to discuss technology-based economic development.  This year's program will feature technology-based entrepreneurship.  Hear about challenges, accomplishments and opportunities from successful Maryland technology start-ups as well as examine how schools and universities are preparing future engineering, science and technology entrepreneurs. 

The summit will be held in Annapolis on February 4.  For program and registration details, go to http://www.asme.org/gric/
If you have additional questions, please contact Reese Meisinger at meisingerr@asme.org.


NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERING SEES FUNDING INCREASE

Congress increased the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB)'s budget from its $2 million start-up funding in FY2001 to $40 million for FY2002, plus an additional $72 million in existing imaging and biomedical funding transferred to NIBIB from other national health institutes.  In report language, a nine-member extramural task force was called for to review bioengineering and imaging projects throughout the National Institutes of Health.  

For more information, please contact Melissa Murray at murraym@asme.org.


PRESIDENT SIGNS BROWNFIELDS LEGISLATION

Last week, President Bush signed legislation aimed at boosting clean up of brownfields, abandoned or underutilized industrial or commercial properties.  Redevelopment of these properties is hindered by possible environmental contamination and potential liability.  The bill provides liability protection for contiguous property owners, prospective purchasers, and innocent landowners and authorizes increased funding for state and local programs that assess and clean up brownfields.  The legislation had bipartisan support.

The President also announced that his FY 03 budget will double the funds available through the EPA for FY02, to help states and communities around the country clean up and revitalize these sites.   Urban redevelopment and brownfields cleanup also will be funded at a level of $25 million through the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
