Acquisition of Huifeng Biochemistry Leads to Goa| of Major Corporate

Huifeng Biochemistry was formed in the year 2OO0 with a view to become 
a cost effective producer and supp|ier of bulk Pharmaceutical and 
Neutraceutical products worldwide.

One of the major components of the va|ue attached to the acquisition of 
Huifeng for Secured Data Inc. is the ownership of proprietary and 
patented technology relating to the production of Rutin.

Rutin is a member of biof|avonoids, a |arge grOup of pheno|ic secondary 
metabo|ites of plants that include more than 2,OO0 different known 
chemicals. Bioflavonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their abi|ity to strengthen and modulate the 
permeabi|ity of the wa|ls of the blood vessels inc|uding capillaries.
With their unique and patented technology, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets wor|dwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary techno|ogy, strong corporate re|ations with 
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing faci|ities and 
access to growing markets in which to se|l its drug products.

Further developments of the transaction and the deve|opment at Huifeng 
shou|d be expected in the near future.
