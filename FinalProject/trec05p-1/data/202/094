Maria- 

In follow up to our discussion yesterday.  I spoke with our staff and confirmed that we intend to have our counter offer out to you by this afternoon.  I apologize for the delay on our part, but unfortunately some of our staff has been out of the office.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.
