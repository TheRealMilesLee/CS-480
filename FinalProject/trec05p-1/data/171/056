            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="-1">It is 
              more important than ever to take control of your finances. How will 
              all the world and financial events affect your ability to achieve 
              your personal financial goals? What could or should you consider 
              doing differently? As a valued client, your advisor can help you 
              develop confidence that you are on your way to meet your desired 
              financial goals.</font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="-1">You have 
              already worked hard to develop a sound and clear financial plan 
              that is right for your personal situation. But of course things 
              change. In these times of market uncertainty, now may be a good 
              time to review your goals and plan with your advisor. Through that 
              process, you can adjust your financial strategies to match this 
              dynamic marketplace and your changing needs, keeping you on track 
              to meet your financial goals. </font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="-1">Given 
              the new realities of the financial markets, careful planning is 
              more important than ever. For instance, you may want to consider 
              having your portfolio address a balance of both short-and long-term 
              objectives. Depending upon your situation, investment options can 
              range from a variety of stable-value, income-producing cash reserve 
              products to a wide range of mutual funds and stocks. Your advisor 
              can help you choose the investment types that can help provide an 
              appropriate balance of risk and return for you while helping you 
              to meet your goals. </font></font></p>
