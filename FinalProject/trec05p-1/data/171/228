This all sounds terrific!!!  I will have to check Sea World (I think she'd
really like that better than Six Flags because of the animals...the
dolphins, whales, etc. are so beautiful) for their winter schedule.  They
are only open on weekends in the fall and then do a Christmas special thing
before Christmas and I really don't know if they are open weekends after
Christmas or not.  I will try to find out.

I just talked to Dorcille...Debbie and Jo Beth are coming to their house
Friday...Jo Beth will leave late on Christmas Eve and Debbie will leave
Christmas Day...I would really love to see them...I have not seen Jo Beth's
kids in ages.  Dee asked us for Sun. when she will have all her side of the
family or Mon.  I think Mon. would be better because it would give you guys
a chance to rest up and also the crowd would not be overwhelming.  Dee has
two brothers who have five grown kids between them with spouses and kids so
that is a lot!!!

Lauren could see the beach, too...we'll hope for good weather...so far we've
had a great fall...lots of rain so hopefully that is over and ya'll leave
the cold in CO.

I was going to check on the portacrib to see if you thought Brock would
still fit but if you're bringing one, great.  The woman I borrow it from has
a new baby but she probably isn't using it.

let me know what else I need to get or do...has Kim had Daisy yet???  MJ
