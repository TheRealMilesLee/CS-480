Sally:

Thanks for the updates on today's meeting.

I've worked with Enron for a long time, in Power Settlements with Leslie Reeves, I've also worked with Kim Theriot in Liquids. 
Even thou I have no idea what will happen to our FX/IR settlements group, I was optimistic to hear that at least we will be considered
to new positions if these are available.

Thanks again for keeping us informed.

Ana Rizvi
