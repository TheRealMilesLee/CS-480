Hey Paul-- 

OK, first, I'm sorry I missed your call Mon night--I was looking forward to talking to you! Secondly, sorry I didn't follow up your call with an email... It's been sort of a strange week in that I thought it was going to be really slow, but then have been busy not only during the day, but have had work obligations every evening, too--including this evening. While I'm usually happy to go home, I'll be particularly so this week. I just can't believe that Christmas is next week already. Ugh. 

Did you make it up skiing yesterday? If so, where'd you go? How was the snow?  While it did snow last weekend, it didn't start until Sat afternoon and we went back to Denver Sat night--in the midst of the snowstorm--so really didn't get to enjoy any of the fresh snow... just the headaches it caused. 

I'm glad to hear that at least your boss is optimistic about your future options...I'm less so about my own future, but at least being unemployed now would mean more time on the slopes. 

In any case, I have a dinner this evening with my team, but should be home (hotel home) around 10ishEST. If you're around this evening,  maybe we could try to talk then?  I'm dying to hear your theories on Elvis... 

:-)

Hey,

Got your email, I'm sorry your weekend didn't turn out as well as you might have expected, at least that's the message I'm getting. I thought about you this weekend when the weather turned out to be nice, and we had fresh snow on Saturday night. I hope you didn't get hurt skiing.

I think I'm skiing tomorrow. There isn't anything going on around here and probably won't be for awhile. Our boss was here Friday night for our Christmas party. He thought once everything was finalized we would like this new deal. So I hope he's right, it's still way too early to tell.

I'll try and call you this evening. I'm looking forward to the conversation. Remember keep your sarcasm in check, you know how sensitive I am.

Topics Open for discussion;

1.) Solutions for solving world hunger
2.) Is Elvis still alive and if so where is he. (I have a theory or two on this on! e)
3.) NSYNC or the Backstreet Boys, which group is more GAY
4.) Is Britney Spears really Madonna's love child

Paul
