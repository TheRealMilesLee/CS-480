PRIVATE AND URGENT
From: BANK OF SCOTLAND,
LONDON BRANCH.

PRIVATE AND URGENT.
Please do not be offended if I have invaded your privacy. I am MR.
	emmarson, and I am contacting you on business transfer of a huge
sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that a transaction
of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am
assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. I decided to
contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.
PROPOSITION.
I am the account officer to Mr Salah Adam (deceased) one of our
foreign customers. While he banked with us, I oversaw his accounts and
other official/financial obligations as my office demanded being his
accounts officer. Unfortunately, he died along with his entire family
in the plane crash of 31 October, 1999 on board the Egyptian Airline
990 alongside other passengers. Please consult the website below for
verification.
http://www.greatdreams.com/PassEAir990.htm
While he was alive, none of his family members was ever known to me
other than his immediate nuclear family. Since his death, none of his
next-of-kin or relations has come forward to lay claims to this money
as the heir. I cannot release the fund from his account unless someone
applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in
our banking guidelines.
Having made a very franatic and exhaustive search for any family
member that would lay claim to this fund, I decided to take my chance
with you. I now seek your permission to have you stand as next of kin
to the deceased as I have all documentations including his certified
Death Certificate that will facilitate your stand as next of kin to
him as he had a closing balance of  £5,500,000.00 (five million, five
hundred thousand pounds sterling) here in our bank in London. I also
have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any
member of deceased family to become beneficiary of this fund.
Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual
business endeavour by furnishing me with the following, vial reply to
my private E-mail:
1. Beneficiary name and address
2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers
These requirements will enable me make some internal re-adjustments
and file your name in form A2ag and other vital forms as next of kin
which before now was left blank by the deceased upon opening of the
account six years ago. Upon your reply, I will advice the way forward.
I must assure you that if you are serious and follow my lead
religiously, then this funds will be released to you within a
seven-working-day period.
If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of
the trust I have bestowed in you, I await your urgent mail.
Please reply to my private
Note:Reply me through my alternative email address:
emmarson_mike2005@hotmail.com
Best Regards,
