Dear Sir,=20
Compliments of the day!   I got your contact on my private search for a rel=
iable and trusted person to handle a transaction of this nature. I know tha=
tthe contents of this mail might sound so strange, but I want to assure  yo=
u that every word of it is true.I am Mr.Mark D.Anderson, credit officer of =
the AFC Merchant Bank.I have a  concealed business suggestion for you.Befor=
e the plane crash of macedonian's president and his cabinet members on Febr=
uary 26, 2004 , our client  Mile Krstevsk from the Ministry of Foreign Affa=
irs,macedonia and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 ca=
lendar months, with a value of Nine Million,Six Hundred Thousand United Sta=
te Dollars only in my branch.You can visit this website:
http://antiwar.com/deliso/?articleid=3D2043
  After his death  it was also discovered that Mile Krstevsk  did not decla=
re any next of kin in his official papers including the paperwork of his ba=
nk deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office th=
at no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.So, Nine Million,Six Hun=
dred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one wil=
l ever come forward to claim it.     What bothers me most is that according=
 to the to the  laws of my country at the expiration two  years the funds w=
ill revert to the ownership of the Singapore Government if nobody applies t=
o claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my  suggestion to you is that I wi=
ll like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of  kin to Mile Krstevsk  s=
o that you will be able to receive his funds.WHAT IS TO BE DONE:  I want yo=
u to know that I have had everything planned out so that we  shall come out=
 successful.I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary do=
cument that will back you up as the next of kin to Mile Krstevsk  ,all that=
 is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full=
 Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job.After you have=
 been made the next of kin,the attorney will also  file in for claims on yo=
ur behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter ofprobate in your fa=
vor for the move of the funds to an account that  will be provided by you.T=
here is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a le=
galized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents.  =
  Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning th=
is issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank accoun=
t we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5%for any expe=
nses incurred during the course of this operation.Should you be interested =
