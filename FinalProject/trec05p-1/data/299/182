Here rests a widow, who, with music in her tongue, carried gall in her
heart. She used to go round among the families near, and search out their
faults, upon which she preyed with all the envy and malice of her nature.

in their opinions, that they would believe in no other. If the newspapers,
or even the whole world, said of a certain subject, "It is so-and-so;" and a
little schoolboy declared he had learned quite differently, they would take
his assertion as the only true one, because he belonged to the family. And
it is well known that if the yard-cock belonging to this family happened to
crow at midnight, they would declare it was morning, although the watchman
and all the clocks in the town were proclaiming the hour of twelve at night.
