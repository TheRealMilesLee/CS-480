First Rand Bank Of South Africa 





Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Mr Philip Tato, Auditor General of First Rand Bank Of South Africa.This is an urgent and very confidential business transaction. 

On June 6, 2000,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy,Mr.Willam Mitchell made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$7.2m(Seven Million, Two hundred thousand Dollars). 

Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, that Mr.Willam Mitchell died from an automobile accident.On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. 

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Willam Mitchell did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. 
No one will ever come forward to claim it.According to South African Law,at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. 

I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. 

The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you and The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney.If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of 
us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. 

Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax mostly. 

Awaiting your urgent reply via my email Above. 

Philip Tato
