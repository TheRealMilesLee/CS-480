Brick-and-mortar cuts hurt e-tailers

Price discounts by traditional retailers are likely to reduce 
sales for online retailers, according to the Conference Board, a 
nonprofit research group.

"Bargains are not as prevalent because offline stores are 
offering discounts," said the board's director, Lynn Franco. 
"The incentive to shop on the Web is not there." Her group 
conducted a holiday shopping survey and found 22% of its 
respondents indicated they plan to make online purchases, 
compared to 21% a year ago.

Another study of shopping plans, by Chicago-based consulting 
firm Accenture, found a sharp disinterest in online shopping. 
Forty-three percent said they planned to shop less online this 
year than last, while 23% said they would spend more through the 
Web. The big draw for online shoppers was convenience.

China shutters Internet bars

Chinese authorities have closed almost 20% of the country's 
94,000 Internet bars. They failed to install software to block 
access to Web sites the government considers pornographic or 
subversive, the Associated Press reported. "Some youths will 
submerge themselves for long periods, playing unhealthy games 
and adversely affecting their development as normal students," 
according to a Shanghai newspaper. The newspaper estimates about 
27 million Chinese access the Web, 4.5 million through the 
"bars," often one-room shops with PCs.

Trib lets fingers do the advertising

The Chicago Tribune's Web site now allows consumers to create 
classified ads that appear both online and in the newspaper. The 
feature is available from a button labeled "Place an Ad" on 
chicagotribune.com. "People are now accustomed to doing business 
on the Web and through this innovation we address the needs of 
both our private and commercial customers," said Jane Migely, 
director of classified advertising.

Editor's note: Due to the Thanksgiving Day holiday, Internet 
Daily will not be sent on Nov. 22 and 23.
