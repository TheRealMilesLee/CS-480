i have no desire to try to change your mind, but need to understand a couple of things.  can we spend a few minutes on monday or tues?    shoudl i assume that you do not want any responsibility for the runoff book if i leave the company?  that's fine if you dont, i understand it might just be a distraction for you, but if i make a recommendation i want to make sure i accurately reflect your opinion so that i can unravel it or sell it.  i'm talking to belden separately about the west positions.
