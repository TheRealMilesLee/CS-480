Dear Steve:

As per your voicemail message, I have asked the HRGIS team to provide the necessary information so we can send an email message, regarding certification, to those employees at the Vice President level and above, and those employees who have not certified compliance to date.

Please see the draft message prepared for your review and comments:  

	"As you know, Enron's policies regarding business conduct, approved by the Enron Board of Directors, are set forth in Enron's Code of Ethics.

Please let me know when you are ready to proceed with this email.

Thanks.

Sharon
