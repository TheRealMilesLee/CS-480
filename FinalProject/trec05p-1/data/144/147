Jim,

Attached please find the information you were asking for on existing and new headcounts and budgets.  The new budget is just a draft first cut.
I've also included a description for where we are cutting and why.  Please let me know if this is what you were looking for and if it is in the right amount of detail.

Regards,
Rodney
