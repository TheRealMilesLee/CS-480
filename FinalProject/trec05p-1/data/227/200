Dearly Beloved 

It is by the grace of the Lord that I send you this letter ,Having known the truth, I had no 
choice than to do what is lawful and right in the sight of The Lord for eternal life and in 
the sight of man for witness of God´s mercy and glory upon my life.

I am Mrs Melissa Pointer the wife of  Mr Harry Pointer, my husband worked with the 
Chevron/Texaco in Kenya for twenty years before he died in the year 2001.We were married for 
twenty-seven years without a child. My Husband died after a brief illness that lasted for only 
four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. 

Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the 
Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US $3.5M. (Three 
Million Five  Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) with a Bank in Europe .Presently, this money is 
still with the Bank and the management just wrote me as the beneficiary to come forward to 
sign for the release of this money or rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to 
receive it on my behalf if I can not come over.

Presently, I'm in a hospital in Kenya where I have been undergoing treatment for esophageal 
cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a 
few weeks to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity 

organizations any where in the World. Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of 
my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge 
responsibility to any of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand and 
collect the Funds from the Bank.

I want a person that is God fearing that will use this money to fund churches, orphanages and 
widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. 
It is said that  blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this decision because I don't have any 
child that will inherit this money and my 

husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be 
misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly 
manner.Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death 

hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord.
I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my soundless voice and 
presence of my husband's relatives around  me always. 

I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things  are possible. 
As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of  Attorney who is in Europe as 
he will be the one to assist you in laying  claims for this funds.



Yours Ever.
Melissa Pointer.
