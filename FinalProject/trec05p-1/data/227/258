Two-hundred fifty-eight chart envelopes were retrieved from the Houston Office, this afternoon and are now in the hands of GMS.  There are indications that some of the charts have been in the post office since February 4th.  The postal account had been financially depleted for two to three weeks   Enron Property Management will replenish the account no later than Thursday of this week and will put in place the necessary controls to ensure the account is always funded therefore no more charts should be held hostage.

If you have questions, please advise.
