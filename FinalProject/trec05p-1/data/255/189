    On 3/23/02, Helen called the on-call for Tescott concerning a hi gas detection
    alarm she'd received at the station. Gary went out to check the alarm and found
    out that the pre-lube oil pump on unit 5, which is gas powered, was leaking which 
    caused the alarm. Parts for this unit may not be available until next Monday which,
    in turn, means unit 5 will be unavailable until then. Gary confered with Kim on this
    and relayed to us that if any compression is needed on the high side unit 3 is ready
    and can be switched over for us at any time.
