UNFORTUNATELY, TILL THIS MOMENT NO ONE HAS COME AS HIS RELATION FOR HIS DEPOSIT WITH US. MY COLLEAGUES AND I HUMBLY REQUEST YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER SO THAT WE CAN PRESENT YOU AS HIS NEXT OF KIN OR BENEFICIARY TO HIS DEPOSIT. IT IS NOT A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO ESPECIALLY AS YOU SHARE THE SAME LAST NAME WITH HIM AND IT WILL NOT TAKE TIME TOO.
