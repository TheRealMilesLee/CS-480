   forlorn \fur-LORN; for-\, adjective:
   1. Sad and lonely because deserted, abandoned, or lost.
   2. Bereft; forsaken.
   3. Wretched or pitiful in appearance or condition.
   4. Almost hopeless; desperate.

     Henry  had  felt  guilty  at  abandoning his sister; he had
     married not once but twice, leaving Rose forlorn.
     --Anita Brookner, [1]Visitors

     In  these  forlorn regions of unknowable dreary space, this
     reservoir  of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the
     accumulation  of  centuries  of  winters,  glazed in Alpine
     heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre the
     multiplied rigours of extreme cold.
     --Francis  Spufford,  [2]I  May  Be  Some Time: Ice and the
     English Imagination

     Bloch  remembers  that  Stephen  was  a  member of the Milk
     Squad,  comprised  of  children who were considered to need
     extra  nutrition,  and early photographs do show him as one
     of the smaller boys, in the front row, looking forlorn.
     --Meryle Secrest, [3]Stephen Sondheim: A Life
     _________________________________________________________

   Forlorn  comes  from Old English forleosan, "to abandon," from
   for- + leosan, "to lose."
