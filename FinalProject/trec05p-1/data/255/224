¡¡¡¡I felt it rather hard, I must own, to be made, without deserving it,
the subject of jokes between the coachman and guard as to the coach drawing
heavy behind, on account of my sitting there, and as to the greater
expediency of my travelling by waggon. The story of my supposed appetite
getting wind among the outside passengers, they were merry upon it likewise;
and asked me whether I was going to be paid for, at school, as two brothers
or three, and whether I was contracted for, or went upon the regular terms;
with other pleasant questions. But the worst of it was, that I knew I should
be ashamed to eat anything, when an opportunity offered, and that, after a
rather light dinner, I should remain hungry all night - for I had left my
cakes behind, at the hotel, in my hurry. My apprehensions were realized.
When we stopped for supper I couldn't muster courage to take any, though I
should have liked it very much, but sat by the fire and said I didn't want
anything. This did not save me from more jokes, either; for a husky-voiced
gentleman with a rough face, who had been eating out of a sandwich-box
nearly all the way, except when he had been drinking out of a bottle, said I
was like a boa-constrictor who took enough at one meal to last him a long
time; after which, he actually brought a rash out upon himself with boiled
beef.<br>
