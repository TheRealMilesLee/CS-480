   Word of the Day for Sunday March 24, 2002:

   comport \kum-PORT\, transitive verb:
   To conduct or behave (oneself) in a particular manner.

   intransitive verb:
   To  be  fitting;  to  accord;  to agree -- usually followed by
   'with'.

     Considered  friendly  and funny in private, the queen has a
     formal,  remote air in public that some people attribute to
     shyness  and others say is a reflection of her belief that,
     as  monarch,  she  should  comport herself with dignity and
     restraint.
     --Sarah  Lyall,  "Tradition  and Personality Keep Elizabeth
     Far  From  Her  Subjects,"  [1]New York Times, September 5,
     1997

     Her  aides comport themselves like members of a cult, their
     faces a jittery mix of adoration and fear.
     --Maureen  Dowd, "Siamese Senators," [2]New York Times, May
     26, 1999

     It   comports   with   the   clear   meaning  of  the  U.S.
     Constitution.
     --"Making  War  the  Legal  Way,"  [3]Denver Rocky Mountain
     News, March 26, 1998

     Fairchild  says  he decides cases "to comport with previous
     law and also with justice."
     --Cary  Segall,  "Fairchild Keeps on Judgin'," [4]Wisconsin
     State Journal, August 1, 1999
     _________________________________________________________

   Comport  comes  from  Medieval French comporter, "to conduct,"
   from  Latin  comportare,  "to  carry, to bring together," from
   com-, "with, together" + portare, "to carry."
