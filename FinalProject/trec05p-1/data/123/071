Paul/Michelle,
I received a phone call and e-mail from Paul Mollo w/PNM.  It seems we may have over charged
them on their new contract 27606. Can you check into this and let me know if a refund is due PNM.
Thank you, Laura

LG, 
As I informed you yesterday PNM believes that the $0.08 per dth Firm Transportation charge on contract #27606 includes all commodity charges.  Paragraph 2 reads as follows:
"2.  The discounted rate ("Discounted Rate") for the FTS-1 Agreement is as follows: 

$ .0800/MMBTu/day - Total Charge *

*  The combined discounted commodity and reservation rate for the term of this Amendment shall be $ .0800/MMBtu (Total Charge) multiplied by the total contract quantity.  The Total Charge shall include all applicable surcharges, provided that the transportation rates set forth above shall in no event be greater than the maximum or lower than the minimum rates provided in Transwestern's FERC Gas Tariff, as amended from time to time.  Transwestern shall allocate the combined rate between the reservation and commodity components inclusive of surcharges."
Therefore, PNM should not have been charged $3,945.47, on invoice #216544 for commodity charges for October 2001 on contract #27606.  Please refund this overcharge to PNM.
Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.  If you have any questions please call me at (505) 241-2651.
