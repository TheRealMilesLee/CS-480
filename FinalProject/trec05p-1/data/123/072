Net Works is not a marketing affiliate.  We can make changes if they want us to.

Tana - - 

Are there changes to the managers for the above entity?  Current managers are Derrick, Haedicke and Whalley; with many business units removing Derrick and Whalley to comply with the marketing affiliate rule, I did not know if your entities would be subject to the same.

Please let me know.  Thanks.
