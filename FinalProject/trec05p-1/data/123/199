hi Kam,

This is Punit. I have received this email from you but have no other earlier than this one. so when u say 'again' i dont understand. i didnt know i was in such a position and tho i tried to work this from home...i was told i wud not be able to do it unless i put in an 'e-request' which i am in the process of doing. Also i think someone else is trading off my account cos i was on leave and not scheduled to come in till 1730 today and to my surprise i find that there were trades on my account!!!

Please look into this closely including the VaR violation thing.


Thank you.


Punit.


P.S : these are the trades that popped up in my account today from nowhere.

Punit,

You have exceeded your VaR limit again today.  I will be taking $100,000 from your P&L tonight.  You must decrease your position today.
