Errol,

I have saved a DPR, in the regions path, for the NG Gas Deferred for 10/01. Please save the file NGDKRS1001good, as your file for the NGDKRS1001. I had to change your beginning balances for 10/01 to tie to your ending balances for 09/01 and I changed your gross book balance so that it ties to the value in Schedule C. These changes, however, did not change your P&L for the month.

Thanks!
