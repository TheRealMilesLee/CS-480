An extension of the Services contract with Manitoba (MHEB) has been signed and begins tomorrow, November 1st.  In addition to purchasing from MHEB, we need to focus heavily on selling to MHEB.  With the change of season, MHEB may frequently be short.  As with purchases, EPMI will split any net savings with MHEB and adjust their Reference Price accordingly- see 'M:Eservices/MIDWEST SERVICE DEALS/Manitoba/Manitoba Hydro Services Deal Procedures.doc. I realize that  market conditions have not been favorable for doing much business with MHEB, but we need to give this deal more attention.  We are working on other business opportunities with MHEB, and how we handle this deal will affect future relationships with them.    In an effort to generate information with which to formulate strategies to better service MHEB, please maintain the price log located at: M:Eservices/MIDWEST SERVICE DEALS/Manitoba/MHEB Price Log/MHEB November'01.doc. In addition to prices, both hourly and next day, record any relevant market information (see the log for examples). Include responsibility for handling MHEB in the daily transition to the night shift.  Dean will coordinate these efforts. Please call me (cell - 713-962-0526) with any questions.  Thank you!
