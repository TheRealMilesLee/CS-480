Danny,
This is the summary of the commercial terms proposed to IdleAire (all the terms are still subject to further negotiation with IA).  We think we have something solid to work with provided we receive $12-15 mm in total funding over next 6 mos.  I greatly appreciate your continued support and your help in finding us some capital.
Cheers'
Hamd
