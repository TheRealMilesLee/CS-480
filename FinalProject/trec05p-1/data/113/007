Mark-

Greetings.  In light of the "Kase Commentary" on EnronOnline's yearly anniversary, we have reviewed the publication and number of viewers, and would like to end the contract we currently have with Cynthia Kase.  She has supplied EnronOnline with the weekly publication free of charge.  Our feelings have been mirrored by her; she wishes to discontinue publishing the Commentary on the website as well.  I would like to start the ball rolling and begin any documentation needed to discontinue the publication, signed and recognized by both parties.  What are the next steps to take?  Is this something you have time for or is this matter something that we should get Barbara Gray involved in?  

Regards,
Kelly Heuertz
