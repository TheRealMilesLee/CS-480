Kate and Teresa:

We are working on a time sensitive project and ask that you assist us in determining the names of various Enron entities by doing an historical analysis or whatever means you use.

The entities I need info on are:

Enron Gas Processing Company
Enron Gas Marketing Canada
Enron Oil Canada Ltd.
Enron Oil Corporation

Are these prior names of current Enron entities, are they existing entities, etc.?

Please call me if you need any additional info or if my request is confusing.

Thanks for your help!
