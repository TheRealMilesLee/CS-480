I agree, all we are going to do today is transfer Clinton Energy Management Services, Inc. to be a direct subsidiary of Enron Corp. and amend the charter. At this point in time we need to avoid doing anything which will require any filing with FERC or which will jeopardize the power marketing certificate.

Marcus --

I would recommend that Enron not do anything to modify the Clinton MBR tariff at FERC right now.  It may make sense for Sam Behrens to work up a "clean up" filing to be ready to go upon any action.

Pls give me a call if you want to discuss or would like us to take a different approach.

Jim
