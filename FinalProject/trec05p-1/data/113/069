yes, you were a little intoxicated when we spoke last night, but you were
sweet.  That is kind of creepy that it is a full moon on Halloween.  I need
to keep my cat inside because people steal cats on Halloween and skin them.
Well buck up little camper, in the scope of everything, things really aren't
that bad.  You could have to have life altering surgury.  Since this thing
with my family, it really has put a lot of things into perspective.  I hope
you feel better.  Call me later.

Love,
Laurel

i feel a little awful...plus i'm tired.  I hope you weren't looking
forward to speaking with a sober Mat yesterday.  i don't think i was
that drunk, but who knows.  plus, i must be allergic to something
because i can't stop sneezing.  oh, my life just sucks these days...j/k.
anyway, are you looking forward to tonight...especially with a nice full
moon...make sure to look out for the goblins...
