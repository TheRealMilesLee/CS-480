 DEAR SIR/MADAM.

WE ARE MEMBERS OF A SPECIAL COMMITTEE FOR BUDGET AND PLANNING OF 
THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS 
AND HOUSING(FMWH). THIS COMMITTEE IS PRINCIPALLY CONCERNED WITH 
CONTRACT AWARDS AND APPROVAL. 
WITH OUR POSITIONS,WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SECURED FOR OURSELVES 
THE SUM OF
THIRTY ONE MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS 
(US$31.5M). THIS AMOUNT WAS 
CAREFULLY MANIPULATED BY OVER-INVOICING OF AN OLD CONTRACT.
WE BELIEVE YOU WOULD BE IN A POSITION TO HELP US IN TRANSFERING THIS 
FUND (US$31.5M) INTO A SAFE ACCOUNT. IT HAS BEEN AGREED THAT THE 
OWNER OF THE ACCOUNT WILL BE COMPENSATED WITH 25% OF THE 
REMITTED FUNDS, WHILE WE KEEP 65% AS THE INITIATORS AND 10% WILL BE 
SET ASIDE TO OFFSET EXPENSES 
AND PAY THE NECESSARY TAXES.WE INTEND TO USE PART OF OUR OWN 
SHARE TO IMPORT FROM YOUR COUNTRY 
AGRICULTURAL AND CONSTRUCTION MACHINERY.THIS IS BECAUSE THE 
PRESENT GOVERNMENT OF MY COUNTRY
IS EMPHASISING ON PROVIDING FOOD AND HOUSING FOR ALL ITS CITIZENS 
BEFORE THE NEXT ELECTION. 
HENCE,AGRICULTURAL AND CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT ARE IN HIGH DEMAND 
OVER HERE. WE SHALL ALSO NEED 
YOUR ASSISTANCE IN THIS REGARD ON A COMMISSION TO BE AGREED UPON 
WHEN WE FINALLY MEET.
ALL MODALITIES OF THIS TRANSACTION HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY WORKED 
OUT AND ONCE STARTED WILL NOT TAKE 
MORE THAN TWO WEEKS (14) WORKING DAYS, WITH YOUR FULL SUPPORT. 
THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE. IF 
THIS PROPOSAL SATISFIES YOU, PLEASE REACH US ONLY BY EMAIL FOR 
MORE INFORMATION;-.
