David/Steve:

Attached is the spreadsheet you requested.  I was asked to leave the writedowns associated with Raptor blank. As the spreadsheet is currently built, when inserted, these amounts should be on a pre-tax basis.  If you have any questions, I will be in the new Enron building and can be reached on my cell at 713-345-7751.

Trevor
