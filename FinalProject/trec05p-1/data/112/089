I also a voicemail with you.  Can you or someone in your group file a notice on these permits?  HPL Compression was dissolved with the sale of HPL.

Jim, I am not sure who handled the operating permits.  I think that type of stuff was usually handled by someone in the gas pipeline group.

Jim,

Do you know who is responsible for cancelling the operating permits for HPL Compression?  Zero Gross Receipt Tax reports will have to be filed quarterly until that permit is canceled.
