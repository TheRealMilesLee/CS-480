Jeff, did Mark H. sign off on us removing triangular set-off between affiliated entities.  We have removed the concept as instructed by Barry, but do not want to send to PG&E unless we have Mark's OK.

Also, Eric/Barry you were going to canvass Bill in terms of what he would require for Credit.

Peter.
