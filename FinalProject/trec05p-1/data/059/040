FYI.  It looks like we can move ahead with Karen in a temporary assignment, without her losing anything in the transition package offered by EBS.  However ... it may be more difficult to move her to the analyst position than we thought.  She is listed in peoplefinder as a senior admin., but she is actually a number of pay levels below that ... .

Do we want say anything about not filling the administrative assistant position during the 30-day period--so she knows that she will "be considered" for the AA job if the evaluation for the professional position doesn't pan out the way she wants it to?  Also re:  date.  I want to know whether she's interested in the assignment by October 31.

Re:  Rick.  Yes.  I think we need to send it along to him.

Paul -- please review and let me know if you'd like to make any revisions.  I can then send to Karen today.  Also, do you need to run this by Rick?  Please let me know if you'd like for me to discuss with him.

Thanks.

Karen -- as you are aware, your current position as Administrative Assistant to Scott Bolton will be ending as of Monday, October 1st, at which time you are scheduled for 45 days of redeployment.  As an alternative, the following option is being proposed:

Due to the resignation of the Administrative Assistant in the Portland Government Affairs office, Paul Kaufman and Alan Comnes have an immediate need for an Administrative Assistant.  We are also aware of your desire to advance into a professional level position within the Government Affairs group.  In order to meet the objectives of both the office and your goals, we would like to extend you the opportunity to work as the administrative assistant in the group for an initial 31-day assignment.  During this period (October 1-31), you will fill the administrative needs of the department in addition in allowing Paul to perform an evaluation of your skills and growth potential into a professional role in Goverment Affairs.  At the conclusion of this assignment, if there is not a continued opportunity for you to continue to work in the administrative assistant's role with the potential of future growth into a professional level position, you will then be allowed to enter into your 45-day redeployment period.  

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this option or would like to discuss further.  I can be reached at
713-853-0363.  Please let me know your decision no later than _______________ .
