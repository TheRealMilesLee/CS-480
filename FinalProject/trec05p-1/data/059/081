Juan......This is Jim Cashion in Volume Management. I'll be taking over the hourly stuff from Michael Jacobson. I'm looking for some info on tag 176534.  Aquila is the CP and it looks like it was for 25 mw at $10 on 8/17/2001.  I cannot find this in the hourly P&L or in enpower.  If you could point me in the right direction, I would appreciate it. Thanks.
