Dear Friend,


My name is SALIM IBRAHIM a merchant in Dubai, in
the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer
It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and
right now I have only about a few months to live,
according to medical experts.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I
never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my
business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous,
I was always hostile to people and only focused on my
business as that was the only thing I cared for. But
now I regret all this as I now know that there is more
to life than just wanting to have
or make all the money in the world.

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to
this world I would live my life a different way from
how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I
have willed and given most of my property and assets
to my immediate and extended family members as well as
a few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so,
I have decided to give also to charity
organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed
money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E,
Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.

I once asked members of my family to close
one of my accounts and distribute the money which I
have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and
Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to
themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as
they seem not to be contended with what I have left
for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge
cash deposit of (Twenty million five hundred thousand u.s dollars)

that I have with a finance/Security
Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect
this consignment and dispatched it to charity
organizations.

I have set aside 15% for you,then 5% for any expenses insured.
God be with you.

SALIM IBRAHIM

NOTE: please my friend, becuase of security reasons kindly
respond back to me via my most confidential email box at

salimibrahim05@netscape.net

I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR URGENT RESPONSE
