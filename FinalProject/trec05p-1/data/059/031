Doug, I got a call from Don Mohler this morning wanting to know if we had
done a cursory check of faults and seismicity in the vicinity of the
SunDevil route.  He said to get back to you with the information.  Overall,
the probability of seismic activity in the region is low.  Additionally,
there are not many major faults showing up in the vicinity of the project.
We have a lady taking a closer look at Alquist-Priolo maps, but we don't
expect faults and seismic activity to be a major issue for the project.  We
will provide more detailed information if we find anything worth mentioning
on the Alquist-Priolo maps.  Scott
