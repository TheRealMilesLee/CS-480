No advise and consent rights.  The gov picks the CPUC President period.  The
Senate consents to the appointment of commissioners only.

Mike:  Does that legislation that passed a couple of years ago(?) that
gives the Governor the power to appoint the PUC president also give the
Senate advise and consent rights on the appointment of the president?  I
don't recall that it gave the Senate advise and consent rights, but sure
would be interesting if it does.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
