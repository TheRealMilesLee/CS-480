FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT
IKOYI-LAGOS
FROM:DR.DAVID JONES
TEL:234-802-306-2873
Dear Sir,

ASSISTANCE REQUIRED FOR ACQUISITION OF ESTATE
I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates or landed properties in your country on
behalf of the Director of Contracts and Finance Allocations of the Federal Ministry of Works and
Housing in Nigeria.

Considering his very strategic and influential position, he would want the transaction to be as
strictly confidential as possible. He further wants his identity to remain undisclosed at least for
now, untill the completion of the transaction. Hence our desire to have an
overseas agent.I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as our overseas
agent in order to actualize this transaction.The deal, in brief, is that the funds with which we
intend to carry out our proposed investments in your country is presently in a coded account at the
Nigerian Apex Bank (i.e. the Central Bank of Nigeria) and we need your assistance to transfer the
funds to your country in a convenient bank account that will be provided by you before we can put
the funds into use in your country. For this, you shall be considered to have executed a contract
for the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in Nigeria for which payment should be effected to you
by the Ministry, The contract sum of which shall run into US$17.4 Million, of which your share
shall be 20% if you agree to be our overseas agent.

As soon as payment is effected, and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred into your
account, we intend to use our own share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this too you shall
also serve as our agent. In the light of this,

I would like you to forward to me the following information:
1. Your company name and address if any
2. Your personal fax number
3. Your personal telephone number for easy
communication.You are requested to communicate your acceptance of this proposal through my above
stated email address after which we shall discuss in details the modalities for seeing this
transaction through.
Your quick response will be highly appreciated.

Thank you in anticipation of your cooperation.
Yours faithfully,
DR.DAVID JONES.

PLEASE REPLY ONLY TO MY PRIVATE EMAIL ID (djones2005@o2.pl)
