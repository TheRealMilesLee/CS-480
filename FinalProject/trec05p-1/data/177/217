Special Greeting


Subject: PRESIDENTIAL BUSH'S SPECIAL CHRISTMAS GREETING


     
      "Christmas is a time of wonder and joy, of generosity and peace, that brings family and friends together in celebration and song. We sing old hymns and familiar carols, we show love for others in the giving of gifts, and we observe the hallowed traditions that make the season special. This year in the midst of extraordinary times, our Nation has shown the world that though there is great evil, there is a greater good. Americans have given of themselves, sacrificing to help others and showing the spirit of love and sharing that is so much a part of the Christmas season.

      According to the Gospel of Luke, two thousand years ago, the savior of mankind came into the world. Christians believe that Jesus' birth was the incarnation of God on earth, opening the door to new hope and eternal life.    
      At Christmastime, Christians celebrate God's love revealed to the world through Christ. And the message of Jesus is one that all Americans can embrace this holiday season -- to love one another.

      This Christmas we remember those who are without their loved ones. They continue to be in our hearts and prayers. May they experience peace, and may they find hope. And as we again celebrate Christ's birth, may the glorious light of God's goodness and love shine forth from our land.

      Laura joins me in wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. May God's blessings of peace be upon us and upon the world."

      GEORGE W. BUSH

      Our President understands and 
      believes in the real meaning of Christmas.  
      Feel free to forward his meaningful Christmas 
      greeting to all of your friends and loved ones
