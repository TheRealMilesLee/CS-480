Good Morning,

I pray that all is well with you this morning. I wanted to share a
prophetic word with you on this morning that went forth after our Building
Fund committee meeting last night. (As shared with me by our First Lady,
Edith Wallace).

Bro Andrew shared a word that we as a people are to follow our Moses that
God has given us and that God is calling all things to order. He stated
that when the Pastor speaks and gives a word of instructions, we are to
listen and stop bickering amongst ourselves like the children of Israel and
follow the man of God.

He, Bro Andrew stated that God said that if we as a church would unite and
pray for the Pastor and his wife for the next 21 days at 3:00 and everyone
be on one accord, God said that He would move mightily.

This will be shared in an announcement on Sunday to let the
church know, this would be in line of things and that the church needs to
get to a point of obedience, because one of the reason why the church has
gone around the mountain is because things have been out of order.

God is an awesome God and we want to give Him thanks for what He doing.
Please forward this information to as many people with contact information
before Sunday. Because this is something that we as a people can begin
doing today and share the Word with the congregation on Sunday.

Have a wonderful God Blessed Day,
Denise
