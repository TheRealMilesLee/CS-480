Much truth in this rapier thrust of humor.  As I continue to reflect on events, rumors and speculations, it strikes me that the Enron story seems to be unfolding as a story that is all about a kind of Rogue upper management thing.  The traditional fear of rogue trading, where a trader has control of the back office and spins off into a series of trades, each one designed to offset a previous bad one until the whole house of cards tumbles down,  this prototypical risk was carefully managed at Enron.  We actually have a very high quality trading business with good legal, accounting and settlement processes in place.  What we didn't have covered was a king of rogue financial sorcery thing by the very top executives.  Rogue balance sheet shenanigans  seems to be the problem.  It is a kind of corruption that is difficult to isolate and purge ourselves of.  Instead of isolating a single bad guy and firing him and then telling everybody all is well, this   kind of corruption seems to call for a  revolution from below, or, as seems increasingly likely, a takeover from without.   ----cgy

Enron Venture Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/ equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company.  The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.
