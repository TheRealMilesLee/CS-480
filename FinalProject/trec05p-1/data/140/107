Steve, I am interested in being on the transition team.  I was on the team at Minute Maid when Coca-Cola was selling 50% of the company to Proctor and Gamble.  Although the deal fell through in the end (after I had left), it allowed me to gain a vast array of knowledge regarding the merging of two companies, their benefits and their employees.  One of my major duties was looking at adverse impact and comparison of benefits to ensure that employees would be "whole" when the deal was finalized.  I was also the liaison for Minute Maid during Coca-Cola's class action lawsuit.  If you have any additional questions regarding my experience, please do not hesitate to call me at x51580 or at home 281.880.6615.
