Subject: [Footballguys] Breaking News - Fred Taylor Told to Stay Out Of Lineup

Entire story:
http://www.sportsline.com/u/ce/multi/0,1329,4560008_59,00.html

Clipped from the Jay Glazer article on CBS Sportsline:

One week after Miami-based specialist Dr. John Uribe recommended that Colts'
running back Edgerrin James undergo season-ending knee surgery, the doctor
recommended that another star back is not yet ready to return to action.

SportsLine.com has learned that Jaguars running back Fred Taylor met with
the specialist Tuesday morning and was told that his injured groin is still
not healed. Taylor has been practicing the past three weeks and the Jaguars
had hoped he would have been back in the lineup already. However, he has
been unable to run full speed and now comes word that he will continue be
sidelined.

"Dr. Uribe said he has a major injury and that after eight weeks, it's still
not healed and is going to take some more time getting healthy," Taylor's
agent Drew Rosenhaus said. "He wasn't sure specifically how much time Fred
would miss but it's a major tear, he tore the groin muscle off the bone. Dr.
Uribe said this is the type of injury that could often take a minimum of
three months before it is healed."

Taylor injured the groin in the first half of the team's second game of the
year. He made a cut in the middle of the field and suddenly stopped, let go
of the ball and dropped.

"It's going to be very unfair for anyone to assume he will play any time in
the immediate future," said Rosenhaus. "He's just not healthy yet. He can't
run full speed without tremendous pain. The Jaguars have done a very good
job in working him but he's still in pain.

"It's not just the groin but he also has pain in the hip now, which is an
off-shoot of the groin. But he's still healing and he shouldn't play at this
time and when the Jaguars talk to him later today, I'm sure they'll have the
same feeling."

In Taylor's absence, the Jaguars have played musical chairs in the
backfield. Stacey Mack has been the primary replacement, but youngsters
Frank Moreau and Elvis Joseph have also been given shots. Mack started
Sunday's game and will likely remain with the first team in the immediate
future.

"He's doing everything he can to get back in as soon as possible," said the
Florida-based agent. "Remember, we entered the season primed to play and
receive a big contract extension so nobody wants in there more than Fred.

"But the doctor recommends that he is progressing at a good pace and it
depends on how the injury heals. He said he has seen guys miss an entire
season with this. But at the same time, it's such a vague injury. Fred may
wake up next week and suddenly feel great. At the same time, it could take
several weeks. We don't know. We only know he's healing but shouldn't play
at this time."

This makes sense as the Jaguars have been very vague about Taylor's health.
Clearly, bad news for Taylor owners.   Stacey Mack and Elvis Joseph get an
extension but they've come up pretty small so far.   As Dr. Coshal, our
Footballguys.com Team Doc mentioned way back when Taylor was injured, this
is a serious deal.   Stay tuned but for now it's not looking good.

Thanks to Footballguy Jeff White for pointing me to this one.
