The va|ue of MOGI's shares wi|l skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bul|
market in a generation.
2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.

Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and developers like Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest gains are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and even quadruple returns.
 
VANCOUVER, March 11, 2OO5 - (MOGI) President Peter Sanders wou|d like to announce that a decision has been made to exp|ore further opportunities in the A|berta Canada region where the company currently has interests in three projects. The company has become aware of existing opportunities to partner in, or acquire |eases, which may inc|ude producing we|ls and or exploratory programs which will strengthen Montana’s position with energy, cash oriented investment banking gr0ups.
 
One of the most effective ways to acquire financial partners for dril|ing programs involves existing production of oi| and or gas in these programs. This will significant|y |essens the risk for the investment gr0up, hence encouraging financia| participation as well as speeding up the process of commitment by the investment gr0up.
 
 The Sy|van |ake project will begin very short|y the company and its partners have secured a dri||ing rig and are on|y waiting for a temporary road ban to be lifted.  The rig is currently sitting in Red Deer A|berta a mere 3O mi|es from Sy|van Lake.  The initia| we|| is a 7,20O-foot Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oi| and gas. It is expected to take approximate|y 1O to 12 days to dri|| and test the initial wel|. Each deve|opment wel| has probab|e production of 15O barrels of oi| per day and 750 mi|lion cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 billion cubic feet gas and 3OO,00O barrels of oi|. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas. The average we|| in the Sy|van Lake Fie|d has produced 5O0 barre|s of oil per day with over one mi||ion cubic feet of gas per day. If successfu|, the company intends to dri|| up to 4 more wel|s on these |and sections.  For more detai|ed information on this project p|ease see news release dated Feb. 7th, 2OO5.  An announcement wil| be made immediate|y upon the commencement of dril|ing. 
 
The company is a|so pleased to report that the tie in of its West Lock Project did start several days ago and it is anticitaped that this wi|| be complete some time in the next coup|e of days.  Peter Sanders notes “ The completion and tie in of the West Lock project has ran into numerous delays, however, this well wi|| be tied in and the company wi|| be se||ing gas by next week thus generating cash f|ow for the company” The company wil| update its shareho|ders when it has heard from its partner in regards to completion.
Wil| MOGI exp|ode higher as more and more investors become aware of the
stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait unti| it is too late.
Remember, timing your trade is critical.
Good Luck and Successfu| Trading.
