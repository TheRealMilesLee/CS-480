Handcrafted Maine Balsam
___________________________


This holiday season why not fill someone's home with the 
classic fragrance of balsam, fresh from the Maine woods? 
Just after Thanksgiving, we'll send your orders for 
wreaths, centerpieces and other decorations--handcrafted 
from newly-harvested balsam--to family members, friends 
and coworkers, so they'll be able to enjoy the essence of 
a traditional New England holiday at the season's start.

To place your balsam order today,
