Gentlemen,

What's happening with the above deal ? The term is 11/01/01 - 03/31/02, I can see the volume has been changed to 0 - is this only temporarily or has this deal been killed ?
We show this deal as Pending and I wanted to remind you that we have never confirmed this transaction. Please advise.

Regards,
Ellen
