Debra,

Regarding the above refenced GISB amendment which I brought up to you this morning (i.e. the amendment with insufficient legal language), here is the contact information:

Shary Walsh Mckay, Contract Manager
E-mail: sharyn.walsh-mcakay@PSEG.com
Phone: (973) 430-6825
Fax #: (973) 623-0328


I also heard from Kim Gentle of Avista Energy, Inc. this morning.  They are the ones who sent back the amendment with the signature line missing.  She said she had talked with you and you were going to mail her an executed amendment for her to sign but she has not yet received it.  She said the signature line seems to get cut off when the amendment is sent to her electronically.   Her phone # is (509) 495-4055 and e-mail address is kgentle@avistaenergy.com.
