Stephen and Steve.
 
Please note the email sent to Virginia below requesting  additional information for this meeting.  
 
I had hoped to discuss the following budget items with Kevin and Tim tuesday at 12:00-1:00 prior to our PM budget meeting.
 
Steve the budget attached is quite different from the rough one that was presented to our team several weeks ago.
 
Also after reviewing it further I have a few questions and sujested changes.
 
East desk markets went from 3.6 to 4.1 million?  Also with the recent FERC delays would we not be wise to only look at half a years spend starting in June when it will be clearer what is comming or will we use this money to build our strategic system?
 
Power Architecture went from 2.6 to 3.1 million?  How do we allocate this amongst east, west and cdn offices. 
 
Intraday P&L will likely be canceled at 2,2 million.
 
The real time workbench and services tools project can be reduced to service tools only.  This should reduce the cost in half from 1500 to 700K.
 
Global meter who is the sponsor?  PMI the east has 2 dedicated staff 400k not 1.7 million.
 
EMS and CA services.  In the east we have sold our CA's and have 2 dedicated staff plus a part time consulant (4-6 months) , costs for this item should be 3-400k rather than 1.2 million?
 
Risk tools needs some scope to justify the $1.6 million especially with dove and global valuation projects on the table.  We could easily shut down our efforts until these other projects ramp up.
 
Power Fundamental maintenance of 6.6 million seems large, please review?  Gas maintenance is only 600K ?  Also how much is east, west and cdn costs for this item.
 
Do you have any background on the market inteligence initatives web site?
 
Thanks.

Will you be providing additional information to support these numbers before the meeting on your per person costs and how we are charged overhead etc.
 
Also why only the numbers in the blue.  We have not agreed to the rest?  I have also seen numbers that are quite different and several of these projects are not required as well as some are overpriced.
 
Also how will the allocation between east, west and canada be done for these single line items.
 
Thanks.
