For Tuesday -

STWBOM will be short 75 mw on peak @ SP15. The short is related to three day-ahead pieces which were sold @ $27.20, $28, and $27.11.

Make real time purchases to cover the short under the STWHOURLY book. Enter an inter-desk sale from STWHOURLY to STWBOM. Then make a sale under the STWBOM book to the Cal-Imbalance to complete the deal.

Please let me know if you have questions.
