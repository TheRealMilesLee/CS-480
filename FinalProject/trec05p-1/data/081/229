The person that I was talking to at Dynegy left. What was the problem with the original grty? Did they not make the initial changes that Gerald wanted?

What about the AES NewEnergy, Inc Enfolio?

 I am waiting on revisions to the Dynegy Holdings, Inc. Gty.  So if you can push on these folks it would be great.  I have sent the final draft to Nicor Energy, LLC today for their review.  The Nicor Gty is ok.
