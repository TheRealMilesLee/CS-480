Louise:

Please keep in mind that as soon as FERC approval is received (which is expected in approx. 30 days), the statement below will no longer be true as the sale of our interest in Doyle to Walton EMC will become effective.

"Enron owns a 50 percent interest in Doyle I, LLC, an approximate 350 MW peaker plant in Walton County, Georgia."

Let me know if you need anything else. See you at our meeting at 10 am tomorrow.

Regards,
