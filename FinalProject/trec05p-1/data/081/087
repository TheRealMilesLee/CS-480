What do you think about this?  It seems to me that, while I don't at this
point vote either way, there is another factor in the equation that I don't
see mentioned.  What if you also  hypothesize that those identified people
are going to die anyway?  We have pretty good evidence that some of the
people on the plane that went down in Pennsylvania were thinking this way.
