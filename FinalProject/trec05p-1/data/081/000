                    FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: Except for historical
                    information contained herein, the statements on this website
                    and newsletter are forward-looking statements that are made
                    pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private
                    Securities Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements
                    involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may
                    cause a company's actual results in the future periods to
                    differ materially from forecasted results. These risks and
                    uncertainties include, among other things, product price
                    volatility, product demand, market competition and risk
                    inherent in the companies operations. You can identify these
                    statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to
                    historical or current facts. They use words such as
                    ``anticipate,'' ``estimate,'' ``expect,'' ``project,''
                    ``intend,'' ``plan,", "anticipate",
                    "guess", "think", "hear",
                    "suggest", ``believe,'' and other words and terms
                    of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of
                    future operating or financial performance.</span><font face="Arial"><o:p>

                    a suggestion, "Never, ever, make an investment based
                    solely on what you read in an online newsletter or Internet
                    bulletin board, especially if the investment involves a
                    small, thinly-traded company that isn't well known,"
                    said Nancy M. Smith, Director of SEC's Office of Investor
                    Education and Assistance. "Assume that the information
                    about these companies is not trustworthy unless you can
                    prove otherwise through your own independent research."
