Thanks.  I've sent you the NGPL presentation.  Nothing Earth shattering, but you may find some of the expansion & storage info interesting.

Here are my cryptic notes from the PEPL class:

The field area of PEPL is considered to be everything upstream of Haven

Haven is considered to be the demarcation between Field and Market area on PEPL

PEPL mainline divided into 100 mile marker segments

Two legs in the field area---Liberal and Seiling and/or Elk City (named after the Elk City Plant)

Liberal historically has been a constrained area, but has seen alot of non-constraints as of the last couple of years due to the strength in the West, as well as production declines in the area

For anyone trading PEPL cash, etc, it is important to watch the spreads b/t Rockies,  CIG, TW and PEPL--for instance the variable rate to move CIG into PEPL is roughly nine cents.  The fuel is 2.67%

Another big point that frequently gets constrained is CIG Lakin--point flows roughly around 175,000 MMBtu/d


Field Storage - there are actually two storage facilities in the PEPL field area, although PEPL considers field storage to be at Haven, Haven is traded as a field point

Greensburg off of NNG is another major supply area on PEPL--called Mullinville on the NNG side, it is called bi-directional, but most likely can be done by displacement only

Tuscola - is the interconnect between Trunkline/PEPL interconnect

Lebanon - often constrained

Also talked about not being able to drop off at multiple delivery points on PEPL--unlike ML7
