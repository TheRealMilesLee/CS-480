Theresa,

The formula BP is using is highlighted in red below. After I inquired about the discrepancy, my counterpart at BP emailed her trader who talked to Paul Lucci. Apparently, BP is using the correct pricing. I just faxed copies of the invoices to you.

Thanks,
Genaro

Just spoke with Paul Lucci at Enron.  He agrees that they are not showing
the correct equation.  Mine is correct.  His accountant will get back into
the office tomorrow to make corrections.  Let me know if you do not hear
from them in the next couple of days.

	Janice-

	Good morning.  I have a price discrepancy for deal 120644/120643,
Anschutz Plant, for 8/01 and 9/01 (and if it is not corrected, we could have
a discrepancy for as long as the deal lasts, until 4/02).  Enron is showing
the rate to be Inside FERC NWPL Rockies + $0.02 less $0.09 (Mcf conversion).
In ET Deal our formula is (NWPL Rocky Mountains IF) + .02 - ((1.022-.995) *
(Kern Wyoming IF)).

	Can you please verify who is correct, and if Enron's rate is
correct, can you please make the changes for 8/01, 9/01 and the continuing
months in the deal?  If we are correct, can you please talk to your
counterpart at Enron to see about getting this resolved this month?  My
counterpart and I would both like to have this rate discrepancy cleared this
month.

	Please let me know if you need any additional information.  Thank
you for all your help.

	Thanks-
