ATTN: THE PRESIDENT/CHAIRMAN


DEAR SIR/MADAM, 
                         
                     STRICTLY CONFIDENCIAL


My name is CHRISTIAN EKENE, the elder son of Mr. JOHN
EKENE of Zimbabwe. This might be a surprise to you
about where I got your contact address. I got your e-mail address from the companies search in internet in Johannesburg, South Africa. 

During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe
from the supports of our President Robert Mugabe to
claim all the white-owned farms to his party members
and his followers, he ordered all white farmers to
surrender all their farms to his party members and
hisfollowers. 
My father is one of the best farmers in our country
and because he did not support Mugabe's ideas,
Mugabe's supporters invaded my father's farm and 
burnt everything in the farm, killing my father and
made away with a lot of items in my father's farm. 

Before his death, my father had deposited with one of
the Security Company in Johannesburg, South Africa the
sum of US$18. 5 Million (Eighteen Million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). After the
death of my father, we decided to move to the Republic
of South Africa where he had deposited the money in
the Security Company as valuables. 

So I decided to contact overseas firm and companies
that will assist me to move this money out of South
Africa because as asylum seekers we are not 
allowed to operate any bank account within South
Africa. We have agreed to offer you 20% of the total
sum for your assistance, 5% will be mapped out 
for any expenses that may be incurred in the course of
this transaction and 75% will be for me and my
familyto invest in your country. 

All I want you to do is to furnish me with your entire
personal phone and fax numbers for easy communication.
You can contact me on the above Telephone and fax
numbers. Note that this transaction is 100% risk free
and absolutely confidential. 


Thanks and God bless. 

Regards, 
CHRISTIAN EKENE.
