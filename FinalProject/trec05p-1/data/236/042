   Word of the Day for Saturday February 23, 2002:

   sybarite \SIB-uh-ryt\, noun:
   A person devoted to luxury and pleasure.

     This  worldly  cleric, nicknamed "the sybarite of Saumane",
     friend  of  Voltaire  and  a  social  luminary in Paris and
     Avignon,   lived  a  high  old  life  within  the  medieval
     fortifications of his chateau in Provence.
     --"The  dubious  charms  of  Citizen Sade," [1]Irish Times,
     April 17, 1999

     Beneath   the   prudish   disapproval  that  colored  Upton
     Sinclair's assessment of California's wealthy sybarites was
     an  amused  astonishment  at how hard they worked at having
     fun, at how deadly serious they were about pleasure.
     --Richard  White,  "What California taught America," [2]The
     New Republic, December 1, 1997

     And  when  the  final  blessing  of  a  perfect French cook
     appeared  to  make our domestic picture complete, we became
     utter  sybarites, frank worshippers of the splendors of the
     French cuisine.
     --Samuel Chamberlain, [3]Clémentine in the Kitchen
     _________________________________________________________

   Sybarite  is  derived  from  Greek Sybarites, from Sybaris, an
   ancient  Greek  city noted for the luxurious, pleasure-seeking
   habits of many of its inhabitants.
