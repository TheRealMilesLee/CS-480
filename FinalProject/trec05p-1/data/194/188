DOLLARS IN A DORMANT ACCOUNT WHICH MY COLLEAGUES AND I NOW WANT TO

IN ANY CASE YOUR INTEREST WILL BE PROPERLY TAKEN CARE OF.

MEANWHILE, MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE DECIDED TO SHARE THE MONEY IN THE 
FOLLOWING RATIO: 65% FOR MY COLLLEAGUES AND I, THEN 30% FOR YOU THE 
ACCOUNT OWNER AND 5% FOR ALL LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL EXPENSES THAT MAY 
ARISE IN THE COURSE OF THIS TRANSACTION.

FUTHER DETAILS ABOUT THIS TRANSACTION WILL BE DISCUSSED IN THE 
SUBSEQUENT CORRESPONDENCE. THIS TRANSACTION IS STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 
BUT 100% RISK FREE. NOTE ALSO THAT THE PARTICULAR NATURE OF YOUR
