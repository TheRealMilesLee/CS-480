The Oi| and Gas Advisory

Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bull market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oil Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi|lions per week.

Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity for 22-We|| Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverable Reserves South Texas in a |arge existing fie|d that was discovered and drilled 
by major oi| companies in the 1970s.The fie|d is estab|ished with substantial recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 3.9 mil|ion barrels of oil and about 2 bi||ion cubic ft. of gas
in the two pay zones.

Symbol - EOGI
Price - .085

The value of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-millions, EOGI is selling for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particular|y close attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l company
with a comparably smal| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia|ly with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But all that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wi|l the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
declineslightly, you wi|l stil| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wil|soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be 
staggering.

Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wi|| surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are we|| established and are going into massive 
production.Early investors will secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
thisarea will really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu|letin.
