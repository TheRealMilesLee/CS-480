This project has been noticed by FERC (CP01-422).  Adds 906,626 dth/day (845,500 Mcf) of capacity from Opal, WY to delivery points primarily in California.  Service commencing 5/1/2003.  Incremental rates and fuel.   Seventeen shippers have signed 18 long-term agreements (10 or 15 years) and 95% has primary delivery points in California, mostly for existing and new power generation.

Any issues?  Are we a shipper?  Comments and interventions are due Aug. 29th.  Since I will be in D.C. that week, need your input by Aug. 23rd.
