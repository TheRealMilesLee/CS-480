Our lozenges are only like normal lozenges but they 
are especially formulated to be pliable and dissolvable
under the lingua. The tablets is sorbed at the oral cavity
and goes into the fluid direct rather of proceeding
through the stomach. This results in a faster more
vigorous outcome which even up to 22 hours!
