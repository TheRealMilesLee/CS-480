FROM THE DESK OF:
MR EDMUND HERMANN
LONDON
Email:edmund_hermann@box.az

Dear Friend,

Firstly, this is not to cause you embarrassment, I am Mr  Edmund Hermann, a 
personal friend and business associate to late Mr. Mark Michelle(untill his 
death) a National of France, who used to be a private contractor with the 
Shell Petroleum Development Company in Saudi Arabia, herein after shall be 
referred to as my Friend. On the 21st of May 2002, he and his wife with their 
three children were involved in an auto crash, all occupants of the vehicle 
unfortunately lost their lives.

Since then, I have made several enquiries with his country embassies to 
locate any of his extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. 
After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to contact you with this 
proposal.

I am have contacting you to assist in repatriating this huge amount of money 
left behind by my friend before the Bank get it confiscated or declared 
unserviceable by the BANK/INSTITUTION where these huge deposit is lodged.

The deceased had a deposit presently valued USD21 million which I am aware of 
and the BANK has issued to his persoanl attorney a notice to provide his next 
of kin or Beneficiary by WILL otherwise have the account confisticated within 
the next thirty official working days.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 2 years now 
as well as the attorney, I therefore seek your consent to present you as the 
next of kin / Will Beneficiary to the deceased so that the proceeds of this 
account valued at USD21 Million can be paid to you.

Don't worry how this is going to be done. If you give me your williness to do 
this with me, I will have to give you the contact informations of the 
attorney, so that you can contact him directly, presenting your self to him 
as the relative of his late client. And the attorney will now present you to 
the bank as the next of Kin and then,the proceedings for the transfer will 
commence .

This will be disbursed or shared in these percentages, 55% for me 30% to 
you,10% for charity organizations while the balance 5% will be set aside for 
any expences.

All I require is your honest Co-operation, Confidentiality and Trust to 
enable us see this transaction through.I guarantee you that this will be 
executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach 
of the law. 

I am presently in London and I ask for your cooperation to provide me the 
following information:

1. Your full name

2. your telephone/mobile and fax numbers

3. your physical Address.

Your urgent response will be highly anticipated and appreciated. 

Please contact me on my private email address; 

edmund_hermann@box.az

whether or not you are interested in assisting me.
This will enable me make alternative plans, in the
event of non-interest on your part.


Best regards,

Mr  Edmund Hermann
