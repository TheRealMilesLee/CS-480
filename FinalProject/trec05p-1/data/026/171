I will actually be on a plane to Houston at that time.  Either Jeff Richter or Gordon Savage should be able to fill in for me, or we can do it at a different time.  In the latter case, I would suggest either 11 AM PDT/1 PM CDT (I can call in from the airport) or 4PM PDT/6 PM CDT (again, I can call from the airport, assuming flight is on time).  My preference would be 4/6 to allow more time to firm up numbers, but I realize it could push us a little late into the evening, depending on how efficient we are. :)
