Howard, 
Can you please respond to Daren's question?   Howard after we talked I thought you were going to just make the change effective 6/2001.  Even if they do add these meters to the deals ENA does not have a transport contract on Unit to sell the gas to Entex.

We haven't had those meters on these deals for the entire year.  Why do we need to add them on the last month we have the deal?

Sherlyn, 
The POPS meters 7107, 7108, and 7109 need to stay non allocatable and need to be allocated on Unit Gas Pipeline. You will need Daren or Michael at Enron to do the following 
Add Meters 7107, 7108 and 7109 on Unit Pipeline to Sitara Deals             70550 
                                                                                                                                           70549 
                                                                                                                                            70119 
Then you can run the POPS 53 report for these meters or use your allocation to properly allocate to the meters on Unit Pipeline. 
Once this is done, Let me know and I will zero out the POPS meters. 
HC
