	On Friday, I spoke with Dave Lund about the case referenced above.  According to David, to the extent this is a personal injury matter and, therefore, an insurance claim, Bob Vote is the guy to manage it.  In fact, Bob is already aware of the matter and on top of it.
	Bob, can you confirm that you are the right person to handle this and that you are on it? If there is anything I need to do, please let me know.  Thanks.
