New Deepwater Gulf Gas Discovery
 
Kerr-McGee announced a new discovery of natural gas in their Redhawk
prospect in Garden Banks block 877 of the deepwater gulf.  Drilled to
over 23,000 feet in 5,400 feet of water, this new discovery encountered
more than 135 feet of gas and gas condensate in two zones.  Kerr-McGee
and Ocean Energy each own 50% of Redhawk.  Current estimates of reserves
in this prospect range between 300 and 500 BCF.  For more information
see http://www.kerr-mcgee.com/news2001/102201.html .

Salomon Forecast Cold Winter
This winter will likely rank in the top third of the coldest in history
for the US, according to the winter forecast by Salomon Smith Barney.
However, the odds do not point to an exceptionally cold winter, such as
one of the top 10 coldest, but that is not totally out of the question.
The forecast is based on a switch in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in
the northern Pacific Ocean from a warm phase for sea surface
temperatures, which tends to encourage mild winters, to a cold phase,
which raises the likelihood of a colder-than-normal winter. Combined
with neutral sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean in
a year that did not feature an El Nino or La Nina weather anomaly and an
adequate pool of cold air in the northern hemisphere, conditions are
similar to those prevailing before last winter. Last week, the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration winter forecast called for
temperatures to be colder than normal in the Northeast, Upper Midwest,
Great Lakes and Great Plains States, with heavy snow in many of the same
areas.
