After speaking with you and learning that ENE was down to $20/share, I had a family meeting last night when I got home.

Kim needs to pull in more income any way possible; The kids need to get after pre-school jobs; etc.

Quote of the day..."Are you guys on crack?"

I see you referenced Fort Union below, therefore these e-mails to Chris are concerning a well in the Powder River?

Thanks..

We should know something about the well we are currently reentering next week.  Timing on the gathering line is still uncertain.

These are draft versions of the interruptible purchase agreement and
confirm for your gas into Fort Union.  Think about what you what to do
for term, volume etc.  We will then add in the gathering charges.  We
are pretty flexible, so let me know what works for Patina.

Thanks,

Mark
