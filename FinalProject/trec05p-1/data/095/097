Here is a new press release that was issued this morning by the Cauley Geller firm:   http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/011023/cltu023_1.html

The Cauley Geller firm and Milberg Weiss are co-counsel.  As these press releases come out, it is important to remember that many counsel usually sign up on one case.  Therefore, the number of press releases does not equal the number of cases filed.

As an aside,  Dave Sharp called me this morning to chat.  He mentioned that he received "five or six" calls last week from counsel interested in filing securities fraud actions against Enron.  Needless to say, he deferred.

Also, Murray Fogler called.  He said that Tom Cunningham called him on another case and mentioned that he had just filed a 10b-5 case and a deriviative case against Enron.  Apparently, Cunningham is trying to get involved in some bigger cases.

The fun is on.
