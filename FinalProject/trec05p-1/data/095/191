We need to talk about his.  I've gone through several "wish lists" with them and received little or nothing back.  In one case, a project of theirs was giving out wrong information.  I shared my blunt thoughts with them today as they asked me for my latest wish list.  They couldn't give me a succinct, definitive status on my previous wish list, so I told them to finish or terminate all of the old stuff before we talk about new stuff.  

Since I never receive a price signal from these guys I have no idea what they are spending money on and who it is supposed to benefit.  I am currently receiving promises with no effective project management and little or nothing of value to show from their efforts on projects I have requested.
