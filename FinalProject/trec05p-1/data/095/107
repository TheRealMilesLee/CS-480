Path to greatness
+++++++++++++++++++

The challenges come, and you rise with determination to meet
those challenges. The result is that after the challenge passes,
you're better off than you were before.

A successful life is composed of a series of ever-increasing
challenges. Sustained achievement comes from stringing one challenge
after another, and then doing whatever it takes to transcend those
challenges.

Challenge forces you to raise your expectations. Challenge compels
you to put in extra effort. Challenge encourages you to learn more,
to become more effective, to be more focused and committed.

The challenges seem uncomfortable and unwelcome at first. Yet when
you eventually are able to look back on them, you'll clearly see
that each one makes you stronger and more capable.

What challenges do you face today? Imagine the best places they
can take you, and then make the effort necessary to get there.
Your challenges create your very own special path to greatness.

Ralph Marston
