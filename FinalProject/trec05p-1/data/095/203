Here is the link to the GISB, however trade has been terminated on this agreement as it was assigned last year to HPL prior to the sale.  Alisha Mahabir and I are currently negotiating a new GISB with MGI with some difficulty. Also concerning PMI Trading, at present I show only swap agreements with this company.  Marie Heard or Susan Bailey can assist you with swap agreements.  Please give me a call if you wish to discuss this further. I have asked Alisha to give you a call regarding MGI.
