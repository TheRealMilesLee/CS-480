Thanks Robin for the info.  We will get the GISB finalized so you can use it whenever you do need it.

christy,

i spoke with chip this morning.  he said it was highly unlikely that anything would happen this week.  i still want to follow through with the contract so we will be ready to transact if necessary.  the sense of urgency has changed.

thank you for your help!

Robin,

Just to let you know, we rehashed the GISB yesterday and sent our final comments to Occidental yesterday afternoon.  We have not heard back yet.  We needed to make sure we had provided for the fact you do not record, you want them to prepay, no netting,setoff, etc.  I also advised that ENA wanted to be the confirming party.  Hopefully we will hear from them soon as I am sure they want to start the ball rolling as soon as possible.

Will you need my help with confirmations?  I am glad to help you unless you have other sources, but we especially now need to have the written confirmations done, with the appropriate bankruptcy language.

Thanks again for your help.

Christy

Robin,

I have reviewed the GISB sent by Occi.  The GISB between Occi and EES does NOT contain the special provisions contained in the within GISB.  I can tell them we want the wording exactly the same, but we are dealing with different types of deals.

The main reason EES was able to negotiate them out, was EES did not record.  EES prefers to have a written confirmation, does Wholesale?

Paul, since Wholesale records, I would think that the second special provision would apply, and the first one certainly could or could not, depending upon whether this is the practice of Wholesale.  If this is merely Occidental's practice, then I will propose wording to change the reading to reflect that we do WANT all confirmations of less than one month to be confirmed.

The third special provision, can go either way, your call?

The fourth provision, seems fine, again your call?

Normally the pre-payment (by Occy) does not go in the actual GISB agreement.  I would like to have Carol Wilson insert our bankruptcy language right before the signatures on page one.

Also, I would suggest under confirming party on page one, that it read:  Enron Wholesale, unless you do not prefer to confirm, but I am pretty sure you do.

Let me know later.

Christy

Robin,

How are you doing?  It has been a few years since we've seen each other.
John Fitzpatrick asked that I send to you the GISB contract for your review.
If you will complete the information on the right-hand side of the first
page and email back to me I will prepare originals for execution.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

 <<GISB-new.DOC>>
