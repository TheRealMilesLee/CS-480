My Dear Friend,

Kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to you,i have choosen to call you my friend with best of hope that you will have a very kind heart so full of consciences,love considering human nature to be able to understand my situation and help me find a solution and rescue over this my incident because you seem to be my last hope for now.

I believe you are a highly respected personality considering a careful research which i have been able to make inrespect to your kind of person,before i decided to entrust this transactions and database in your country into your hands which i beleive you will not betray my trust and confidence already repossed on you.
 
Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in Liberia but it has formed consistent headlines in the CNN, BBC news bulletins.
My name is MATHEW NUHAN VAYE from Liberia,a Country in West
Africa.My Father is Issac Nuhan Vaye, Deputy Minister of Public Works,Liberia.

My Father was falsely accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT
OF LIBERIA (CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him. You can verify this from your country. You can also check in some of the international newspapers
posted in the web sites below:
(i) http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-07-15-liberia_x.htm
(ii)http://www.unwire.org/UNWire/20030716/449_6621.asp

Before my father was killed, he moved out the sum of $10.7million(Ten Million Seven Hundred Thousand US Dollars) through a diplomatic means, and deposited it with a
Security Company overseas.
 
My mother who is still under very strict suveillance by the security and government of my country had agreed that we look for a reliable trust worthy person who can help us out hence i decided to contact you.
 
At the moment am residing here in Spain in disquise in an ayslum camp and with my statues as an asylum,it does not permit to enter into such transaction of a huge magnitude otherwise i may be suspected and run into trouble which might result to my being deported back to LIBERIA.
 
 All that is needed is for you to agree in helping me then i shall give you vivid details through my lawyer to instruct the company to transfer the funds to your account, I will renumerate you with 30% at the end, but most of all is that I solicit your trust in this transaction i know this sounds too good to be true,but beleive me,that my you shall not in anyway be expossed to danger or ridicule because the continued existence of my family solely depends on ensuring that i get a partner who will truely assist me in securing the money in safe hands before it is been discovered and confisticated by the authorities of my country.

My mother ever since has been confined only to our country home and all her calls are being monitored,but you can always reach me personally on my mobil phone which i shall send across to you as soon as you indicate your interest,so for now i will advise you to contact me through my personal email address for confidential reasons(nuhanvaye_mat@yahoo.com
 
kindly include your private telephone and fax numbers/residential address where you can
always be reached if you are in the need to help me to enable me send detail information/documents to you.

Once more,i will appreciate you keep this information and transaction strictly confidential even if you are not interested to save me from the risk of running into trouble as this the only way i can cry out for help through any reasonable and responsible christian or devote muslism who will rescue my situation.

MAY GOD/ALLAH BLESS YOU.
Mathew Vaye.
