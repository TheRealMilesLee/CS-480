What is Vicodin used for?

Vicodin is the brand name for the popular painkiller, hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen.
Hydrocodone bitartrate is an opioid analgesic and antitussive, occurring as fine, white crystals
or, as a crystalline powder.
In the U.S. there are over 200 products containing hydrocodone, typically combined with acetaminophen 
(Vicodin, Lortab). However, it is also combined with aspirin (Lortab ASA), ibuprofen (Vicoprofen), 
and antihistamines (Hycomine). Both tablet and liquid forms of hydrocodone are available (Tussionex).
Other brand names include Anexsia, CoGesic, Hydrocet, Hy-Phen, Lorcet, Maxidone, Norco, Panacet, and Zydone.
Street names for Vicodin include vikes and hydros.

1.Background:

Hydrocodone dates back to the 1920's when Knoll, a German pharmaceutical company, believed hydrogenizing
codeine could make it less toxic, making it easier on the stomach. As its name implies, hydrocodone is the
codeine molecule with a hydrogen atom attached. During this time in the U.S., a disturbing percentage of middle
class Americans were hooked on opium derivatives. The government, anxious for a non-addictive painkiller,
gave extensive funding to research new compounds like hydrocodone.
 

2.Indications:

Vicodin is a phenathrene-derivate opiate agonist, effective both as an antitussive (anti-cough) agent, and as
an opiate, an effective analgesic for mild to moderate pain. Five mg of hydrocodone is equivalent to 30 mg of
codeine when administered orally. 15 mg (1/4 gr) of hydrocodone is considered equivalent to 10 mg (1/6 gr) of
morphine. Hydrocodone is considered to be like morphine in all respects.
 

3.Effects:

Vicodin is a semisynthetic narcotic analgesic and antitussive with multiple actions qualitatively similar to
those of codeine. Most of these involve the central nervous system and smooth muscle. The precise mechanism of
action of hydrocodone and other opiates is not known, although it is believed to relate to the existence of opiate
receptors in the central nervous system. In addition to analgesia, narcotics may produce euphoria; drowsiness;
lethargy; relaxation; difficulty in concentrating; decreased physical activity in some users and increased physical
activity in others; mild anxiety or fear, and pupillary constriction.

4.How can our prices be so low?:

We ship directly from FDA - approved manufacturer in India where the production costs are low.
The branded versions of the product are more expensive because other companies spend a lot on marketing.However,
our quality is the same as that of the branded drugs.Providing quality is where we spend our budget. We don't 
think that marketing is that important if the product works.Besides, there are no middlemen, when you buy directly
from the manufacturer.

All packages are shipped discreetly by Airmail WORLDWIDE.
