Dear Partner,

 You may be suprised to received this letter from me since you do not know
me personally.

 I am Zokolu Zabuanga the first son of Kuanzo Zabuanga ,the most popular =
farmer in zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country.I got =
your contact through network online hence deceided to write you.Before the =
death of my father he had taken me to johannesburg to deposite the sum of =
12.000000.00 dollars (twelve million dollars)in one of the private security =
company in South Africa, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe this =
money was deposited in a box as gemstones to avoid much dumorrage from the =
security company, this amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and =
chemicals for farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland.

This land problem came when Zimbabwean president.Mr Robert Mugabe
introduced a new land act reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and =
some black farmers,and this resulted to the killing and mob action by =
Zimbabweean war veterans and some lunatics in the society.Infact a lot of =
people were killed because of this land reform act for which my father was =
one of the victims and may his soul rest in perfect peace.

It is against this background that i and my family fled Zimbabwe for fear of =
our lives and are currently staying in the Nederlands where i am seeking for =
asylum and moreso have
deceided to trasfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account =
since the law of the Nederlands prohibits a refugee(asylum seeker) to open a =
bank account or to involve in any financial transaction throughout the =
territorial zone of the Nederlands,as the eldelst son of my father,I am =
saddled with the responsibilt of seeking a genuine foreign account where this =
money could be transferd without the knowledge of my goverment who are 
bent on taking everything we have got.

The south African government seems to be playing along with them,i am faced =
with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear =
of going through
the same experience in future,both countries have similar political history =
and as a business man i am seeking for a partner who i have to entrust my =
future and that of my family in his hands,i must let you know that this =
transcation is risk free,if you accept to assit me and my family, all i want =
you to do for me isto make arrangements with security company to clear the =
consignment (funds)from their afilate office here in the Nederlands as i have =
already giving dirctives for the consignments to be brought to the Nederlands =
from South Africa but 
before then all modalities will be put in place like the change of ownership =
to the consignmen(funds)and more importantly this money i intend to use for =
investments.

I have two options for you,firstly you can choose to have certain percentage =
of the money for 
nominating your account for this transaction ,or you can go into partnership =
with me for a proper profitable investment of the money in your country,which =
ever the option you want
please feel free to notify me,i have also mapped out 5% of this money for all =
kind of expences incurred in this process of this transaction.

If you do not prefer a partnership i am willing to give you 15% of the total =
sum while the remaning 80% will  be for me and my family also for the =
investment in your country.Contact me
with the above email address while i implore you to maintain the absolute =
secrecy required in this transaction till we put claims to the consignment =
(funds).

PLEASE REPLY TO MY PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS:zokolu1@netscape.net

Thanking you,and GOD bless you.
Your's Truely ,
Zokolu Zabuanga.
