Dear Sir/Madam,
Season Greetings. 
I wish to solicit for you kind understanding accepting to read my mail which =
may come as a surprise to you. I am Reni James Makamba, the wife of the =
managing director of Kestrel Corporation and head of Telecel Zimbabwe , one =
of the biggest and telecommunication networks in Zimbabwe. I am speaking from =
my country Zimbabwe, pleading for your assistance to help my family by =
providing accommodation for a consignment which I want to send aboard few =
days from now, the real content will be made know to you upon agreement for =
fear of seizure by the government of President Robert Mugabe  who have =
subjected my husband, businessmen and politician to constant  detention  =
since February last year after hearing of his intention of taking part in the =
forth coming election which we hope must see this government who both the =
international communities have seen as a dictator and racist out of power. 
I just needed a foreign friend/business partner to act as the owner of the =
consignment which i will label as telecommunication consignment to avoid any =
trace whatsoever from this government who have decided to detain my husband =
and my very self under constant check-up.  
Sir/Madam, to avoid any further problem for me, communicating with me can =
only be possible through email. And after receiving this consignment, i will =
direct you on what to do.
Please do not take my mail very offensive as i deliberately need your kind =
attention and support. 
News of his arrest can be read from here
