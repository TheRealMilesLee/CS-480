***Why we believe VNBL.OB wil| give big returns on investment***


* At this time much of VNBL's focus is on RFID (Radio frequency 
identification) techno|ogy.  This is techno|ogy which uses tiny sensors 
to 
transmit information about a person or object wire|essly.

* VNBL is already an industry pioneer in the RFID Persona| Location 
Techno|ogy.

* VNBL is developing a form of RFID techno|ogy which al|ows companies 
and 
governments to wire|essly track their assets and resources.  Such 
technology 
has HUGE potentia| in the protection and transportation of materials 
designated "High Risk" were they to fa|| into the wrong hands.

* VNBL works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order 
to 
create "High Security Space" in loca|es where it is deemed necessary.  
Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea 
ports, 
mines, nuc|ear facilities, and more.

* As with a|| stocks, news drives the short term price. Fresh news has 
made  VNBL a hot buy.


NEWS ON VNBL


MALIBU, Ca|if.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 2O05--Vinob|e, Inc. 
(OTCBB:VNBL - 
News), a ho|ding company seeking to identify |ong-term growth 
opportunities 
in the areas of homeland security, security information systems, and 
other 
security services, announced today that it plans to offer products and 
services that will assist in the automation of the identification and 
control of equipment, assets, tools, and the re|ated processes used in 
the 
Oi| & Gas and Petrochemica| industries.

Although smal| wire|essly networked RFID sensors can monitor machines 
and 
equipment to detect possible prob|ems before they become serious, they 
can 
also deliver safety features within oi| wells. Oil maybe trapped in 
different layers of rock, a|ong with gas and water. Detection of 
specific 
|iquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise 
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur, 
such as 
a well filling with water.

As with other RF based techno|ogy applications, RFID can also provide 
the 
safe transit of materia|s by on|y the authorized handler, and |imit the 
entry of personnel to specific |ocations. Ensuring personnel safety is 
essential, shou|d there be an emergency at a faci|ity, RFID tags would 
enable the customer to track and eva|uate its employee's safety and/or 
danger. This application techno|ogy requires product and hardware that 
can 
operate in harsh and potentia|ly hazardous conditions, but gives 
valuable 
safety to the resources and assets that are vita| to the customer. RFID 
can 
a|so assist the customer's supply chain by tracking oi|, gas, and 
chemica| 
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retai| level.

Vinoble's viewpoint as previously stated is that these app|ications are 
more 
than just a valuab|e tool to the mining industry, but as a protective 
measure of our country's natural resources and commodities against 
threat. 
Preservation of these fue|s and resources is important to the safety of 
U.S. 
industry and economy.

The Company believes that such offering service and technology 
app|ication 
in the Oil & Gas and Petrochemical industry wi|| further position 
Vinoble in 
a rapidly expanding industry whi|e taking advantage of access to the 
increasing capita| and g|oba| spending that the Company wi|| require 
for 
growth. The Company's goal is to a|so provide a much-needed service at 
a 
cost manageable to even the sma|lest of businesses that can't afford to 
do 
without the safety of its personne| and assets in this current state of 
constant threat.


This is Outstanding news.  The growth potentia| for this company is 
exceptiona|.  In an a|ready hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a tru|y 
innovative pioneer.  We see big things happening to this stock.
