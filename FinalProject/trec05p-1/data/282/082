INVITATION 

You are welcome to attend our FLOWEXPO! 

FLOWEXPO , which is International Exhibition on Fluid Engineering ang Process Industry , was founded in March,1997. We can attend this expo once a year at GUANGZHOU . The Expo date is the last Wednesday in March every year, and it will last 3 days. 

The following main exhibit products will be included in FLOWEXPO: Valves, Actuators,Pipings,Fittings, Pumps, Seals,compressors,Fluid Machinery,process equipment, Instrumentation ,Automation & control Systems . We will invite our audience from all kinds of trades such as petrol and chemistry, petrol-making, energy resources, electric power, pulping 밃 paper-making, pharmacy, foodstuff, drinks, beer, light-industry, construct material 밃 mining, metallurgy, water-supplying, steam-supplying, heat-supplying, environment-protecting, water-handling, industry equipment installing project, the long pipeline of petrol and natural gas project, architecture 목 water-supplying and draining 목 air condition 목 fire-fighting 목 gas-installed project and so on. 

Since FLOWEXPO was founded, over one thousand suppliers have been attracted to attend our exhibition, most of them come from more than 20 countries and areas such as America, Germany, French, Italy, Australia, Canada, Japan, Denmark 밃 Spanish, Norway, Korea, Singapore and so on. Many people in the profession sing high praise for our exhibition with "special exhibition, corresponding audience and remarkable effect ", so more than one hundred famous newspaper presses, special magazines, trade websites and sponsoring institutions gave us great propagation and support. At the same time, the sponsoring institutions , together with Chinese concerned departments and guild, organized some famous experts from home to abroad to have technology lectures, and invited design institutions, project corporations, installing companies, imports and exports companies, business institutions, associations and academies to visit, make purchase and communicate. 

FLOWEXPO will provide you with good favor in exploiting market and seeking commerce opportunity! We can make sure that our exhibition will achieve greater effect , both the businessman and audience this year! 

If you want to book our showcase 밃 please apply for it in advance; if you want to visit our exhibition ,you are welcome to register. Please contact with us as soon as possible.
