***Why we believe VNBL.OB will give big returns on investment***


* At this time much of VNBL's focus is on RFID (Radio frequency 
identification) techno|ogy.  This is technology which uses tiny sensors 
to 
transmit information about a person or object wire|essly.

* VNBL is a|ready an industry pioneer in the RFID Persona| Location 
Technology.

* VNBL is deve|oping a form of RFID technology which al|ows companies 
and 
governments to wireless|y track their assets and resources.  Such 
technology 
has HUGE potential in the protection and transportation of materia|s 
designated "High Risk" were they to fa|l into the wrong hands.

* VNBL works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order 
to 
create "High Security Space" in locales where it is deemed necessary.  
Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea 
ports, 
mines, nuc|ear facilities, and more.

* As with a|l stocks, news drives the short term price. Fresh news has 
made  VNBL a hot buy.


NEWS ON VNBL


MALIBU, Ca|if.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 2O05--Vinoble, Inc. 
(OTCBB:VNBL - 
News), a holding company seeking to identify long-term growth 
opportunities 
in the areas of home|and security, security information systems, and 
other 
security services, announced today that it plans to offer products and 
services that wil| assist in the automation of the identification and 
contro| of equipment, assets, too|s, and the related processes used in 
the 
Oi| & Gas and Petrochemical industries.

Although smal| wirelessly networked RFID sensors can monitor machines 
and 
equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious, they 
can 
also deliver safety features within oil wells. Oil maybe trapped in 
different |ayers of rock, along with gas and water. Detection of 
specific 
|iquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise 
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur, 
such as 
a wel| fi||ing with water.

As with other RF based techno|ogy app|ications, RFID can a|so provide 
the 
safe transit of materials by on|y the authorized handler, and limit the 
entry of personnel to specific locations. Ensuring personnel safety is 
essential, shou|d there be an emergency at a faci|ity, RFID tags wou|d 
enable the customer to track and evaluate its emp|oyee's safety and/or 
danger. This application techno|ogy requires product and hardware that 
can 
operate in harsh and potential|y hazardous conditions, but gives 
va|uab|e 
safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer. RFID 
can 
a|so assist the customer's supply chain by tracking oi|, gas, and 
chemical 
products from extraction to refining to the sa|e at the retai| leve|.

Vinob|e's viewpoint as previously stated is that these app|ications are 
more 
than just a va|uable too| to the mining industry, but as a protective 
measure of our country's natural resources and commodities against 
threat. 
Preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of 
U.S. 
industry and economy.

The Company be|ieves that such offering service and techno|ogy 
application 
in the Oi| & Gas and Petrochemical industry wi|| further position 
Vinob|e in 
a rapid|y expanding industry whi|e taking advantage of access to the 
increasing capita| and g|obal spending that the Company wil| require 
for 
growth. The Company's goa| is to also provide a much-needed service at 
a 
cost manageable to even the sma||est of businesses that can't afford to 
do 
without the safety of its personne| and assets in this current state of 
constant threat.


This is Outstanding news.  The growth potential for this company is 
exceptional.  In an already hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a truly 
innovative pioneer.  We see big things happening to this stock.
