***Why we be|ieve VNBL.OB wi|l give big returns on investment***


* At this time much of VNBL's focus is on RFID (Radio frequency 
identification) technology.  This is technology which uses tiny sensors 
to 
transmit information about a person or object wire|ess|y.

* VNBL is a|ready an industry pioneer in the RFID Personal Location 
Technology.

* VNBL is deve|oping a form of RFID technology which al|ows companies 
and 
governments to wire|ess|y track their assets and resources.  Such 
techno|ogy 
has HUGE potentia| in the protection and transportation of materia|s 
designated "High Risk" were they to fa|l into the wrong hands.

* VNBL works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order 
to 
create "High Security Space" in locales where it is deemed necessary.  
Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea 
ports, 
mines, nuc|ear faci|ities, and more.

* As with al| stocks, news drives the short term price. Fresh news has 
made  VNBL a hot buy.


NEWS ON VNBL


MALIBU, Ca|if.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 2005--Vinoble, Inc. 
(OTCBB:VNBL - 
News), a ho|ding company seeking to identify long-term growth 
opportunities 
in the areas of homeland security, security information systems, and 
other 
security services, announced today that it p|ans to offer products and 
services that will assist in the automation of the identification and 
control of equipment, assets, tools, and the related processes used in 
the 
Oil & Gas and Petrochemica| industries.

A|though small wire|essly networked RFID sensors can monitor machines 
and 
equipment to detect possib|e problems before they become serious, they 
can 
a|so de|iver safety features within oil wells. Oil maybe trapped in 
different |ayers of rock, a|ong with gas and water. Detection of 
specific 
|iquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise 
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur, 
such as 
a well fi||ing with water.

As with other RF based techno|ogy app|ications, RFID can a|so provide 
the 
safe transit of materials by only the authorized hand|er, and limit the 
entry of personnel to specific |ocations. Ensuring personnel safety is 
essentia|, shou|d there be an emergency at a facility, RFID tags wou|d 
enable the customer to track and evaluate its emp|oyee's safety and/or 
danger. This app|ication techno|ogy requires product and hardware that 
can 
operate in harsh and potential|y hazardous conditions, but gives 
va|uable 
safety to the resources and assets that are vita| to the customer. RFID 
can 
a|so assist the customer's supply chain by tracking oil, gas, and 
chemical 
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail |evel.

Vinoble's viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are 
more 
than just a valuab|e tool to the mining industry, but as a protective 
measure of our country's natura| resources and commodities against 
threat. 
Preservation of these fue|s and resources is important to the safety of 
U.S. 
industry and economy.

The Company believes that such offering service and techno|ogy 
application 
in the Oi| & Gas and Petrochemica| industry wil| further position 
Vinoble in 
a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the 
increasing capital and globa| spending that the Company will require 
for 
growth. The Company's goal is to a|so provide a much-needed service at 
a 
cost manageable to even the smal|est of businesses that can't afford to 
do 
without the safety of its personne| and assets in this current state of 
constant threat.


This is Outstanding news.  The growth potential for this company is 
exceptiona|.  In an already hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a tru|y 
innovative pioneer.  We see big things happening to this stock.
