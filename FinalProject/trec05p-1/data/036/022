From:Seiji Ishikawa

Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Seiji Ishikawa a tax lawyer and auditor.I have been attached to the Hang Seng Bank Ltd to their 
auditing for the year end.I along with the director of operations have a concealed business suggestion for you.
Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General Ali Zubair who was with the Iraqi forces and also a business man made a numbered fixed deposit 
for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity 
several notice was sent to him,even during the war early this year. 

Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him.We later find out that the Major and his family had been 
killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home.

After further investigation it was also discovered that General Ali Zubair did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including 
the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my 
bank. So,Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it.
What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the 
Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner 
to stand as the next of kin to  General Ali Zubair so that you will be able to receive his funds.


WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare 
the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to General Ali Zubair, all that is required from you at this stage is for you 
to provide me with your Full Names and Address and your telephone numbers so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made 
the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your 
favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a 
legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents.Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters 
concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for 
you.Should you be interested please send me your Full names and address,your telephone and fax numbers and I will provide you with more details of 
this operation.l will prefers you to reach me via this email: seijiishikawa200@netscape.net

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards
MR SEIJI ISHIKAWA
