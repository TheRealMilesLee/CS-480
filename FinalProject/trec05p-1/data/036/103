how are you,

Im a younge female who saw your dating profile. I have this feeling of being not that greate, because everyone tries to take adventage of me one way or another .. thought came to my mind  
to have pics and videos of me online like other girl do.  It's neet how my private life is inside one website ;) The site has a verification thingy since I might get in trouble in my college if minors view it ..
Want to have cyber friend, who knows maybe more in the future ;D
