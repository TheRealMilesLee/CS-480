Hi Group,

Need input for Lari as our ride approaches (Pat can you forward to Lu and
ask him to reply to me).

I know some of you have ridden with Lari many times, but her scheduler is
facilitating this process and has asked for some information.  Please
provide the following and I will batch and send to Lari:


Years riding
How often currently riding
type of riding (i.e. English lessons, dressage, trail)
type of saddle preferred
age, height and weight


Also, we initially planned on an all-day ride on Sat, and a four-hour ride
on Sunday so we could all head back relatively early.  Lari would like to
know where we want to ride on each day.  Nora is only riding for the
four-hour ride, and prefers the beach.  How about an all-day ride in the
redwoods on Saturday, with a four-hour beach ride on Sunday?


Amy
