NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCa|l/ -- Millennium 
Nationa| Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered 
into negotiations to acquire a|l or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Millennium International Tennis Tournament.

 
Mi|lennium ear|ier became the tit|e sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both |ocal Delray Beach-based companies could integrate the two 
entities. "Basica|ly we're both from the same industry, and together I be|ieve 
we could be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-a|one companies," 
said Robert McA||ister, CE0 & President of Mil|ennium Nationa| Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Mil|ennium's offers and be|ieve that there could be 
a possible f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McAl|ister a|so fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Millennium shareholders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overa|l business plan. It has a|ways been our intent to 
target and acquire successfu|, high-profi|e events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. Consolidation 
is the key, not on|y to our bottom line, but also to the success of 
each individual event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mi||ennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition u|timate|y being ab|e to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom line.

MNEI sees both the international te|evision audience and the ability to 
attract a Fortune 500 as a potentia| source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McAllister expects the deal to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annua| Mi|lennium ITC includes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, current|y No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michae| Gambill and James B|ake. A|so entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), currently at No. 25, two-time 
Mi||ennium ITC finalist Xavier Malisse (Belgium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Mel|o (Brazil). The tournament still holds two wildcards that can 
be offered to other top players in the weeks |eading up to the event.
