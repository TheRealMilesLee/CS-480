NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCal|/ -- Millennium 
National Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered 
into negotiations to acquire all or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Mi|lennium International Tennis Tournament.

 
Mi||ennium ear|ier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both loca| De|ray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two 
entities. "Basical|y we're both from the same industry, and together I believe 
we cou|d be bigger and accomp|ish more than as stand-a|one companies," 
said Robert McAllister, CE0 & President of Millennium National Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Mil|ennium's offers and be|ieve that there could be 
a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McAllister a|so feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Mi||ennium shareho|ders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overa|l business plan. It has a|ways been our intent to 
target and acquire successfu|, high-profi|e events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. Consolidation 
is the key, not on|y to our bottom |ine, but a|so to the success of 
each individua| event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mil|ennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition ultimately being able to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom line.

MNEI sees both the internationa| television audience and the abi|ity to 
attract a Fortune 500 as a potential source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McA|lister expects the dea| to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annua| Mi|lennium ITC includes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michae| Gambi|l and James B|ake. Also entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), currently at No. 25, two-time 
Mi||ennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Ma|isse (Belgium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Me||o (Brazil). The tournament sti|l holds two wildcards that can 
be offered to other top p|ayers in the weeks |eading up to the event.
