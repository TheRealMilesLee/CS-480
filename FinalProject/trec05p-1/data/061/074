Ken:

I reviewed the letter from Mr. S. Huey Long that you forwarded to me regarding his suggestion that you discuss with Mr. Ravi N. Tikoo the Dabhol situation and more specifically the Lakshmi LNG carrier and in return agree to let him bid on future LNG carrier chartering or financing business.  As you probably recall, we are a minority investor in the Lakshmi, with Mitsui OSK Lines the majority investor and operator of the vessel.  We are not really in a position to control decision making with respect tot he vessel and are currently maneuvering to get Mitsui to buy out our position.  Accordingly, I do not think there is anything productive to be gained from Mr. Tikoo with respect to the Lakshmi.  As to whether he can help more generally with respect to India, I defer to your judgement.  I think we are already well connected and engaging any additional intermediaries carries more risk in terms of confusion, mixed messages or inappropriate behavior from a FCPA perspective.  If you would like I can have our LNG group respond with a polite letter informing him that we are not currently considering any additional LNG carriers, but that we would be happy to allow him to arrange a meeting at such time in the future as we have shipping needs.

Jim
