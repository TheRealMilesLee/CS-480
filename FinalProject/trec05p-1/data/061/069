the shores of Nigeria. Hence this message to you
seeking your assistance so as to enable me present
your private/company account details as a beneficiary
of contractual claims alongside that of the 
contractor, to enable me transfer the difference of
US$28,000,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million United States

the fund will be disbursed as stated below.

incidental expenses that may be incurred during the
course of the transaction.

3. 60% of the fund will be for me which I intend to
invest in your country with you as my partner.

out for a smooth actualization of the transaction
within the next few working days of commencement. For
further details as to the workability of this
transaction, please respond by return mail on my

response. Please when replying, indicate your
