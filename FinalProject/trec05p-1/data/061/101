Subject: Effects on Distributed Energy Are Unclear - CERA Alert 



Title: California Rescinds Customer Choice; Effect on Distributed Energy Is Unclear 	
URL(s):	

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2686;


***********************************************************************

EFFECTS ON DISTRIBUTED ENERGY ARE UNCLEAR

On September 20, 2001, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) voted 
to rescind electric retail choice, effective immediately. Although there are no 
pending decisions directly addressing distributed energy, many stakeholders 
fear that the door is now open to nonbypassable charges and exit fees that 
would render new self-generation projects uneconomic.

*   Amid higher rates, industrial customers examine self-generation options, 
but incentive program for projects under 1 megawatt is sending mixed signals. 

*   Southern California Edison's still-precarious financial situation is a 
threat to many existing small power producers in the state.

*   PG&E's bankruptcy recovery plan would provide 100 percent payment to 
generators.

*   Continued uncertainty is chilling the market for distributed energy.
