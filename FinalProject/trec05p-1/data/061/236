In Germany, Berlin's minister for culture Adrienne Goehler called the World Trade Center twin 110-story towers destroyed by the hijackers ``phallic symbols.'' The comment brought calls for her resignation, but also an explanation from Goehler. 
``In the context of my statement that the 'attacks were aimed symbolically at the heart of America,' I also made the comment that the towers are ``phallic symbols,''' she said. ``It was an answer to the question 'What sort of symbolic images did it remind me of?'''
