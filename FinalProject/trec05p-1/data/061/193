Product Type(s): US East Power Phy Firm Spread (LD)    (2166)	

Trader(s): Jeff King		
Description(s):	US Pwr PhyLD Spd 	ERCOT N2001 vs ERCOT               USD/MWh

A US Power Spread Transaction (as defined below) with Enron Power Marketing, Inc. under which the Seller (the "Spread Seller") and the Buyer (the "Spread Buyer") shall enter into two physical power transactions, under which either (A) for the case in which Counterparty submits an offer to buy from Enron, Counterparty shall buy the First Product and sell the Second Product, each in respect of the quantity of Firm (LD) energy equal to the Hourly Quantity at the Contract Price in accordance with the terms of the "Firm (LD)" definition in Schedule P of the Edison Electric Institute Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement Version 2.1 (modified 4/25/00), including, without limitation, any defined terms contained therein, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the master agreement, if any, that governs these Transactions ("Firm (LD) Energy"); or (B) for the case in which Counterparty submits an offer to sell to Enron, Counterparty shall sell the First Product and buy the Second Product, each in respect of the quantity of Firm (LD) energy equal to the Hourly Quantity at the Contract Price.
The transaction is for the applicable hours as set forth herein on each Delivery Day for the Effective Date 01 Oct 2001 to the Termination Date 31 Oct 2001.
The Contract Price for the Second Transaction in this short description will be the midpoint of the bid and offer price(s) on the Website for the second product listed in the short description at the time of the Transaction if both the bid and offer prices are then available or the available price if only one of such prices is then available. The Contract Price for the First Transaction will be the Contract Price used for the Second Transaction, modified by the price submitted by the Counterparty on the Website.
The Spread Transaction shall mean the ERCOT Transaction together with the ERCOT N 2001Transaction.  The Spread Seller and the Spread Buyer agree that the ERCOT Transaction and the ERCOT N 2001 Transaction shall be treated as separate transactions under any applicable agreement(s) governing such transactions.  Accordingly, for example, if a party fails to perform under the ERCOT Transaction, the other party is not excused from performance under the ERCOT N 2001 Transaction based on such non-performance.  However, unless otherwise expressly defined, the term "transaction" as used on the Website shall mean each of the ERCOT Transaction and the ERCOT N 2001 Transaction.  The ERCOT Transaction is for delivery or receipt of energy to any points within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. ("ERCOT") at Seller's daily election. If and when possible for Seller to designate under pertinent ERCOT scheduling practices, any such points shall be connected to the ERCOT Transmission Grid by Transmission Facilities (as such terms are defined in the ERCOT Protocols) operated at or above 138kV.  The ERCOT N 2001 transaction is for delivery or receipt of energy to any points within the North 2001 Zone as finalized pursuant to the action on April 17, 2001 by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. ("ERCOT") Board of Directors, at Seller's daily election. If such North 2001 Zone is superceded by a zone or zones of different boundaries, Seller shall nevertheless be required, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, to deliver the energy to points within the geographical area coextensive with the originally defined North 2001 Zone.  If and when possible for Seller to designate under pertinent ERCOT scheduling practices, any such points shall be connected to the ERCOT Transmission Grid by Transmission Facilities (as such terms are defined in the ERCOT Protocols) operated at or above 138kV.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatt-hours (MWh) and the quantity shown shall be in MW's delivered in each applicable hour for the duration of the Transaction (the "Hourly Quantity').
