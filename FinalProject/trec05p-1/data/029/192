Good Afternoon Liaison Representatives and Energy Committee Members,

The next meeting of the SVMG Energy Committee is scheduled for Wednesday,
August 22 at 3:00pm.  We will be hosted by Exodus, located at 2831 Mission
College Blvd. in Santa Clara, Training Room MC1.

We expect an informative and thought provoking presentation from Tal Finney,
Senior Policy Advisor to Governor Gray Davis.  We hope to gain a more
intimate understanding of energy policy activities in Sacramento as well to
influence future activity by relaying the needs and concerns of Bay Area
business.  This is a great opportunity.  We hope to see you there.

Please remember to confirm your attendance by replying to this e-mail or
calling 408-501-7870.  Thank you very much and have a pleasant week.

Regards,

Laura M. Goldseth
Associate, SVMG Energy Programs
