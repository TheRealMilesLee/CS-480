I know you guys have a few other things on your mind these days, but......
With Rod Eddington unavailable, might we not best fill that slot by inviting 
Brian Wilson. He is an energy minister, charged by Blair with chairing a 
review by the Cabinet Office's Performance and Innovation Unit of energy 
policy to meet "the challenge of global warming while ensuring secure, 
diverse and reliable energy supplies at a competitive price." My 
understanding is that Britain is worried about excessive reliance on gas from 
foreign sources, scared to death by the experience in California, and looking 
for some way to revive the nuclear option.
    If you think Wilson worth having, I will draft an invitation letter for 
Ken's consideration.
    Steve: Are you going to take Eddington up on his invitation to visit?
