Lagos Annex Office
E-MAIL:jubril@lmxmail.sk

Attention:Sir/Madam,

We write to solicit your assistance in an urgent
business transaction, which we are prosecuting under
condition of strict confidentiality. We got your
contact through the Nigeria. Chamber of Commerce and
Industries (NCC), subsequently we ran a check on your firm
through Merrill Lynch international and Salomon brothers
catalog. Your creditability to handle a transaction of
this magnitude, which requires confidentiality, was
confirmed accordingly.

We are top government officials and currently members of
the Federal Government of Nigeria Senate Committee on
Contract Review Panel (S.C.C.R.P).
In order to commence this business, we solicit your
assistance to enable us transfer into your account the sum
of US$62.5M (Sixty Two Million, Five Hundred
Thousand U.S. Dollars) only. The source of these fund is
as follows: During the last Military Regime here in
Nigeria the official of that Government set-up companies
and awarded themselves and their cohorts,contracts which
were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries. As part
of its inaugural policy, the present Civilian Government
set up a Senate Committee Contract Review Panel, a panel
in which we are members.

In the course of our investigation, we identified a
lot of over-inflated contract funds, which are
presently floating in the Apex Paying Bank ready for
payment to any contractors with formal genuine claim.
However, by virtue of our position as public servants and
members of this panel, we cannot acquire these funds in
our name. Therefore, we require the assistance of a
sincere foreign partner hence this email letter.
We are interested in the transfer of the said sum of
US$62.5M. We have agreed amongst ourselves to share
the total funds thus:-(1) 25% for our foreign partner
(you). (2) 65% for us (the officials) (3) 10% to be used
in setting taxation and all incidental (local and foreign)
expenses.

Thus, we have worked out the modalities of the
prosecution of this transaction, which meet all legal and
administrative requirements in our country, and those of
international arbitration. We hope to conclude this
transaction within seven (7) banking days and commence the
transfer of funds. To enable us commence the prosecution
of this transaction, we require from you the following
urgently by email:

(1) Re-confirm weather to use you company name or your name as the
    beneficiary.
(2) Your company address.
(3)Your bank name and address.
(4) Your account number and account name (if any).
(5) Your telephone and fax numbers or any other relevant
  information you may deem helpful.

With the above information, we shall use your company name
or your name to re-award the contract, put up letters of
claim and apply for payment. Note that your account in
question may need not have money in it.
The most important thing is the ability of the account to
receive the incoming funds.

We are looking forward to doing business with you. Please
acknowledge the receipt of this email weather in
acceptance or not to enable us to know the next step of
action.

Please, direct your response to my private email address:
jubril@lmxmail.sk

Regards.
