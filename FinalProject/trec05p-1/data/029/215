Rick,

Our group has completed our new investment strategy and are preparing to move into the execution phase.  I would appreciate the opportunity to present the strategy to you, Dave Gorte and Randy Petersen.  It would take about 1 hour, and I would value your feedback.  Let me know if you are up for it, and I will have my assistant schedule it.

Thanks,
KG
