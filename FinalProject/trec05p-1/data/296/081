Well, I volunteer to baby sit too.  And I don't live on the edge of the 
earth.  Although- I'm not up for the breast-feeding part....

Actually I am.  The little woman and the little bundle of joy both sleep in 
the other room.  Makes it easy for me.  My woman is trying to breastfeed.  I 
can't tell you how stressfull that has been.  There needs to be a class for 
guys on how to best support their "Woman" after birth.

Ahhh, my little bundle of joy is cute though.  And her mom lives in town and 
spends a lot of time over at out place which works out great.  We can go out 
for dinner pretty easy.  A lot of people don't seem to have that.  Judy said 
she would baby sit but it's not worth the trip to the edge of the earth in 
Katy.

Well, I don't know.  I tried emailing him but haven't gotten a response.
Guess he doesn't want to talk to me....

Are you getting any sleep these days with the new addition?

Is my buddy Robert Allwein working with you?  If so give him a big kiss and
a hug from me.
