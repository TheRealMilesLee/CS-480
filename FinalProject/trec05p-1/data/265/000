"I've decided that to raise my grades I must lower my standards.  -- Houghton Library, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts",
"Villains are picked off in order of ascending nastiness... sadistic brutes, followed by smarmy flacks, followed by twisted visionaries in expensive suits. Among the heroes, we don't have to worry about the principled male scientist, the dynamic female animal behaviorist, or the stowaway children.  But even among the good guys, a marginal physiognomy or a receding hairline can spell doom. Keep your eye on that sad-faced electronics specialist.  He's bald, and he's gonna pay.  -- Stephen Harrigan",
"Avez-vous la plume de ma tante?  Ne travaillez jamais!  (This is an actual piece of grafitti in Seattle....)  -- Megan Coughlin (translation: Do you have my Aunt's feather?  Never work!)",
"The power to tax involves the power to destroy.  -- John Marshal, McCulloch v. Maryland, 1819",
"I know my baby's loose, 'cause she shakes her caboose.  -- John Dobbin",
"I can't complain, but sometimes I still do.  -- Joe Walsh", "Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.  -- Casablanca",
"I know you said you don't eat anything with a face.  But a good butcher will cut that part off for you if you ask.",
"No doubt the much-ballyhooed Bob.  -- Frasier", "Writing tip:  Self-contradiction is confusing, and yet strangely enlightening.",
