C/C: UNITED NATIONS REFUGEE CAMP
PLATEAU ABIDJAN COTE D'IVOIRE.

ATTN: DEAR BELOVED IN THE LORD,
PERMIT ME HERE TO INTRODUCE MY SELF TO YOU.I AM RAYMOND KAMARA I'M A YOUNG 
BOY. THE ONLY SON AND CHILD OF (MALLAM BUKAR . MUSA. KAMARA ) A FULANI CATTLE 
HEADS MAN (A NOMADIC) AND A TRADITIONAL HUNTER FROM THE MENDE SIERRA-LEONE 
WHEN MY FATHER WAS ALIFE HE WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND A WIDELY KNOWN FARMER IN THIS 
PART OF THE REGION. HE WAS A RESPECTED FARMER WITH SPECIALITY IN CATTLE
FARMS AND VARIOUS OTHER AGRICULTURAL AND HUNTING PRODUCTS LIKE THE HIDES AND 
SKINS FROM KILLED ANIMALS.

UPON THIS ACHEIVEMENTS HE WAS HUMBLE AND DUE TO HIS HUMILITY NOBODY KNEW OF 
HIS WEALTH.MY LATE FATHER HAD MADE HIS WEALTH THROUGH HARD WORK THOUGH THROGH 
HIS CATTLES WHICH HE REARED FROM PLACE TO PLACE AS A CATTEL HEADS MAN FROM THE 
LIVE STOCK CAMPS NEARER OUR VILLAGE.

THE SALE OF THESE CATTLES FROM HIS FLOKS TO RICH CATTLE MERCHANTS WHOM TRADED 
ON CATTLES FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY THROUGH THE WEST AFRICAN SUB REGION BROUGHT
MY FATHER WEALTH,PROSPERITY WHICH WAS USED TO MEASURE HIS SOCIAL STANDARDS IN 
THE PASTURIST AFRICA. HOWEVER DUE TO THE BOOMING OF MY LATE FATHERS CATTLE
TRADE AND THE WEALTH HE MADE FROM IT THROUGH HARD WORK HE WAS ABLE TO MAKE 
ALOT OF MONEY AND ALSO THROUGH WHICH HE SENT ME TO SCHOOL, SINCE HE NEVER GOT 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO SCHOOL TO AQUIRE THE WHITEMANS WISDOM(EDUCATION)
BEFORE HE WAS KILLED BY HIS FELLOW NOMADIC CATTLE HEADS MAN DURING A CATTLE 
RAID BY TRIBAL ENEMIES DUE TO ENVY.

WHEN MY MOTHER DIED ON THE 21ST OCTOBER 2002. MY FATHER TOOK ME SO SPECIAL 
BECAUSE I WAS MOTHERLESS AND NEEDED MOTHERLY CARE. I HAD DONE EVERYTHING AT MY 
DISPOSAL TO SAVE MY FATHER'S LIFE SINCE HE WAS THE ONLY PARENT I HAD BUT 
UNFORTUNATELY FATE HAD ITS WAY .

FINALLY BEFORE THE DEATH OF MY FATHER ON 10TH OF FEBUARY 2003 IN OUR VILLAGE 
IN MENDE NORTHERN PART OF SIERRA-LEONE.HEMMY FATHER SECRETLY CALLED ME ON
BEDSIDE HIS HOSPITAL BED AND SAID I QUOTE "MY SON RAYMOND I HAVE THE SUM OF 
US$12.000.000 (TWELVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS)WHICH I DEPOSITED IN A
TRUST FIXED ESROW ACCOUNT WITH A BANK IN ABIDJAN REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE, MY 
LATE FATHER THEREFORE HANDED OVER ALL THE RELEVANT DOCUMENTS COVERING THIS
FUND DEPOSIT.

UPON MY ARRIVAL IN ABIDJAN WHERE I SUCCESSFULLY CONTACTED THE BANK TO INFORM 
THEM OF MY INTENTIONS TO TRANSFER THE FUND WHICH IS DEPOSITED BY MY LATE FATHER
TO A FORIEGN BENEFICARY THAT I WILL TRUST WORTYHY AND FATHERLY WHOM WILL HELP 
ME MANAGE THIS MONEY TO COMPLETE MY EDUCATION WHICH HAS BEEN MY WISH AND THE
WISH OF MY FATHER.

HE ALSO EXPLAINED TO ME THAT IT WAS BECAUSE OF THIS WEALTH THAT HE WAS 
POISONED BY HIS COLEAGUES AND THAT I SHOULD LEAVE TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER AS 
BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND THAT I SHOULD SEEK FOR A FOREIGN PARTNER IN A COUNTRY 
OF MY CHOICE WHERE I WILL TRANSFER THIS MONEY AND USE IT COMPLETELY FOR MY 
EDUCATION AND ALSO TO INVEST FOR MY FAMILY TO BE ABLE TO KEEP HIS NAME
SINCE HE WILL NOT BE AROUND TO SHOW ME THE WAY ANY MORE AND TO GUIDE ME.


DEAREST ONE,IN THIS RESPECT I AM HONOURABLY SEEKING YOUR ASSISTANCE IN THE 
FOLLOWING WAYS : TO PROVIDE A BANK ACCOUNT WHERE THIS MONEY WOULD BE 
TRANSFERED TO SERVE AS THE GUARDIAN OF THIS FUND SINCE I AM STILL UNDERAGED (A 
YOUNG BOY)AND TO MAKE ARRANGEMENT FOR ME TO COME OVER TO YOUR COUNTRY TO
FURTHER OUR EDUCATION AS OUR FATHER WISHES . MOREOVER, SIR, I WILL REWARD YOU 
GREATLY FOR YOUR HUMBLE SERVICES AS I AM WILLING TO OFFER YOU 10% OF THE TOTAL 
SUM AS COMPENSATION FOR YOUR EFFORT/INPUT AFTER THE SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER OF 
THIS FUND TO YOUR NOMINATED ACCOUNT OVERSEAS.
