Attached are 2 documents describing the reorganization of the west trading desk.  I have assigned new books to all of the traders except Phillip. We are currently moving the August physical trades into the new books and plan to be finished tomorrow. You will continue to use your existing financial books through July 31st.  All August physical deals done during bid week should flow into the new physical books and the old financial books.   Your financial trades will move on the night of July 1st after we calc.  Starting August 1st, you will have your positions in your new financial and physical books.  Russ is working on adding the new books to the West Intramonth Position Portfolio in Sitara.  You should be able to see your physical positions for August in the new books as soon as we get all of the deals moved (tomorrow evening at the latest).  The positions will be close in the morning, we just need to verify that we have not missed any deals and move all of the intra-desk deals.  Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks 

Anne
