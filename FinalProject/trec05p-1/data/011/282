We're OK with CPS (Constellation) also.  If you agree to the list I'll go ahead and submit them.

Those changes look fine to me, except we like to use CPS for Constellation.  Would that be OK for you?

I can agree to NRG, but everyone here uses AETS for Allegheny.
We have compiled several we would like to change and would like to submit them , also.
Let me know what you think.
See attached.
