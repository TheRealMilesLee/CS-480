Chris, 
Sorry I missed your call. 

Enron's need for protection of classified information furnished verbally is accepted. However, such information needs to be identified. Changed CA accordingly.

Hank, 

Made a couple of minor changes to the CA that incorporated yours. 
Please review and we will get you execution copies.
