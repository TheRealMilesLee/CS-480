If the cap fits, wear it. 



Fore-warned is fore-armed. . He bears misery best that hides it most. . Bad news travels fast. . Love sees no faults. .
Needs must when the devil drives. 

Let sleeping dogs lie.

.Do as you would be done by. . Make hay while the sun shines. . He who drinks a little too much drinks much too much. .
Memory is the treasure of the mind. . Cheerfulness smooths the road of life. . The course of love never did run smooth. .

A bird makes his nest little by little. . Find a coin pick it up. There is no better looking-glass than an old friend. .
