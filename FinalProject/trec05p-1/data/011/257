DEAR PARTNER,

My name is JANG DOO-HWAN, The brother of Mr. CHUN
DOO-HWAN, the former President of South Korea who 
seized power in a military coup in 1979 and who ruled 
from 1979 to 1987. My brother was pushed out of office 
and charged with treason ,corruption and embezzlement 
of over 21billion won. He was wrongly sentenced to death but 
fortunately AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL stepped in and commuted 
the sentence to life. We thank God that he has finally being 
released though still under house arrest in the sense of 
conditions of the freedom.

During my brother's regime as president of South
Korea, we realized some reasonable amount of money
from various deals that we successfully executed. I
have plans to invest this money for my children&#8217;s
future on real estate and industrial production.

Before my brother's was overthrown, I secretly
siphoned the sum of $30,000,000 million USD (Thirty
million United states dollars) out of Seoul and
deposited the money with a security firm that
transports valuable goods and consignments through
diplomatic means.

I am contacting you because I want you to deal with
the security company and claim the money on my behalf
since I have declared that the consignment belong to
my foreign business partner. You shall also be
required to assist me in investment in your country. I
hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will not
sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me
properly, I expect you to declare what percentage of
the total money you will take for your assistance.
When I receive your positive response I will let you
know where the security company is and the payment pin
code to claim the money which is very important. What
we need is to indicate your interest that you will
assist us by receiving the money on our behalf in
Europe. For this, you shall be considered to be the
beneficiary of the money. The project in brief, is
that the funds with which we intend to carry out our
proposed investments in your country, is presently in
the custody of a Diplomatic Courier Services Company
in Europe.

We cannot do this ourselves because we do not have any
relatives living outside South Korea and moreover we
do not want the government of my Country to know about
the money because they will believe I got the money from
my brother while he was still in office as president
.Once you confirm the receipt of the money ,I will
come over with my Children to your Country or any
Country in Europe to start a new life with my Family.

As soon as payment is effected, and the amount
mentioned above is successfully transferred into your
account, we intend to use our own share in acquiring
some estates abroad. For this too you shall also be
our overseas manager of all our properties and
you will be paid based on a certain percentage agreed
on by both parties.

For now, let all our communication be by e-mail
because my line is right now connected to the South
Korean Telecommunication Network services therefore we
can not take the chances of being heard.
Please also send me your telephone and fax number. I
will ask my son to contact you to give you more
details on after I have received a response from you. 
I am going to introduce you to him as an age long friend 
so as to prevent him from using any of his own friends 
who I regard as sycophants who are around him for financial 
gains and treacherous if he gives them this opportunity. This 
I got from the experience I had when the people turned 
against Chun, my brother that became the prelude of our sorrow. 

The reason why it took this long was that the security
company&#8217;s agreement with me was that my brother must
personally sign the Power of Attorney that will
transfer title to the prospective beneficiary. It was
a long wait but it paid off. His excellency, Chun
Doo-Hwan does not want to be personally involved for
security reason.

Your quick response will be highly appreciated. Thank
you in anticipation of your cooperation.

Yours faithfully,
JANG DOO-HWAN
