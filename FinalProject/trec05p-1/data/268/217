Did you ejàculate before or within a few minutes of penetràtion? 

   Then you must order Extrà-Time Now!... 
Here's Why: Extrà-Time is the only male sexuàl 
performance formula that, not only stops premàture 
ejàculation, but actually "cures" it. Extrà-Time is the 
only product that allows "YOU" to control when you ejaculate.

   Since 1997, Extra-Time has been ranked #1 for 
a very good reason ... "It Works"! If you normally ejàculate 
within a few minutes of penetràtion, then you must order 
Extra-Time. You'll last 5 to 10 minutes longer, the very first night..... 
  GUARANTEED!
