FROM:MR.JOHN TOMA VAYE.
SECTOR 11 OUAGADOUGOU
BURKINA FASO

Dear Friend,

Kindly accept my apology for sending my mail to you. I am a true God fe=
aring person, and I want you to trust me and help me out in this my con=
dition. I believe you are a highly respected personality, considering t=
he fact that I sourced your profile from a human resource profile datab=
ase on your country in the Internet.

Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and f=
ragile political situation in Liberia but it has formed consistent head=
lines in the CNN, BBC news bulletins.My Name is MR.JOHN TOMA VAYE from =
Liberia, a Country in West  Africa. My late Father is Issac Toma Vaye, =
Deputy Minister of Public Works in Liberia. My father  was falsely accu=
sed of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA CHARLES TAYLOR)=
 from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him. You can verify =
this from some of the international newspapers posted in the web sites =
below:

(I)http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-07-15-liberia_x.htm

Before my father  was killed, he moved out the sum of $7.5 million  thr=
ough a diplomatic means, and deposited it with a Security Company  in B=
urkina FASO. And this money was meant for importation of agricultural m=
achinery. The documents used in these depositions, together with the ke=
y of the safe, are with me.

In my father's will, he instructed that this money must be invested ove=
rseas with the help of a foreigner who is reliable and trustworthy. Wit=
h his death, I came to BURKINA FASO as a refugee because the government=
 is threaten  our life . And I assure you that this transaction is a ri=
sk free.I need you to come to Burkina Faso to stand as my late father f=
oreign partner me and you will go to the security company and  collect =
the consignment that contain themoney.

 I have been to the security company several time to collect the consig=
nment after verification of all the documents regarding the deposit of =
the consignment the director of the security company told me that I hav=
e to come with the foreign partner of my late father before they can re=
lease the consignment because of the  instruction my late father given =
that without the security company saw his foreign partner the iron truc=
k box should not be released to his son alone.

All the documents regarding the deposit of the consignment is with me I=
t is because of this reason I needed your assistance to come and stand =
as the foreign partner of my late father for the security company to re=
lease the consignment to me and you.

I decided to give you 30% of the total amount and the balance will be i=
nvested in your country under your kind control and GOD guidance, on an=
nual profit sharing bases.Ofcause I will travel with you to your countr=
y as soon as the money is transfer from Burkina Faso to your country.=20=


Waiting to hear from you soon,

Best Regards,
Mr John Toma Vaye.
