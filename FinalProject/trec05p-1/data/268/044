During the past few weeks, we have received numerous requests for information about XMS, both from employees who are unfamiliar with XMS, and from current users who want to better understand how XMS has changed since filing for bankruptcy.  In response, we developed XMS Update Training.  This brown bag session will cover the following agenda items:

Approver level
Expensing Cash Advance  
Expense reports; current employees vs. terminated employees
How to select a "Profile"
How to set up multiple approvers  
How to submit expenses for contractors
Reviewing status
Receipt Report "Barcode" 
What is "Resubmit"
Who do I call for help?
