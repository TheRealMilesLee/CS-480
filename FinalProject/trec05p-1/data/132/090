Please see the attached assignment.  Kim, can someone on your staff/Peggy's staff please identify/confirm these ECC deals? I do not see a problem assigining the ENA deals to ECC as they are current month deals that will allow netting of the purchases and sales.  Should not affect the PMTM which has a threshold in the contract.  Would like to try to finish up quickly. Please advise if anything CRM can do to help.
 
Thanks,
Tanya
