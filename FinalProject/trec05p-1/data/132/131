Gary could you provide me with a list of the 7, 16, and 31 day NNG charts for the month of Oct. that were received late for measurement close.  Gas Logistics, Marketing and Operations is trying to get a feel for the number(s) of late charts that GMS is receiving.  If you have any question please give me a call.
