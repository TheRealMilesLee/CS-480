Dear Enron Users:

Due to a severe storm which hit central Texas last evening
CYNET is experiencing a temporary service interruption
of the assigned telephone numbers of it's Inbound Fax-2-Email
Service.

Our local loop carrier has advised us they are aware of the situation 
and they are working to restore this connectivity. 

While CYNET maintains back-up facilities for its Fax-2-Email services
the problem we are faced with is that we can not place the same user
telephone number within two different facilities at the same time. Our
technical team is working on future recommendations in the form of
having individual back-up numbers in the event of this type of outage.

We sincerely do apologize for any inconvenience this may
cause you and your users and expect to have this service restored
as soon as possible. 

Sincerely,

Robert P. Demyanovich
President & COO
