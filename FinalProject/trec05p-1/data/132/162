Dear eric,




ROCKETS TO DO BATTLE WITH THE MAVS SATURDAY

After trailing the Lakers by 15 points in the third quarter of last night's game, the Rockets needed a lift. They turned to the sold-out Compaq Center crowd and got what they were looking for. 

With the house-a-rockin', Steve, Cuttino and the gang led a furious second-half Rockets rally spurred by the energy of the sold-out arena. Although the comeback fell just short, the fans' support was a certain factor in the rally.

The Rockets will be looking for the same support Saturday when Michael Finley, Dirk Nowitzki and the Dallas Mavericks pay a visit to Compaq Center for a Texas Showdown. Game time is 7:30 p.m.

Tickets are going fast, so get yours today by calling 1-800-4NBA-TIX, visiting any Ticketmaster outlets or the Compaq Center box office, or ordering online at rockets.com (http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=133970&UID=45456540&MID=188026).

See you at Compaq Center!
