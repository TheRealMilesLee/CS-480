Hello Mr. Whalley,

I would like to introduce myself and my solutions in an extremely difficult
time in our nations history.  The tragedies of September 11th have caused
many corporations to re-evaluate their employees business travel.  The
challenge is that your business needs to continue to operate successfully;
and the need to communicate to your team is even greater.  Yahoo! is facing
these same issues.  With the new challenges of corporate travel, Yahoo!
Broadcast Services can offer you a consistent, cost effective, high impact,
engaging alternative to outside meetings.

Using the strength of the internet, Yahoo! Broadcast Services can allow
employees to participate in a corporate event anywhere, anytime.  Yahoo!'s
global network ensures consistent, reliable worldwide distribution of your
internal communication or message.  Yahoo! can also reach an external
audience without staging multiple events in multiple locations.  With our
help, Enron can increase internal/external access to Enron executives
without overextending their time.

Additionally, here is a link to some general information regarding
webcasting and some case studies that I believe you will find interesting.

General Information: http://business.broadcast.com

Internal Communications
"Webcasting…increased our speed to market, produced cost efficiencies, and
vastly reduced travel expenses."
Jim Kelly, Global Risk Management, PricewaterhouseCoopers
http://business.broadcast.com/case_studies/pwc.asp

Training
"Our users are very busy people. On-demand webcasts enable them to get the
information they need, when they need it."
Laura Heath Seelig, Training Program Manager, Texas Instruments
http://business.broadcast.com/case_studies/ti.asp


External Communications (Marketing)
"Satisfaction ratings from the online events now exceed our traditional
customer seminars. Last quarter, four of the top five programs were online
events. Plus, many topics we archive attract up to 10,000 additional
participants in over a few months."
Nancy Neipp, Director, Event Marketing and Seminars, Cisco Systems
http://business.broadcast.com/case_studies/cisco.asp

I would like to set up a time when Jim Lewandowski and myself can discuss
the Yahoo! alternatives with you.  I will call your assistant later this
week to set up a meeting.

Thanks,


Les Johnson

as routine to communicate with its employees via streaming over the
corporate intranet."
