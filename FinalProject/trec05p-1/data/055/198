Dear Friend,
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because,I 
believe everyone will die someday.

My name is Umaru Aliyu, a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been 
diagnosed with Esophageal cancer caring for my health.It has defiled 
all forms of medicine, and right now I have only about a few months to 
live, according to medical experts.I have not particularly lived my 
life so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my 
business.

Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to 
people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared 
for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life 
than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe 
when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.Now that God 
has called me, I have willed and given most of my properties and assets 
to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations,as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I did on earth.

So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the 
U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so 
badly, I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked members of my 
family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I 
have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan,they refused 
and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seems not to be contended with what I have left for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of 
twenty four million dollars $24,000,000,that I have with a 
Bank/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this 
deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.Please indicate your 
intention to help through this email Address
(aliyuumaru@mail2world.com)immediately.

And always remember that I have set aside 20% for you for your time 
and patience.I await your urgent response to this request.Thanks may 
God bless you and your family (AMEN).

Thanks
Regards
Mr Umaru Aliyu
