Kevin and Eric,
Please read Scott's question below.  I have no problem with being a little more open with the regulators.  I would not publish anything in the paper (as yet) showing a route, etc., etc. as that will only get the landowners stirred up before we are ready.  What are your thoughts?  Are you comfortable with Scott being able to show the regulators a map of a preliminary route?  John

In discussions with several agency personnel, it "appears" as though they
are somewhat aware of Sun Devil.  Is it still to be treated as confidential,
or can we discuss it more freely?  The main benefit I see, if we can discuss
it more freely, is that many of the regulators have said things like "I
would need to see a route to be able to answer your question better."  Let
me know.  Thanks,  Scott
