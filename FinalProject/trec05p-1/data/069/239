LLRX: The New legal Browser That Could

     "If you provide or support a dynamic legal practice, or if you want to be able to rely on somebody else to find, organize and maintain extensive Internet links, TheLaw.net is worth a look. Also, if your practice requires that you have access to updated appellate-level caselaw databases in several jurisdictions, TheLaw.net provides additional valuable content through a uniform interface....For any group of users who regularly access the Internet for legal research, I think that TheLaw.net is worth considering. TheLaw.net provides a new and innovative twist to using the Internet for legal research, by providing what aims to be a standalone and all-inclusive legal research software program....If TheLaw.net sounds like it could assist your practice or research, take it for a test drive. You might be surprised." (c) Roger V. Skalbeck, on review for LLRX, Technology Service Librarian & Webmaster, George Mason University School of Law; Web Committee Member, Law Librarians Soci!
