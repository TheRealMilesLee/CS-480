Dear Ms. Roffmann:

I am with Enron Power Marketing Inc. and have been working on our effort to test as an LSE in flight 1001.  I have a couple of questions regarding transmission services and hope that you can answer them or direct me to the person who can.

We need to speak with someone who can assist us in getting a service agreement set up for the Reliant control area in order for us to operate as a Load Serving Entity.  If someone can explain or provide information regarding the basic service package or other available packages that would be extremely helpful. 

Any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,

Smith L. Day
