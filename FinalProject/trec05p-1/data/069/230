Chris,

I've reviewed the DLK description you sent me and have revised it to clear up confusion over the meaning of EXW in the Delivery Terms section.  The elaboration of the Incoterm EXW showed that we really mean to use the FCA delivery term, due to Seller's retaining load out responsibility.  

The other substantive change made was to remove the reference to Delivery Location as being anywhere other than Seller's facilities in Chicago or Atlanta.  Because Buyer has full responsibility for carriage of the Commodity under either EXW or FCA, Seller should not care anything about the "Delivery Location"; Seller is assuming no obligation to delivery anywhere other than to a truck or rail car that Buyer has caused to be brought onto Seller's premises.  

There is a clean and marked copy of the DLK description for your review.  Please call with any questions.

Steve Van Hooser
