With an MBA can come added responsiblity. And for better or worse, 
with added responsibility can come the need to look your best.
Which is what brings me to you today.

Kenny Keswani has been serving as custom tailor to MBAs for over 20 years.
His business model -- landing young promising MBAs with his inexpensive
prices, and keeping them with his quality. A happy customer is a retained
customer, and that's what Kenny's banking on.  Having been a paying
customer before becoming his campus rep, I can attest for the quality.
I plan on staying a customer long after my days as rep are over.

Here's how it works.  Kenny will be in residence in the Oakland Airport
Hilton this Friday, and the Hotel Durant Saturday through Monday.  
(He will also be in SF Tuesday -Wednesday, and San Jose Thursday-Friday.)
He guides those interested in a fitting through the fabric selection process, 
then, once you're settled, measures you every which way.  
The result is a custom-made suit (or shirt, or tuxedo) delivered
to your doorstep in 6 to 8 weeks.

Prices are very reasonable given the quality.
Shirts range from $58-$75
Suits from $495-$695
and 
Tuxedos from $595-$795

Prices are comparable to off-the-rack, but obviously the fit is custom-made.
I apologize for the short notice, but hope that some students will be interested
in making an appointment.

Best,

Jon
