Rick after the joint Midwest-Atlantic Meeting on Wednes, I will have a better idea on possible candidates for dereg activity next year.  At this point, Missouri, Indiana and Louisiana are in the running.  Even W.V. has a shot at revitalization with less than a full corp press effort - if we care, of course.  Thus, I have kept the budgets for the 3 states at midlevel and will adjust to significantly decrease or increase modestly, based on what is decided, which is after your deadline.  If you would like me to revise this proposed budget to reflect those discussions, I will be happy to do so later this week.  Let me know.
