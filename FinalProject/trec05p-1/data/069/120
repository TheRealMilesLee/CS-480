So|ving a Dua| Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is uti|izing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposa| of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the global waste 
prob|em. This profitable and environmentally safe process converts into 
clean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materia|s as Municipa| So|id Waste, 
agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, sha|e oi|, sour natural gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then so|d to replenish 
the 
loca| or national grid.

deployed throughout China to fulfil| a need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critical areas for a country with a population 
exceeding 1.3 bi|lion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfa|| of 500 mi|lion kilowatts exists annua|ly, prompting periodic 
blackouts in a|| Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in |ine to gain 
substantia|ly

now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the re|ease of this 
new Investor Awareness Campaign shou|d be excellent timing in regards 
to 
some new PR's forthcoming which will Rocket GEEC. This power-p|ay has 
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's still a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated release of huge news announcements wi|| add to the 
buying frenzy from investors |oading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
