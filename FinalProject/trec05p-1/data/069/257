PacifiCorp is probably responsible for the onslaught of these Email's.  Most of PacifiCorp's Merchant tags that moved energy from CA to CA at a generator bus already used the term "NOR".  In our attempts to improve the checkout process so we could see our Merchant's schedules by tag I requested a software change to allow us to start scheduling his tags that contained the ARef value of "NOR" (No Oasis Required).  We then asked him to continue to use it and requested that he inform all those he did business with to also use it on our line so we could schedule against it.  I was not thinking about nor remembered Business Practice #11 at the time we implemented this and didn't realize it would be an issue.  Since the notification, I did some research and found that no standard is being used for the use of "Single Bus".  18 were "single buss", 8 were "single bus", 6 were "singlebus".  I have made the attached programming change to comply with Business Practice rule and I believe that Mark is going to send a notice to everybody that the rule needs to be followed as written.    I apologize for the inconvenience, it was not intentional.   We will accept all tags that properly use "Single Bus".   Responses are graciously accepted.

Your last paragraph is right on man.  It just the commie business practice 
that bites. 

Again, my view of the world is that the transmission should be associated 
with the sink control area - they are the one who takes it home.  The source 
control area shouldn't have the fake transmission. 

Guess part of the problem is due to CAs not registering as TPs which would 
make things much more consistent. 

PSEI will take NOR, SINGLEBUS, GF (if we're not looking), MIDC-MIDC, and 
other creative entries for the OASIS number for MIDC-MIDC transactions.
