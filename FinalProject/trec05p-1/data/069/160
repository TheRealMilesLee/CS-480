GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere

wastes, 
sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of used

nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's still a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated release of huge news announcements wi|| add to the 
buying frenzy from investors |oading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
