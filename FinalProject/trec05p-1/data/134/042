Hi to our new wholesale power team!
 
As you may know, Thane and Mike recently resigned from Enron (Thane is going to APX and Mike is going to AEP).  We will be determining how to cover their various areas, as well as the priorities we now have (as discussed by Rick on the Friday call).  Charles has agreed to be our ERCOT person.
 
I will be off the week of Thanksgiving, so please feel free to call me at home if you need anything (713-666-0304).  Have a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday!  Christi
