role in building a reliable and safe e-world. KSIGN

Latest News:

KSignPassOne is a type of Single Sign On (SSO) solution
which safely and efficiently manages numerous user names
and passwords for each end-user by applying appropriate
security functions and digital certificates. The solution
then automatically processes login by detecting login page
when accessing a certain website or client/server
environment on the Internet.

Enterprises and public institutions will be able to
provide their employees with easy access to complex
networks and websites on the Internet that previously
required unique user names and password authentication
at different locations. With KSignPassOne's central
management of user names and passwords, the user will
be able to automatically login, resulting in dramatic
savings in effort and time. KSign is planning to supply
the product to Japanese market through an exclusive
distributor.
