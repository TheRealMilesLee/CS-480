The Wall Street Alert - Special Investment Report - LQDX
   Smart investors understand that companies with 
government and military applications are especially 
attractive in times of global instability.
   Our current recommendation, LIQUIDIX, INC. of Arizona 
(OTC BB: LQDX), has positioned itself as the leading 
competitor in the high-tech industrial manufacturing 
industry with its customizable array of magnetic fluid 
vacuum seals.
   NASA, Honeywell, ADM, Intel, have already used the 
vacuum seals created by Liquidix. These products benefit 
such important technologies as navigational gyros, 
infrared detectors, heat-seeking missiles, laser sighting 
and night-vision equipment.
   Liquidix has signed contracts with several 
Military/Government Agencies and U.S. National 
Laboratories, including NASA, which have produced 
significant growth in the company.
   Liquidix is one of only three companies in the world to 
produce magnetic fluid vacuum seals and it's the only one 
that is traded publicly in the United States. Because 
costs in this industry are very similar between companies, 
Liquidix has studied and surpassed its competition in 
delivery time. Liquidix can deliver the same product to 
its destination in 1/4 the time of its nearest competitor, 
making them especially desirable for companies who must 
meet an increasing demand for magnetic fluid vacuum seals.   
Liquidix has conservatively estimated that their gross 
revenues for 2002 will increase more than 40% over 2001, 
and by 2003 will increase another 110%. Through strategic 
mergers and acquisitions Liquidix also estimates that 
their profit margins for 2002 will increase by 60% over 
2001, and by 2003 will increase another 200%.

REASONS TO OWN THE STOCK
  1. Liquidix provides magnetic fluid vacuum seals for 
government and military applications that are in higher 
demand due to increasing military activity in the U.S.
  2. Liquidix, through strategic alliances and 
acquisitions, has established itself as the leader of an 
industry that is projected to earn more than $4.5 billion 
dollars by 2002.
  3. Liquidix provides products to industry giants such as 
NASA, HONEYWELL, INTEL, and ADM, virtually guaranteeing 
the growth of this strong company.
  4. Liquidix aggressive and strategic acquisition of 
companies like Advanced Fluid Systems demonstrates a 
strong vision for the future and positions them as a world 
leader in magnetic fluid technology.
  5. Liquidix is one of only three companies in the world 
to produce magnetic fluid vacuum seals and it is the only 
one that is traded publicly in the U.S.
  6. Facilities owned and operated by Liquidix in the 
United States and Europe have given the company a foothold 
on both sides of the Atlantic, with opportunities to break 
into additional international markets.
