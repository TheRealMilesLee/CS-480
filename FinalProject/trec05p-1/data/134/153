Hey! Sorry I missed your call. I was at the mall with the girls. (I really
don't like to shop)  Bobby mentioned that Beverly's house will be available
over Thanksgiving. It'll be good to have the extra elbow room. Odds are that
Bobby and I may still stay at the bed and breakfast, just because I like it
so much. I feel so spoiled when I stay there.

It looks like we are just barely going to be able to be in Palacios. Bobby
is working Wednesday, so I think we are going to come in on Thursday. I
grimace at the thought of spending twice as much time just getting out of
Austin. I think we'll get up and leave early on Thursday and try to get
there by late morning. Then of course we need to come back on Friday to
Bobby get ready to "hop the pond".

What do we need to bring as far as plates, plastic silver ware and all that
good stuff??? Of course we'll bring cokes and beer and stuff like that, but
what else is needed?

We'll also bring some smoked turkey and dressing for Thursday too. We can
have a smorgasbord for our meal. And since we have access to Beverly's
house, I can warm stuff up over there, so as not to get in anyone's way.

I'm looking forward to seeing yall again. We are sorry we can't be there
longer, but we're glad to get to be there some.

Let me know what else I need to bring....

Hope you've had a good weekend!

Love,
Lisa
