here's one you must check out if there is even the slightest 
possibility you might be traveling November 26 through 
March 14, 2001! We're talking great deals to most US Airways
destinations when you purchase your ticket by midnight 
tonight, Monday November 19, 2001. More details:

Here are 3 sample fares from Rochester, NY:

Visit friends and family for the holidays!  Wrap up end of year 
business or plan your first trip for the New Year.  Whatever 
your plans, I hope you have an opportunity to take advantage of 
these great fares.
 
Have a safe and happy holiday!
