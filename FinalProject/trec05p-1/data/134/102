Dan,

This is a follow up to our telephone conversation of this
afternoon. The attachment, which apparently originated with you, is what
we will talk about during our conference call at 8:00 a.m. (California
time) on Monday. Thanks.

> The attached supplemental advice filing by SoCalGas replaces the
> changes to Rule 30, Transportation of Customer-Owned Gas, proposed by
> AL2837.   The purpose of this filing is to  describe the new internal
> receipt point operating procedures that SoCalGas is  implementing, and
> to request Commission authorization to include the revised  operating
> procedures in Rule 30. SoCalGas says this step is being taken in
> anticipation that it will be replaced with a system of firm tradable
> intrastate  transmission rights in Gas Industry Restructuring (GIR)
> proceeding, I.99-07-003.
> During  the GIR panel hearings, several parties requested that
> SoCalGas publish its  windowing criteria in tariffs to facilitate a
> better understanding of the method  used to allocate receipt point
> capacity.  SoCalGas agreed to make  such a filing, and D.99-07-015
> directed SoCalGas to file an advice letter adding  windowing
> information to its tariffs.  To comply with this directive, on August
> 6, 1999, SoCalGas filed AL2837, which has not been acted on by the
> Commission.
> Customer complaints about SoCalGas' windowing  procedures have
> convinced SoCalGas that it should replace its internal  windowing
> operating procedures with a system that is open to the maximum
> operating capacity at each SoCalGas receipt point.  SoCalGas is making
> these internal  operating changes effective November 1, 2001.
> SoCalGas held meetings with upstream  pipelines on October 17, and
> with interested customers and stakeholders on  October 18, regarding
> the upcoming changes.  They were invited to ask any questions in  the
> days leading up to the meetings.
> Comments and/or protests are due on November 21.  Have a good
> weekend!
