Pam,
As you know, we negotiated a deal for EOGR to take over our recently vacated space at 3AC 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21. We also negotiated a deal for them to purchase only the Teknion workstations which were already in the spaces on Levels 17-20 (not 21 furniture). The total purchase price is $205,000. plus all taxes.

I've been informed that the former EI groups report up to ETS. Therefore, the Bill of Sale shall be signed by an officer in ETS (Rod Hayslett), not EPSC. The Bill of Sale has been prepared by our legal team and is ready for Rod Hayslett to sign. I would like to get the document to you for signature and over to EOGR for signature by Friday, 11/9/01.

Let me know if you need anything further.

Thanks,
Reggie
