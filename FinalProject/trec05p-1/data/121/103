Hey Dad.  I know you're tied up in meetings, and I know you are probably very bored and anxious.  But I just wanted to let you know that at times like this I realize how AWESOME you are.  I'm sure you have tons of stuff on your mind, as today has definitely not been one of the better ones for our family.  But that which does not kill us makes us stronger, and God knows we will be stronger after this.  This will all be over soon and we will be able to look back and laugh (as I will also by then have figured out how to get my computer to stop running in safe mode and actually be able to read the e-mails I am typing.)  A pretty smart guy once told me that when things like this happen, they always seem huge at the time.  But in the timeline of your life [        timeline        ] this whole experience will encompass like one/one thousandth of the period at the end of this sentence.  I miss you and wish I could be there for this whole ordeal.  But please try to keep your chin up !
and your good spirit, because I'm 
pretty sure that's all that matters in the end.  I love you loads and wish you the best of everything.

Cheers big ears,
Jules

P.S.  I'm gonna send you a joke after I send this one.  Don't read it if it's not an opportune time for you to laugh out loud.
