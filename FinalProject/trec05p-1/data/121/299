CRY FOR HELP!!!
 Dear sir/madam,

This mail will definitely be coming to you as a surprise, but i must
crave
your indulgence to introduce myself to you.

I am Miss Marah sadija, former mistress to the son (Qusay) of the Iraqi
former leader, Saddam Hussein. I am an Ethiopian, by birth and i am
presently in a refugee camp in  Zimbabwe, where the living conditions
are
unbearable. I do not wish to take your time with a lenghty mail, but i
have
to  put this proposal to  you so that you can assist me. While i was
still
in contact with Qusay,he made a deposit in my name to  a security firm
in
Spain, which has an affiliate branch in  Amsterdam.

This deposit was made in my name and the secret code and necessary
documents are presently in the possession of an attorney, presently in
London.  This deposit was made in the form of a consigment and the
content
is a  considerable amount of money in United state dollars which i
cannot
disclose to you for security purposes, until you have confirmed your
willingness to assist me. I would be pleased and grateful to you if you
could  assist me in  collecting this consignment on my behalf from the
security firm in Spain, upon  which i will be offering you a percentage
for
your efforts. The attorney in London, will arrange an authority to
release
and pay  in your name which you will tender to the security firm
coupled
with all  necessary documents that will back up your claims in
collecting
this consignment  on my behalf.

I have to stop here now as your response will determine our subsequent
corresspondence. Please feel free to dis-regard this  proposal if it is
 not
in line with your principles.

For security reasons please reply to : marahsadija@netscape.net

Allah bless you,

Marah Sadija.
