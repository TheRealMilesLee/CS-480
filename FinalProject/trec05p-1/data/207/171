"Oktoberfest really means \"secret German plan for dominating international trade and consumption in beer and large pretzels\"; it's always wise to investigate these things.  -- Holly Vineyard",
"I kind of like the idea of a universal Hansard. Every nuance, every bit, right or wrong, spoken in passion or from reason, drunk or sober, trapped. Caught. Frozen. Pickled. Searchable.  Archivable. Part of the historical record. Your corrections can come later.  And they'll get trapped and pickled too. But I think having the original verbatim of everything is a neat and useful thing. Damned dangerous too, I admit, but hey, so's driving at 85mph, right?  -- Ron Resnick",
