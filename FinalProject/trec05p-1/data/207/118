Oncor TDSP will be re-sending, this week, the 814_04 transactions (count of
4,471)  identified as outstanding on the current ERCOT Siebel database. As
these transactions date back to December 17th, we were of the understanding
that ERCOT would be re-dropping the transactions in the date range of
December 17th through January 17th, as we understood that these
transactions were involved in the ERCOT "paperfree" issue. We apologize for
our misunderstanding.
