The Oi| and Gas Advisory

Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bull market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oil Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi|lions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

VANCOUVER, April 22- Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to explore the development of drilling programs in Wyoming (USA), as well as Alberta (CANADA), where several more very intriguing prospects, that include existing production, are developing rapidly. Emerson will announce further details as lease opportunities and contract negotiations come to fruition.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for drilling programs involves existing production of oil and or gas opportunities, as well as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very optimistic that with its current deal flow it will be able to build a solid foundation to grow.

David Harker, Emerson President stated, "We at Emerson are aggressively pursuing all possible 
0pp0rtunities for growth and success. We believe that in many situations we will have the 
0pp0rtunity to include existing production in a drilling program, which will always encourage the participation of financial partners."

Price - .09

The value of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-millions, EOGI is selling for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particular|y close attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l company
with a comparably smal| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia|ly with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But all that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wi|l the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or decline
slightly, you wi|l stil| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings wil|
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be staggering.

Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wi|| surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are we|| established and are going into massive production.
Early investors will secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in this
area will really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu|letin.
