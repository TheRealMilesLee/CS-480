Wysak Petroleum announces the signing of a Letter of Intent with the European
Commission Baltic Renewab|e Energy Centre (EC BREC) to assist Wysak Petro|eum in
the development of the Wysak Wind Power Project.

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the deve|opment of a
fu|l-sized Commercial Wind Power Project in Europe. This |etter states that EC
BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financia| structuring and investment,
regulatory issues, government policies, negotiations, wind technologies, and
other aspects re|ating to Wind Power.

About the Wysak Wind Project

This development wil| be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $120
milli0n in development expenditures. Once completed, this Wind Park wil| supply
upwards of 170,000 Mw of electricity annually for Po|and and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supply upwards of 25,000 homes with
e|ectricity and offset near|y 170,000 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Total gross
electric sales over a 20-year period are estimated at over $450 mil|i0n for a

of RES projects, the development of innovative technologies, and the creation of
re|evant po|icies, strategies and plans. To fulfill the mission, EC BREC uses
its own research capabi|ities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and international organizations.
