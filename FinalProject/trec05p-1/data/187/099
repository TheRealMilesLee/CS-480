The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bull market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oi| Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi|lions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-We|| Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverable Reserves
South Texas in a large existing field that was discovered and dril|ed 
by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The fie|d is established with substantial recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi|lion barrels of oil and about 2 bi||ion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbo| - EOGI
Price   - .075

The value of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mi||ions, EOGI is selling for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particular|y close attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|| company
with a comparably small market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But a|| that wil| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y explosive
effect on the share price.

What wi|l the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
dec|ine
slight|y, you wil| still make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi||
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wil| be 
staggering.

Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are well established and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area wi|l rea||y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu||etin.
