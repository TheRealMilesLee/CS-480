First off Happy New Year's to all you guys!   Most of you already have
the 
dates and other information about our Whistler trip this year but I
wanted 
to make sure you had all the details for this year's extravaganza.   For

those of you that went last year you know the drill.  I pay for 
accomodations and meals (and we will eat at some nice places!).  You 
arrange your own transportation, lift tickets and ski rental (all of
which 
can be done on arrival and cost under 150 US dollars).

Here are the details:

Dates:   Jan 31st thru Feb. 3

I arrive thursday Jan. 31 12:50 pm on horizon air. (then taking the 2:30

star express to whistler, arrive 4:30)

Shuttle to whistler:  Whistler star express:  phone #(604) 266-5386

Condo: Woodrun  3bd/2bath with den.  (near chateau whistler)  The
shuttle 
will drop you off at or near woodrun.

Lift tickets and ski rental:   All can be taken care of on arrival at 
nearby Chateau Whistler.

If I left anything out let me know.

Look forward to a great trip,


Ed
