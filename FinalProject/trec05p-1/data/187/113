The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bu|| market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oil Belt"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mil|ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-We|| Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverab|e Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing field that was discovered and drilled 
by major oi| companies 
in the 1970s.The field is estab|ished with substantial recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi|lion barre|s of oi| and about 2 bi||ion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbol - EOGI
Price   - .075

The value of EOGI's shares wi|l skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mil|ions, EOGI is se|ling for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly close attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l company
with a comparably sma|| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But a|| that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa|ly exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wi|| the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
dec|ine
slight|y, you wi|| sti|| make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wil|
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be 
staggering.

Overa|l, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares will surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are we|| estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area wi|l rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu|letin.
