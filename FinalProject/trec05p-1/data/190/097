I think that we are better off just conveying the clean LSE over to NETCO and then registering as an REP in the event we need to. The QSE needs to be re done as the last one is messy.

Thanks,

Doug

I am researching with ERCOT staff, the timing requirements for QSE, LSE and TCR registration.  They are not on the website.
