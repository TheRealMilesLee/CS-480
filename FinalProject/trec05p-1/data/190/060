I did talk to Gas Measurement and they are only showing 4 hours of flow on the 5th, I'm not sure about the 6th . Verlene is checking with the measurement techs. and they'll probably  have to poll the stations again to get the volumes into the system correctly.

There looks like there are some measurment problems.  Therefore this report has not been done for these days.  Checking with measurement regarding the variances between scheduled and actuals
