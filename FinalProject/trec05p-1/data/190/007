Note, this log is slightly different from Clara's file--it does not include the A/R and A/P items.  But, we will be updating that spreadsheet as well today.  I've gone through the Termination letters that I could find, and have updated the sheet accordingly.  

If a collateral amount shows as a negative number, it means Enron has posted the money.  This is why in the "Amount" column you will see a negative valuation owed by Enron, negative collateral, and a smaller net negative amount due.  

Please call if you have any questions.
