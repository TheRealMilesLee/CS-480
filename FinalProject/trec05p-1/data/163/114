Steve,

For DETM:  Theresa Branney  tmbranney@duke-energy.com
For Mirant: Roger Lee and/or Dave Thomas  (I will pass along the particulars of the conference call to each)
For PanCanadian: Stewart Vaughan  Stewart_Vaughan@PanCanadianEnergy.com

As we discussed today, each company may add to or change their representatives during the course of the Team's deliberations.  To that end, it would be helpful if Northern and the customer representatives on the team could consider holding meetings in the afternoon, after the morning trading rush.


Please include me on the e-mail distribution list for all notices, documents, materials, etc. generated by the Team.

Thanks,


Gordon Smith
