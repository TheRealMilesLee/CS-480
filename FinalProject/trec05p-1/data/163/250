Jeff,

Wasn't sure who "survived" in California, glad to hear you're still on board.  Given the Enron situation, what can you tell me about coverage in California?  Will you and/or any other Enron level employees cover the CPUC and legislative proceedings?  If appropriate, should Transwestern consider contracting a lobbyist, if yes, any recommendations?  We no longer have Mark Baldwin under contract due a conflict of interest.  With the new legislative session coming up after the first of the year, I just want to be prepared for what we need to do.  Any advice is appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

Glen
