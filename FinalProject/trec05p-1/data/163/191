Thanks, Kim.  Even with the letter, calls and specific conversation with oneof  NNG's large customer's Treasury group, Duke STILL send the wire to the Bank of America in error.  Go figure...  That's why we are taking the extra precautionary step of including marketing.  Thanks for your help.

Rick,

I called David Lanning with Agave, he will double check with his accounting folks to make sure they have the updated bank and account information.  

Thanks, Kim.

Steve,

I would like your assistance to ensure the timely collection of our transportation accounts receivables.  There is something your group can do to help assure the successful collection of Transwestern's $12,000,000 next week.  Please forward this email to the TW marketers and ask them to assist Gas Logistics in this process by having a conversation (similar to what is described below) with their marketing counterpart if they are the marketer for any of the customers listed below:
Please call your marketing counterpart and (after making some small talk about Enron) reassure them that Transwestern is fine and ongoing business will continue uninterrupted.  Then slip in that you understand that this is a busy time of the year and marketing normally doesn't get involved in payment issues unless there is some type of major problem, BUT, you have a different type of request/favor to ask of them.  You can tell them that with all of the changes at Enron lately, Transwestern moved the bank account that receives our wire transfer payments for our reservation, commodity and imbalance cash accounts.  Tell them that Gas Logistics posted the notice and the new account information on the web as well as included letters in with the reservation and commodity invoices mailed on December 3rd notifying them of this bank account change.  HOWEVER, you don't really know whether you can trust the "accounting geeks" or others who handle the details to have actually made the changes in their system to revise the bank information and that you are asking them to call internally within their company to follow up.  Please ask them specifically to pass along the new wiring instruction information as follows:
Bank Name:	Citibank, NA
Address:		New York, NY
ABA #:		021000089
Account #:		30454716
Beneficiary:	Transwestern Pipeline		

I almost feel like I need to apologize for asking you to place this redundant call, but we all understand the criticalness of receiving Transwestern's cash in our own bank account.  Thank you for the help and we will forward control reports to you next week.

Rick

Please distribute these procedures to the Transwestern Customer Service teams and explain to them the importance of collecting our transportation revenues on time.  If they need further clarification or have questions, please give me a call.
