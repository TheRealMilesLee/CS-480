Good morning Bill -

Please know that I have not forgotten, and in fact looked forward to, our 
meeting this afternoon.  I had hesitated in sending a reply only because the 
youngest developed a pretty nasty cough on Saturday.  He is prone to 
pneumonia so I have placed a call to his Dr. to see how this can be avoided.

I will have to read the other e-mail but I am thinking that you mentioned 
that lunch Wednesday might work for you also?  I do not expect to have to 
stay home with Tad 2 for more than today and my lunch schedule is pretty 
open.  Perhaps you could look at your calendar and see if there is another 
day that would work for you?

Many thanks for understanding - much appreciated on my end - Lili
