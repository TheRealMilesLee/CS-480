> >The young boy was apologetic. "Please mister...
>please, I'm sorry... I didn't
>know what else to do," he pleaded. "I threw the brick
>because no one else would stop..." With tears dripping
>down his face and off his chin, the youth pointed
>to a spot just around a parked car. "It's my brother,"
>he said. "He rolled off
>the curb and fell out of his wheelchair and I can't

> >Moved beyond words, the driver tried to swallow the

>back into the wheelchair,
>then took out his fancy handkerchief and dabbed at the
>fresh scrapes and cuts. A
>quick look told him everything was going to be okay.
>"Thank you and may God
>bless you," the grateful child told the stranger.

> >Too shook up for words, the man simply watched the

> >It was a long, slow walk back to the Jaguar. The
>damage was very noticeable, but the driver never
>bothered to repair the dented side door. He kept the

>there to remind him of this message: Don't go through
>life so fast that someone
>has to throw a brick at you to get your attention!

> >God whispers in our souls and speaks to our hearts.
>Sometimes when we don't
>have time to listen, He has to throw a brick at us.
>It's our choice: Listen to
