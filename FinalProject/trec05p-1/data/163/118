Hey, strange,,, While I was biking home from the Thanksgiving Day Parade
downtown, I came across a gasoline-powered weed eater (or something like
that) dead in the middle of the street, in front of some townhomes, on
Dennis down around Bagby or Helena.  I picked it up and moved into the
courtyard of the townhomes, which for some reason had left their driveway
gate open.  I hope I got it back to the right homeowner, but in case
someone's missing one, you might check with that set of townhomes.

Incidentaly, about a year ago, I came up missing  a small electric
Black&Decker hedge trimmer.  I have no idea how it was taken, because I
NEVER turn my back on tools while I'm out working.  But anyway, it's gone.
If anyone has come across it, I sure would like to have it back.
