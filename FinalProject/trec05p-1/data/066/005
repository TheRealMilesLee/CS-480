Top of the morning to ya

Yes its true !!

Some have heard the rumor but have no fear " Stumptown 
bike and brew " is coming to a neighborhood near.

We did a "test ride" the other weekend and this drunken 
debacle proved to be quality mahem for sure.

Just to give you an idea for Saturday.  The test ride 
was out to Alameda Brewery, Lauralwood brewery, Moon and 
Six Pence, Goodfoot and then "we closed up Dots".

You can meet us while on the ride if 3 is a bad time, 
we'll be out for the night.

Any questions, give a call,

Cheers,

PK

SATURDAY, OCT 6:  SECOND INCEDENT OF THE BICYCLY PUB CRAWL/MALAY!

THE OBJECTIVE:
A band of geeks on bikes tours a loose agenda of multiple micro brewpubs 
with eager attention to quality beer and bad humor.  General chaos, mayhem 
and entropy is predicted and encouraged.  It's an amalgamation of those 
invited directly, indirectly and whoever is taken hostage.  Quaility of beer 
is usually maintained throughout the endeavour, although reputation of 
drinking establishments deteriorates.  Pimpin' hot tub available afterhours 
at homebase for post-event analysis.

THE RENDEZVOUS:
Meet Saturday, Oct. 6, 3:00 at home of Phil, hiram, John and Brian. (2921 SE 
Franklin Av: Up Hawthorne, Right onto SE 20th, Left onto Division, Right 
onto SE 29th, past Clinton & Broklyn and left onto Franklin). (503) 236-3342 
if you're lost.

Keg will be tapped, bikestand available for last minute repairs and our cat 
and dog will be fighting in the driveway for pre-game entertainment.  
Pre-game activities will also include...

BICYCLE HOOD ORNAMENTS!
Bring your favorite Lego Man, rubber sqeeky animal or StarWars figure.  
Everyone rides better with a Mojo!  Glue and Zip-ties will be provided.

WHAT TO BRING:
-Rubber chickens and hood ornaments.
-Yes, you must have a bike!  (Duh!...Just steal your roomate's!)
-For Chrissake, bring a helmut...If you don't, you probably didn't have that 
much to protect anyhow.
-It'll get dark and bikes are invisible so lights are wise
-Darts are handy at a couple of pubs.
-Yes you CAN get a DUI on a bike but has that ever actually stopped you?
