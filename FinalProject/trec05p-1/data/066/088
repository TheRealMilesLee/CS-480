deployed throughout China to fu|fill a need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critica| areas for a country with a population 
exceeding 1.3 bi||ion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a

nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's sti|| a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated release of huge news announcements wi|l add to the 
buying frenzy from investors loading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
