Letter from the Editor:

Traditionally, the month approaching is a time for us to wrap up projects
before the year comes to a close.

Parties and social affairs come to the fore, and business begins to become
less important in our lives ... well, just a little less important anyway.

And we here at HoustonChronicle.com hope that all of you who read this
newsletter enjoy this traditional approach to the end of the year this year
especially.

But for us, it's going to be a little busier than usual, and we just wanted
to give you a little advance notice that we are working as hard as we can
to provide some rather major changes to the site by the start of the new
year.

Some of the sources we use for some major parts of the site are not going
to be available after the end of the year, and we are trying to make their
loss as inconspicuous as we can.

The Web site always has been somewhat under construction, but the pace is
going to be a little heavier than normal between now and the end of the
year.

We've already made some of the changes in the new Arts and Entertainment
area, and more will be coming in the weeks ahead.

And we know that despite our best efforts, some of you will find some of
your favorite pieces of the site will change. Rest assured, we are trying
to make things better, not just different.

But do contact us if one of the changes really affects something important
to you. We need to know, and we will try our best to come up with solutions
as quickly as possible to minimize the upset.

Thanks for visiting, and please try not to run into any construction
barricades.

**Goodfellows

The Thanksgiving-Yule holiday season is one when traditionally we devote
some of our thoughts and efforts to those less fortunate than ourselves.

This year especially, there are plenty of folks less fortunate than us to
be thinking about.

Each year, the Chronicle sponsors a community-wide effort to brighten the
season for families throughout the area as part of our Goodfellows program.
It's a project for all of us here, with a lot of help from our readers and
our friends.

We've set up an online site where you can join in and contribute to the
effort. Or let us know of a family that needs help. Or just find out more
about the program. Or, as the season continues, learn more about the
problems some of our neighbors face in their lives.

This is a different kind of interactivity from what we generally think of
on a Web site. But it spreads our reach, and you might brighten your own
season while helping to brighten that of someone else.

Help us help this holiday at:

*What's New at HoustonChronicle.com

**Runoff Elections

One more week of campaigning before Houston voters settle the political
contests left undesided from the November balloting. 

Foremost among these races is the contest between Mayor Lee P. Brown and
City Councilman Orlando Sanchez for the city's top elected postion. 

Early voting continues through Tuesday, and election day will be Dec. 1.

**Archives Access for Non-Subscribers

For a couple of year now, the online archives of the Houston Chronicle and
the Houston Post have been open to Houston Chronicle subscribers. Those of
the Post are offline for some review right now. And HoustonChronicle.com
has partnered with Qpass to provide an easy and safe way for
non-subscribers to purchase access to archival material online.

Three kinds of passes allow non-subscribers to search the archives. One is
for 30 days, another for seven days, and a third lasts for 24 hours.  To
buy a pass and start a search, simply go to

http://www.HoustonChronicle.com/archives

That site also includes answers to any questions you might have about
this new service.

Please note that the Houston Chronicle archives includes only text of
news articles appearing in the Chronicle starting in 1985. It does not
include photographs, classified ads or paid death notices. As part of the
SubscribersADVANTAGE program, the archives remain free to Houston Chronicle
subscribers.
