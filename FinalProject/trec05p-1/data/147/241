Dear Friend.

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I belie=
ve
everyone will die someday.

My name is Kareem Jabaar, a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been d=
iagnosed
with Esophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, an=
d
right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical ex=
perts.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared fo=
r
anyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was neve=
r
generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business
as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I no=
w
know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the=

money in the world.

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would=

live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has c=
alled
me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediat=
e
and extended family members as well as a few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to
give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charit=
y
organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.

I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distrib=
ute
the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Paki=
stan,
they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them=

anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.=


The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of fi=
ve
million dollars $5,000,000that I have with a finance/Security Company abr=
oad.
I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to char=
ity
organizations.

 I have set aside 20% for you for your time and patience.please send a re=
ply
through this email address (kjabaar@netscape.net) with your full contact
information for more private and confidential communication.

God be with you.

Kareem Jabaar
