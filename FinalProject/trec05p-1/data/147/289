       REQUEST FOR URGENT ASSISTANCE/INVESTMENT. 

DEAR FRIEND, 

This may appear a bit surprising to you but very beneficial; as a matter of urgentcy,
i am desparately looking for a foriegn partner whom i can trust tohandle some 
investmentor fund movement. I am MRS Mackintosh, Malcom,shengi.wife of late
MR.Malcom Kenneth Mackintosh, who was murdered by the Zimbabwean veterans and irrate blackpeople. 

I am writing from Zimbabwe. I got your address from the internet through the 
consultancy directory during my searchfor a reliable and honest person to transact
this business with.I write to solicit for your special assistance to a family 
shattered by a tyrannical government led by a dictator and his (ZANU-PF) ruling
party- president Robert Mugabe. 

Because of land and farm land crisis in Zimbabwe, the government secretly sponsored 
the war veterans and someirrate party members to disposess the land being occupied 
by white farmers.This action has led to the killing of some members of opposition 
party including my husband(Malcom Kenneth Mackintosh),for more infromation go to 
this sites ;www.zimbabwesituation.com/farmilist.html, page 2 no 776 428  

But before the death of my husband, he anticipated some dangers and so he deposited
the sum ofUS$15.4m (Fifteen million four hundered Thousand United States Dollars)in 
the name of our only son KENNETH JN  with the help of reputable security company in 
south Africa with the intention of using it to open fertilizer manufacturing company among other companies in our neighbouring country (Swaziland)after his university education. 

On the 29th of June 2000, the war veterans and some supporters of (ZANU-PF)ruling 
party trooped into our compound and axed him(my husband) to death. Since then, they
have been terrorizing my only son, KENNETH MACKKINTOSH, but he managed to escape to 
a neighbouring country, South Africa as a political asylum seeker (refugee). 
But his position in South Africa does not permit him to open an account or run any 
huge financial business. 

That is why I want this fund to be transferred into your private account so that you 
will assist him to invest it in your country. Hence,if you agree to assist us, we 
will offer you 20% of the money for your assistance, 10% will befor the possible 
expenses incurred in the process of this transaction, while 70% will be for our family investment in
your country through your assistance. I need your urgent and confidential response. 

Best regards, 
MRS Mackintosh Malcom .S. 
FOR THE FAMILY 

Upon your immediate response, I will immediately arrange and send to you all the 
informations that will empower your  good self in finalizing the transaction with
the security company in south Africa I will also send to you the agreement that  
will protect both interest. And also further information about yourself is necessary 
for i can not play on this.
