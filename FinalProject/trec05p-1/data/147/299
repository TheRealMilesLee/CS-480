Due to the unplanned outage of the Gerber Compressor Station, California Gas Transmission's maximum system inventory limit is capped at 4,500 MMcf. Because the outage was a force majeure event, this upper limit will be in place immediately. The outage is expected to last approximately six months. 
Today's maximum system inventory limit is already 4,500 MMcf because total system demand is low. If total system demand increases above 2,800 MMcf, the maximum system inventory limit would normally be raised to 4,600 MMcf. Instead, it will remain at 4,500 until Gerber can be brought back online.
