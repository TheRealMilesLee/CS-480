In the CPUC's meeting today, the Commission approved the proposed RLS/Peaking tariff which provides for a bypass peaking rate when customers bypass their system except for peaking service.  It appears they approved the June 19th Proposed Decision which establishes a cost based rate made up of four components--Customer Charge, Public Purpose Program charge, Reservation Charge and a volumetric Interstate Transition Cost Surcharge.  As soon as the Order is published I'll review the final Order and advise if this is still true or if any changes were made.  SoCal will have 10 days from the Order to file an Advice Letter with conforming tariff sheets.
