Dear Michael,

It was good talking with you too.  I look forward to working with you.  To get you started, I will email the presentation you sat through last week - it is long, but has a tremendous amount on useful info (especially the maps).  I am happy to answer questions or walk through parts of it when needed.

I will also send you some background material on our multi-emissions proposal.  Similarly, give me a ring is you have any questions.

Talk to you soon,

Lisa

Lisa,

It was great listening and learning from you this morning.  Obviously you are going to be a wealth of information.  

My e-mail address is michael.e.taylor@enron.com    (Just in case in is in a different form above)

I have mainly been focusing on NOx.  Very interested in anything concerning NOx.  I will be adding SO2 to my umbrella shortly.

A brief background on myself:

	Graduated Louisiana State University in Finance in May 2001
	Spent a few months at Microsoft Equity Trading Room and Gas Scheduling and Trading at Enron
	(Nothing related to Emissions at all)

Sincerely,
Michael Taylor
