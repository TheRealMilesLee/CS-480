Nope, but I would call up some of the SCR manufacturers, Babcock and Wilcox, ABB, GE.  Also, did you see the article in that same issue of Clean Air Compliance about AEP Ammonia on Demand.  It's gonna be all about urea baby.  I would figure out a strategy fast, after it's in a news article its pretty much too late.  As clueless as the NOXTech guys are it may be worth picking their brains to try to get some insight. Call me if you want to bounce some ideas around.

P.S. Wouldn't you want to buy ammonia if you think there is going to be more demand for it?

Got it.  Looks like the ammonia market is long and has a ton of diverse players.  Did you do analysis on what the demand of the SCRs would be?  I'm wondering if we couldn't sell it as a hedge as opposed to a spec play.  The more SCRs the more ammonia goes up and the cost of allowances go down (in theory).

The link didn't work.  Is this in today's journal?  I'll forward you an email from Jeff Keeler.  Nobody here seems very concerned with her comments.  From our regulatory, to a few traders.
