Dear 

Naturally, this letter will come to you as a surprise since
we have not met, permit myself however, I am SUSAN BALOYI a
wife of Zimbabwean Farmer Mr. STEPHEN BALOYI 

I am contacting you as the need for me to have a foreign
partner in your country has become necessary due to my
plans to relocate and to establish a private company in
that region. 
 
As the present political instability in Zimbabwe, does not
encourage financial investment, as the environment is not
conducive for investment and most of all security is not
insured, just as reported by international media (CNN).

You will read more stories about President Mugabe's brutal
acts by visiting this web sites;

http://www.rte.ie/news/2000/0418/zimbabwe.html

My Husband was accused of Treason felony and also assisting
the White farmers in fighting the government. Few weeks
after his arrest, he was reported dead.

This problem started when the Zimbabwean government under
the leadership of President Robert Mugabe announced a
degree on May 31st 2000 to seize land more than 849
white-owned farms. So far, more than 1,400 white owned
farms have been invaded and confiscated, as well as
claiming the properties of the farmers. 

Therefore, I decided to contact you, for your assistance,
so that I can establish a company in your country and
relocate there, hence the president have killed my husband
during this situation.
 
The amount involved is US$8.2 Million Dollars,(Eight
Million two hundred thousand  dollars only.) upon receiving
this money on my behalf, in your account which will be used
for Investment, I shall be joining you in your country. My
late husband left this fortune for my children and me in a
security and trust company in South Africa.
 
As a partner you will be entitled to 20% of the total sum.
And 5% shall be for the expense, which might occur in the
cause of this transaction. 

I am waiting urgently for your call or email through this.
Please contact my son and myself..

Cheers and God bless. 
Best Regards, 
 
Madam Susan Baloyi
