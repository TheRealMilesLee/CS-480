Every day at Enron I learn to be a little less modest.  I am not there yet, but I keep on trying.

In terms of $s, we can add $30 million to our receivables.  I will try to get the backup from Chris Stokley.

$30 million bucks!!!  I would have hoped for 10 times this amount, but it's still 30 million bucks.  Legal and Settlements should get origination credit for this.  Let me know when the ISO's check clears.---Steve

This is based on the settlement statements that the ISO sent me.
