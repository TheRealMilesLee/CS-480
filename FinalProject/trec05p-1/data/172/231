Hello,

I thought I'd write and see how you are doing?  How is the move going?  I'm still working on sending additional pictures.  We had our company Christmas party last weekend and I thought pictures would be taken.  They weren't so I'll have to come up with another plan.

The snow has been falling in the mountains here lately, and the skiing is turning out to be quite good.  Do you ski?  I've only been up a couple of times this year but I'd like to go more.  I think I may try and go here towards the end of this week.

How's the weather in AZ?  I bet it's great this time of year.  

I wanted to get back in touch, so write back when you get a chance.  


Paul
