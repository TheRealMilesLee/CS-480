Well, they say you'll never live if you never take a chance - 

Just thought I'd drop you a note and see if you reciprocate?

The following is my profile text:

OK - let's cover the basics in the right order: Am I physically attractive and sensual? Oh, yes. Is it all of who I am? Oh, no! I am an intelligent, authentic, generous, honest woman who's ready to start meeting new people again.... I like all the regular stuff (movies, theatre, travel, etc) and LOVE music, wine and great friends. I value sincerity, dependability, enlightened minds, and those interested in learning something new everyday, including new insights about themselves. I am fun, witty, and willing to try anything once. "You shine brightly" in the recent words of a friend. I try very hard to stay grounded in the present, as opposed to dwelling on the past or worrying needlessly about the future. I believe that's "life's too short" and "everything happens for a reason." On one hand, I've recently begun amassing a small body of knowledge about wine, but on the other hand, I can enjoy playing some flag football or just grabbing some take-out and renting a video. I have my kids 50% of the time and when I do, they are my priority. My schedule is flexible, however, and when I'm free, I like to stay busy, being with friends, meeting new people and trying new things. Honestly, I think you'll find me to be a pleasant breath of fresh air in a world of mediocrity and uncertainty. (I dare you!.....lol)
