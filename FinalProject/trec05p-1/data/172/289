FROM THE OFFICE OFTHE ACCOUNTS DEPT PETROLEUM TRUST FUND 
{PTF} PLOT 34-48 JOHN .F. KENEDY OFF PTF PRESIDENCIAL VILLA VICTORIA 
ISLAND. 

DEAR SIR/MADAM, 

I am Fedrick Henry of the accounts department of the 
petroleum {special} trust fund {PTF} an institution established by the 
federal government to manage the proceeds from the sale of petroleum 
products as well as the application of the funds in contracts execution. 
My colleages and i are inclined to contact you in view of a high level 
business {deal} that we want to strike with you, it is quite natural to 
be suprised when some body you do not know contacts you especially 
when it comes to a business of this type. The choice of picking you for the 
deal is based on satisfactory enquiries and reports that we gatherd 
about your person,The sourse of our information shall be disclosed to 
you in the coures of this transaction. 
The deal stems from an over-valued invoice of a contract executed in 
our institution P.T.F for the up-grading of facilities in our refineries, 
The actual contract valued was USD$40.5 Milion, but at the point of 
approval, it was deliberately inflated to USD$60.8 Million, which was 
approved as such, the contract has since been executed and the 
original German contractor has been paid the actual contract value of
 USD$40.5 Million which is the only money due to him, The over-valued sum of 
USD$20.3 Million still hanging in our system unclaimed.This is the deal and 
this is where we want you to come in, as appointees within the system
,we have since perfected arrangement through which 
the fund {USD$20.3 Million} can be transferred out.How ever, the only 
way this can be done successfully is with the collaboration of an 
oversea partner, it has to be so, since it is a foreign denominated contract 
the destination of the fund must be an oversea account and we the top 
officials of the institution are not permitted to operate a foreing 
account so to avoid suspicion of any sort.Thus the only condition under 
which the deal will be prosecuted is for it to be kept in absolute secretcy 
and confidentiality.I hope that you will give us this 
all-important guarantee otherwise there will be no need of starting in 
the first place, But if the secrecy can be kept by you, then i"ll require you to 
provide us with the following information to enable us obtain the necessary 
approvals and authourization for the transfer of the fund. 
1. Your private telephone and fax number. 
2. Your name in full. 
3. Your occupation. 
This will be used to facilitate the transaction.Since it is a 
deal, we intend all the parties involved to have commensurate share of 
the fund when it gets to your account.this our hope that it is something 
that would be finally agreed upon as we get started for now we 
proposed as follows; 
1.We the officials 60%
2.charity organization 15% 
3.Account owner 25% 
In conclusion, as we go on in the transaction you will also have to 
advice us on the type of investment in your 
country, that we could put our own share into, as we do not intend to 
bring back our own entire share to our country. Your early response 
will be highly appreciated. 

In God we trust, 
Fedrick Henry.
