Paul,
Hi. I never got your email, but I do remember emailing you. I'm a little 
under the weather today and I am heading to bed. I think I have the dreaded 
winter cold, yuck! I will write more tomorrow, but wanted to let you know, 
that I did get this email. I look forward to talking with you more.
Valerie
