Hey (insert name here),

Thank you for your response, it's very nice to meet you!  By the way, my name is Tracy or you can call me tp081996, ha ha!  So, what was it about me that caught your attention anyway?  Have you dated many women off of the Internet?  What has been your best/worst dating experience?  Are you originally from CO or elsewhere?  Please tell me a little more about yourself as I'm interested in getting to know you!

Take care,

Tracy
