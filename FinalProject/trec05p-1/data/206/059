Have been reading a little about Hedge Funds (their drivers, etc.) and our ability to cater to their needs looks promising - the current energy landscape and the markets' reactions to them can only help.  Will summarize all my learning's over the next couple of weeks and send them to you.  Maybe we can originate a few new products catering specifically to this sector.

Hope you managed to get some sleep last weekend.
