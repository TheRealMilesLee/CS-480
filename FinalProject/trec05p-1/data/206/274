As we discussed today, since we don't know anymore today than we did when we made the original estimate, you can assume this is still a good estimate to take it to FERC application stage.

Doug--
	We are working up a proposal for APS in Phoenix wherein they would share in a portion of the costs we incur to get the project's FERC application ready.  Tab 5 of the original cost book shows a cost of $8,750,301.  Is this still a good number to use for our APS proposal?  Let's talk Wed 1/23 if possible.  

thanks
