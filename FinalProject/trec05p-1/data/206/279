This just in (at 1pm Central Time) --
 
High School All-American runningback David Horne from Omaha Central choose Nebraska over Michigan.  He also considered Notre Dame, Colorado, and Iowa.
 
Needless to say, this is a huge get for the Huskers.
 
 
From today's Lincoln Journal Star:
 
Omaha Central's David Horne, ranked by rivals100.com as the nation's No. 6 running back, has scheduled a 1 p.m. press conference today at his school to announce his decision. He recently narrowed his list to Nebraska and Michigan. 

"I think he'll end up at Nebraska," Central Coach Joe McMenamin said Tuesday night. "But he's got a cousin at Michigan, and that plays into it. The one thing David knows is he wants to make his decision and be done with it." 

The 6-foot, 195-pound Horne runs the 40-yard dash in 4.4 seconds and has a 34-inch vertical leap. He recently canceled recruiting trips to Iowa and Notre Dame after eliminating Colorado as a finalist.
