I think we're a go for the May/June time frame.  Kim was supposed to
start
checking airfares yesterday on her MLK holiday off, but got busy doing
other
things.

Maybe we can rally late afternoon on Sunday to get this ball rolling.

John

I'm not sure how clear Judy was when Kim ask if we liked IT in late
May/early June as opposed to Sept.

Our baby-sitter options are much greater when kids are out of school.
Sept
wipes out Judy's Mom because she can't leave Ft. Worth and puts us in
competition with Jo Lynn (Mom has a trip to Guam sometime in the Fall)

Both are possible, but wanted to make sure you understood it was not 6
of 1
half dozen of another.

In training this week.  Only E-mailing on breaks.

Power and I at Battleship Texas Saturday.  Not sure what we're up to
Sunday.

Paul
