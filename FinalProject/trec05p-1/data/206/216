Shelley,
I'm currently at the loading dock loading equipment for the hanger. Did you have any questions regarding the GMS cost numbers I gave you yesterday. If so send me an email and I will come up before I leave for the hanger.

We will make some minor changes at the hanger but we will leave it up and ready to go.

Dale
