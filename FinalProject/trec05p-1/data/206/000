DEAR PARTNER, 

IN ORDER TO TRANSFER OUT ( FIFTEEN-MILLION  POUNDS STERLINGS) FROM OUR
BANK HERE IN LONDON. I HAVE THE COURAGE TO LOOK  FOR A RELIABLE AND
HONEST PERSON WHO WILL  BE CAPABLE FOR THIS IMPORTANT TRANSACTION,
BELIEVING THAT YOU WILL NEVER LET ME DOWN EITHER NOW OR IN  FUTURE.
I AM SIR CECIL WILLIAMS, THE AUDITOR AND COMPUTING STAFF OF A BANK HERE
IN SCOTLAND UNITED KINGDOM. THERE IS AN ACCOUNT OPENED IN THIS BANK IN
1995 AND  SINCE 2001 NOBODY HAS OPERATED ON THIS ACCOUNT AGAIN,  AFTER
GOING THROUGH SOME OLD FILES IN THE  RECORDS,  I DISCOVERED THAT IF I
DO NOT REMITT THIS MONEY OUT  URGENTLY, IT WILL BE FOR FEITED FOR
NOTHING. 

HOW THE MONEY CAME ABOUT: 

THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS MR JOHN HUGHES  FOREIGNER  AND THE MANAGER
OF PETROLCHEMICAL SERVICE HERE IN LONDON,  A CHEMICAL ENGINEER BY
PROFFESSION AND HE  DIED SINCE 1995.AND THEN,SINCE 2001, NOBODY KNOWS
ABOUT THIS  ACCOUNT OR ANYTHING CONCERNING IT, THEACCOUNT HAS NO  OTHER
BENEFICIARY AND MY INVESTIGATION  PROVED TO ME AS  WELL THAT HIS
COMPANY DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ACCOUNT AND THE
AMOUNTINVOLVED IS  (15,000,000.00) POUNDS STERLINGS. 

I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A SAFE  FOREIGN  ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT
I DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER, I AM  ONLY CONTACTING YOU AS A FOREIGNER
BECAUSE  THIS MONEY  CAN NOT BE APPROVED TO ANY LOCAL BANK HERE IN
SCOTLAND,BUT CAN  ONLY BE APPROVED TO ANY FOREIGN ACCOUNT  BECAUSE THE
MONEY IS  POUNDS STERLINGS AND THE FORMER OWNER OF THE  ACCOUNT IS JOHN
HUGHES AND HE WAS A  FOREIGNER  TOO. 

I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE WILL COME TO YOU  AS A  SURPRISE AS WE DON'T
KNOW OUR SELF BEFORE,BUT BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE
BUSINESS. I BELIEVE IN  GOD THAT YOU WILL NEVER LET ME DOWN IN THIS
INVESTMENT. 

WHEN THE TRANSFER IS APPROVED AND PAYMENT  SCHEDULE IS ALOCATED
OVERSEAS,THROUGH THE OFFSHORE PAYING  DELEGATE FOR FINAL CLEARANCE AND
SIGNING OF THE  PAYMENT REALEASE FORM BY THE BENEFICIARY, I WANT US TO
SEE AT THE OVERSEA PAYING CLEARANCE OFFICE FACE TO  FACE OR SIGNING OF
THE ORIGINAL BINDDING AGREEMENT TO  BIND US TOGETHER SO THAT,WE CAN
RECEIVE  THIS MONEY  INTO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT OR ANY ACCOUNT OF YOUR
CHOICE  WHERE THE FUND WILL BE REMITTED. 

I AM CONTACTING YOU BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO  INVOLVE A  FOREIGNER WITH A
FOREIGN ACCOUNT AS THE REAL  BENEFICIARY. I NEED YOUR CO-OPERATION TO
MAKE THIS  WORK FINE, BECAUSE THE MANAGEMENT IS READY TO APPROVE  THIS
PAYMENT TO ANY FOREIGNER WHO HAS THE  CORRECT  INFORMATION TO THIS
ACCOUNT,WHICH I WILL GIVE TO YOU  WHEN SURE OF YOUR CAPABILITY TO
HANDLE SUCH  AMOUNT IN  STRICT CONFIDENCE AND TRUST. 

ACCORDING TO MY INSTRUCTIONS AND MY ADVICE  FOR OUR  MUTUAL BENEFIT
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO MAKE ANY  MISTAKE, I NEED YOUR STRONG ASSURANCE
AND  TRUST. I  SHALL DESTROY ALL DOCUMENTS CONCERNING THIS TRANSACTIONS
IMMEDIATELY WE RECEIVED THIS  MONEY  LEAVING NO TRACE TO ANY PLACE.
I WILL USE MY POSITION AND INFLUENCE ON  OTHER STAFFS  TO EFFECT THE
LEGAL APPROVALS AND ONWARD TRANSFER OF  THIS MONEY TO YOUR ACCOUNT WITH
APPROPRIATE CLEARANCE  FROM FOREIGN PAYMENT DEPARTMENT. WITH ASSURANCE
THAT  THIS MONEY WILL BE INTACT PENDING MY  PHYSICAL ARRIVAL  TO YOUR
COUNTRY FOR THE SHARING AND OTHER INVESTMENT. 

PLEASE REPLY TO THIS E-MAIL ADDRESS:sircecilwilliams@yahoo.com 

THANKS
YOURS TRUELY
SIR CECIL WILLIAMS,
