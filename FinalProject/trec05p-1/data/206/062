Southwest Gas Data Fix

 

One of our users has correctly pointed out that there is a small bug in
the Location table of recent GPCMdat databases, which could cause some
confusion in some reports.

 

The bug was introduced when the Southwest Gas pipeline model was split
into two zones:  north and south.  In the location table Zone ZN194
became ZN194-N and ZN194-S.  Unfortunately, the Zone name "Southwest Gas
Corp." did not get the North and South appendages.  

 

So, the fix is really easy:  from Case Definition click the Data button
then the Location button.  Select Type "Trans" and then browse down to
the Southwest Gas Corp. entries and change them to Southwest Gas North
and Southwest Gas South respectively.  Then your reports will also read
correctly.

 

Thanks for letting us know about this!
