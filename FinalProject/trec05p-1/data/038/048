Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; Teach him to use the Net and he won't bother you for weeks. 



You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. . Big fish eat little fish. . If anything can go wrong, it will. . Shake the hand before you plough the field. .
Pride feels no pain. 

Speak softly and carry a cellular phone. 

no more?

.Ask no questions and hear no lies. . A burden in the bush is worth two in the hand. . A good thing is soon snatched up. .
What's the good of home, if you are never in it? . If you don't say it you will not have to unsay it. . Home is where you hang your @. .

He who wronged you will hate you. . As sick as a dog. . He is rich that is satisfied. .
