You asked me to look into this (the Ford sponsorship thing).

I think they will be unlikely to deliver on the benefits promised by M3 Management (their marketing consultant) and will add little value to our dealmaking opportunities with Ford.

I will pass the info. along to EES to see if they have any interest in paying the $7 million for general advertising exposure.
