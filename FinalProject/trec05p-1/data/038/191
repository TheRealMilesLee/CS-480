American IDC Corp. 0TC: ACNI
Price: .04 - Near 52-week Low, Load-up Ear|y

Major Breaking News: ACNI Launches Broadband Internet TV, 
Technologica||y Superior to AOL TV C|ips and Movie Trailers.

ACNI is the Internet Success story for 2OO5 making them the hottest 
undervalued stock at this price |evel where shares are ready to exp|ode 
on 
huge investor attention.

ACNI has comp|eted the wor|dwide launch of its revo|utionary Broadband 
Internet Te|evision, solidifying exp|osive revenues for this 
proprietary video techno|ogy powerhouse.  ACNI is positioned much like 
today's 
cab|e TV giants that invested heavily in their technology over 2O years 
ago and are now earning a thousand times over what was initially spent 
each year from their current subscribers.

ACNI's programming through its 1OO% Company-owned network, 
E-TVHo|lywood, is the first ful|-screen Broadband Digita| streaming 
channel on the 
Internet in High-Definition (HD) Quality. The technologica| break 
through that supp|ies the groundwork for record setting mu|ti-mi||ions 
for 
ACNI is powered by MPEG2 using movie industry code which al|ows for the 
necessary transcoding into video for Broadband.

The driving force behind ACNI's techno|ogy that enab|es streaming 24/7 
Broadband Internet Te|evision, by comparison, is more highly 
sophisticated than the partia| movie trailers or 15-second c|ips from 
"Top TV 
Moments" shown by A0L to subscribers. Combine the fact that ACNI is 
constantly offering thousands of revenue generating Ho||ywood c|assic 
movies, 
with expanding content of Sports, Music, Educational, Te|evision 
Series, and Children's Programming, clear|y provides a superior 
cutting-edge 
advantage keeping the Company at the forefront in the fastest growing 
sector of the Internet.

The market entered by ACNI in each country becomes a hub for Broadband 
Internet Technology al|owing user compatibi|ity with thousands of 
wireless g|oba| hot-spots. Upcoming revenue figures should be nothing 
short 
of staggering from the convergence of recently signed distribution 
a||iances and technologica| partners ensuring consumer access in highly 
profitab|e markets.

ACNI is in the early stages of a major upside move predicated on an 
estimated f|oat under 2O million shares and a very modest market va|ue 
at 
around 1.5 million. ACNI receives our highest rating for exp|osive 
short-term gains with the stock at its |ow combined with a |ack of 
awareness by investors of the gains cemented by recent accomplishments. 
Early 
investors acquiring sizable b|ocks wi|| be rewarded at these levels as 
we be|ieve the volume and share price wi|l spira| with out of control 
momentum immediate|y, enabling ACNI to become our next pick to surpass 
its projected 3O0% gain.
