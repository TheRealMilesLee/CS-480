DR.ASARA A. ASARA.
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT
CREDIT BANK BENIN
COTONOU-BENIN REPUBLIC
WEST AFRICA.
TEL/+229-88-98-16

MY DEAR,

I am DR.ASARA A. ASARA, the director in charge of auditing and accounting
section of Credit Bank Benin republic in West Africa with due respect and
regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will
be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction.

During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across
a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on 30th
january 2000 on Kenya Airways with aircraft Airbus 310-304 at location Abidjan,
Ivory Coast, with registration number 5Y-BEN while travelling with his entire
family, his wife, two children and a maid on a festive visit to Abidjan and
since his untimely death the funds has been dormant in his account with this
Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family
or relation before our discovery to this development.

Although personally, I kept this information secret within myself and partners
to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the
time of execution. The said amount was USD$24.1M (twenty four Million one
Hundred Thousand united states dollars).

As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through
my good friend who works with chamber of commerce on foreign business relations
here in Cotonou-Benin, it is him who recommended your person to me to be
viable and capable to champion a business of such magnitude without any problem.

Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide
next of kin to the deceased and get the required approval and transfer this
money to a foreign account has been put in place, all directives and needed
information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest
and willingness to assist us and also benefit yourself to this great business
opportunity.

In fact i could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this
country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account
and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer
because i work in this bank. 

This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who
will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign
account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request
as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent
branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your
own designated bank account.

May i at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as
i have made all arrangements for a successful transaction as an insider of
the bank before contacting you.

On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of
the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care
of any expenses that may arise during the time of transfer like telephone
bills, fax and our travel tickets to come over to your country for the sharing
of the fund while 60% will be for me and my partners.

Please you have been advised to keep this a top secret as we are still in
service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with
you.

I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm
the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent
sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further
investment either in your country or any country you will advice us to invest
in.

All other necessary information will be sent to you on your acceptance to
champion this transaction with me. 

I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible or you contact me on my
private line +229 88 98 16 stating your wish in this deal.

Yours Faithfully,
DR.ASARA A. ASARA
