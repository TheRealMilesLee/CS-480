Ah yes, the old CEMS file.  Unfortunately there is not fast way to update it.  The information can be found in Powerdat, and in other various industry publications (if a company or plant gets acquired), SEC filings, etc.  Be careful if you change the file, the program that generates the SO2 reports uses it, and the format has to be the same for the program to read it.  Also, the ATS sheet has to be changed accordingly otherwise the allowance accounts won't match the emissions.  If you need help, feel free to give me a call, or the guy in IT who wrote the code for the program is Wade Wells, he knows the technical stuff if the program stops working.  Trevor tells me the cranes didn't work out, but it doesn't seem to much matter with the compliance date pushed back to 2004.  We'll get 'em on the next one.

Adam,

The CEMS ownership file under the SO2_Reprot folder.  Where did you get that info?  What do you think is the best way to update it?

Thanks,
