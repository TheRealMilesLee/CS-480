Fresh from her shower, a woman stands in front of the mirror reviewing her
figure, complaining to her husband that her breasts are too small.

Instead of his standard response of reassuring her that wasn't the case,
her
husband uncharacteristically comes up with a suggestion......

"If you want your breasts to grow, then every day take a piece of toilet
paper and rub it between your breasts for a few seconds."

Willing to try anything, the wife fetches a piece of toilet paper, and
stands
in front of the mirror, rubbing it between her breasts.

"How long will this take?" she asks.

"Oh, they'll grow larger over a period of years," he replies.

The wife stops and looks at him inquisitively. "Why do you think rubbing a
piece of toilet paper between my breasts every day will make them grow over
the years?"

"Worked for your ass, didn't it?"

He lived, and with a great deal of therapy, he may even walk again.
