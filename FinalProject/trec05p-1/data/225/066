Subject:	FW: Transwestern Pipeline Payment Under Protest (Confirmed PAYMENT BY MAIL ONLY   -  $356,736.95)

Rod and Tracy,

As a result of a state of Colorado audit TW has been assessed tax (+penalties and interest) for compressor fuel use ($.4mm), and on the purchase of a La Plata facility ($1.3mm). We are protesting. However, it has been recommended, and I concur, that we pay
the compressor fuel use assessment ("under protest") to stop interest accruals on the use tax assessment. We believe the sales tax assessment is at best -weak- and therefore do not recommend any payment.

We're requesting approval to cut a check to the Colorado Dept of Revenue for $356,736.95.  
This payment would be a deferred expense until the protest is fully resolved.
