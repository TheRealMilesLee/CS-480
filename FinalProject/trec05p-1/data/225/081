David, 
Here is our efficiency analysis from the online model.  This is just for the Bisti to Gallup section. The other sections have comparable results.
You can see that before the pigging the average efficiency were at 1.005 and after the pigging it rose to 1.04. Thus, a 4% increase in efficiency. However I see a gradual decreasing trend towards 1.035 just less than a week after the pigging.
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Ben, I understand the team collected pressure data at the mainline valves on the SJ lateral and forwarded to you all Tuesday.  Have you had the opportunity to calculate the current eff. following the dry pig run made last week?

Gallup, please provide digital pictures if possible and of course quantities of liquids and/or solids received.

Ben, I assume you be able to provide the post pigging effeciency on the lateral so we can continue to evaluate the timing of the DRA application?
