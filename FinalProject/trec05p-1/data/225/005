Hi, our names are mark and tina Haller-Wade.  we are friends with Liz
Gras and we are adopting Anastasia. we  are hoping to adopt a second
child in Tarza while we are there.  We are very interested in Aigerim,
but we want to wait until we visit, meet, and introduce Anastasia to
Aigerim before we decide 100%.  She is the highest on the list of
choices.  we want a child that is close to Anastasia age so they can
play together.
We would really appreciate it if you would tell us about Aigerim and
please send us the pictures.  OUr address is PO Box 1646 Frazier Park,
CA 93225.  thanks so much for your time, mark and tina
