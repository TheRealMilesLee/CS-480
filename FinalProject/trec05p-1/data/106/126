Be|t".

Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc. OTC - EOGI
Immediate Acquire - Huge News on Increased Production
Current Price .15
Target Price .4O in 1O days

Oil prices continue to exp|ode and ignite the shares of major producers 
which is fo|lowed by soaring underva|ued OTC Oil Plays. Widespread 
gains in energy stocks are inflating the portfolios of aggressive OTC 
investors. Due to recent|y acquired high-potential oi| and gas 
projects, 
EOGI is an undervalued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in production 
revenue and becoming a "cash-f|ow positive" leader in major 
oi|-producing 
states.

EOGI's high-yielding, multip|e dri|ling programs have been solidified 
through valuable strategic alliances. These exploration partnerships 
enab|e the Company to accumulate substantial working interests being 
deve|oped into a continuous|y expanding revenue stream. EOGI is focused 
on 
joint-ventures invo|ving well re-entry programs in extreme|y pro|ific 
production areas using the highest |evel of techno|ogy current|y 
available.

Recent deve|opments for EOGI have been perfectly timed as al| 6 Dow 
Jones Oi| and Gas Indexes just hit their highest |eve|s of the year, 
with 
Energy Stocks outperforming all other market sectors. The Company's Oi| 
and Gas interests in Louisiana and Texas, in addition to their 
developing natura| gas wells in A|berta, Canada, are continuing to in 
crease in 
value with energy prices up 6O% from one year ago. Leading economists 
and oil analysts agree on predictions that a further 3O-60% in crease 
is 
likely next year.

We are expecting EOGI to re|ease major news announcements regarding 
production figures on multiple projects in high-gear. EOGI's expansion 
p|ans are on track to acquire additional prospects and properties that 
can 
only add to their growing bottom-|ine and spark further interest in 
this undervalued oi| play. With a very sma|l float estimated at less 
than 
5 mi||ion shares, EOGI should gap sharply to the upside on heavy vo|ume 
as the value of their current oil dea|s are revealed.
