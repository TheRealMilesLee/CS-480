                   BUSINESS TRANSACTION.

DEAR FRIEND,

MY NAME IS JOHNSON NDIOVU, THE ELDEST SON OF MR.AKUGA NDIOVU OF ZIMBABWE IT
MIGHT BE A SURPRISE TO YOU, WHERE I GOT YOUR CONTACT ADDRESS. I GOT IT FROM
THE INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRIES.

DURING THE CRISIS AGAINST THE WHITE FARMERS IN ZIMBABWE BY THE SUPPORTERS OF
OUR PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE TO CLAIM ALL THE WHITE OWNED FARMERS IN OUR
COUNTRY, HE ORDERED ALL WHITE FARMERS TO SURRENDER THEIR FARMS TO HIS PARTY
MEMBERS AND THEIR FOLLOWERS.

MY FATHER WAS ONE OF THE BEST FARMERS IN THE COUNTRY AND KNOWING THAT HE DID
NOT SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT POLITICAL IDEOLOGY, THE PRESIDENT'S SUPPORTERS
INVADED MY FATHER'S FARM AND BURNT DOWN EVERYTHING, SHOT HIM AND AS A RESULT
OF THE WOUNDS SUSTAINED,HE BECAME SICK AND LATTER DIED AFTER TWO DAYS. AFTER
HIS DEATH, MY MOTHER AND I TOGETHER WITH MY YOUNGER BROTHER DECIDED TO MOVE
OUT OF ZIMBABWE FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR LIVES IN SOUTH AFRICA, WHERE I LATER
MOVE TO EUROPE.

BUT BEFORE MY FATHER DIED, HE WROTE A WILL, WHICH READS. MY BELOVED SON, I
WISH TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE SUM OF (US$15.5 MILLION DOLLARS) WHICH I
DEPOSITED WITH A COURIER COMPANY IN EUROPE IN CASE I WANT TO INVEST THE MONEY,
HE DEPOSITED THE MONEY IN A COURIER COMPANY WITH MY NAME (JOHNSON NDIOVU) AND
IT CAN BE CLAIM BY ME ALONE WITH THE DEPOSIT CODE, ALL THE DOCUMENT COVERING
THIS MONEY IS WITH ME. I WANT TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY MOTHER AND BROTHER.

FROM THE ABOVE REASONS, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT THE LIVES OF MY FAMILY DEPEND
ON THIS MONEY. AS SUCH, I WILL BE VERY GRATEFUL IF YOU CAN ASSIST US, I AM NOW
LIVING IN EUROPE AS POLITICAL ASYLUM AND THE FINANCIAL LAWS OF EUROPEANS DO
NOT ALLOW ASYLUM SEEKERS A CERTAIN FINANCIAL RIGHTS TO SUCH HUGE AMOUNT OF
MONEY.

IN VIEW OF THIS, I CANNOT INVEST THIS MONEY ALL ALONE HENCE I AM SEEKING FOR
YOUR ASSISTANCE TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY OUT OF COURIER COMPANY FOR INVESTMENT
PURPOSE. FOR YOUR EFFORTS, I AM PREPARED TO OFFER YOU 15% OF THE TOTAL FUNDS,
5% FOR ANY EXPENSES THAT MAY BE INCURRED IN THE COURSE OF THIS TRANSACTION,
60% WILL BE KEPT FOR THE INVESTMENT WHILE REMAINING 20% WILL BE KEPT FOR MY
FAMILY AND I PERSONAL USE.

FINALLY, THE MODALITIES ON HOW THE TRANSFER WILL BE DONE WILL CONVEYED TO YOU
ONCE WE ESTABLISH TRUST AND CONFIDENCE BETWEEN OURSELVES. LOOKING FORWARD TO
YOUR URGENT REPLY. FOR MORE INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT ME ON THIS ALTERNATIVE
E-MAIL ADDRESS:- jsdvu91z@netscape.net

NOTE. THE KEY WORD TO THIS TRANSACTION IS ABSOLUTE CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECRECY
AND YOUR URGENT RESPONSE WILL BE HIGHLY APPRECIATED.

THANKS AND GOD BLESS,

JOHNSON NDIOVU

(For the Family).
