Attn: My Dear Friend,

Compliments, I Mr.Chris Adamu have decided to bestow this
trust on you, which I pray you will not ignore or betray. I
appologise in advance for any inconviniences this may cause
you. I am Mr.Chris Adamu  the Personal Attorney to late Mr.
PATRICK CARL , who was a contractor here in Lagos, Nigeria.
 And on the the 21st of April 2002; my client, and his
family were perished in a ghostly car accident along Oshodi
Badagary express way Lagos. As a matter of fact, my client
made a fixed dopsit Amount, valued at (USD$12.5M) with one
of the banks in Nigeria. and upon the maturity time of
their agreement, his bank started contacting him but no
response. Conseqently,
the bank issued me a notice to provide the next of kin to
the deceased as his personal attorney, or have his account
confiscated after four years, as it is in the law of this
country.

Since then, I have made several contacts to His Countries
Embassy in order to locate any of my clients extended
relatives, which had also been unsuccessful. Since I have
been unsuccesfull in locating the relatives for over two
years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next
of kin of the deceased since none of his relatives were no
way to be found so that the proceeds of this account valued
at $12.5m could be transffered into your account,
thereafter, we will both share it in percentage according
to our contributions to boost the success of this great
transaction. I have all the necessary legal documents that
can be used to back up all the claims we will make. I know
that you might be wonder why I have decided to trust you
with this huge sum, but the truth is that I need you to get
this money out and considering the fact that you are a
foreigner which makes it a lot easier and straight forward.

All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us make
this great benefiting transaction successfully. I guarantee
you that this will be executed under a legitimate
arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the
law. Please get in touch with me as fast as possible
through my E-mail  to enable us discuss further the
progress of this business. alternatively you can reply
through this email chrisadamu77@netexecutive.com
With best regards,

Chris Adamu
