Update!  Jeff the DUI guy wants to party, so no go on the driving.  Like I guessed, Nat and Lorena are going to pass on the limo.  So, taxi is probably the best bet.  We're meeting at Nat's place in the early evening to "get ready" and then planning to hit the bars and maybe a couple of parties.  Are you going to join us?   Do you know of anything going on?
