Wednesday February 23, 12:01 pm ET<br>
<br>
RENO, Nev., Feb. 23, 2005 PRIMEZONE. Martin Nutraceuticals Inc. (MTNU)<br>
is a company focused on developing natural and alternative medicine<br>
products that provide better health for individuals through the use of<br>
their wide range of products, which aid in joint therapy, digestive<br>
therapy, WeightControl, blood circulation and alertness, and overall improved<br>
functioning of the b0dy.<br>
<br>
The flagship product which is based on Joint Therapy is used to aid in<br>
joint and general arthritic pain. Over 65 million Americans suffer from<br>
arthritis and osteoporosis. For several years, Dr. A. W. Martin DC,<br>
PhD, RNCP, DNM, a world renowned researcher has studied the effects of<br>
enzyme therapy on pain and inflammation. Dr. Martin has developed a unique<br>
blend of proprietary and patented ``systemic oral enzymes'' designed to<br>
provide superior anti-inflammatory benefits. Studies have shown that<br>
Dr. Martin's Joint Therapy, proprietary enzyme formula reduces pain and<br>
inflammation in 80% of patients who are diagnosed with Osteoarthritis of<br>
the knees in less than 6-weeks.<br>
<br>
In another study conducted the patient Fibromyalgia -- a severe muscle<br>
pain syndrome that affects more than 20 million North Americans -- 90%<br>
of patients reported relief from swelling and pain within 4-weeks of<br>
using Dr. Martin's Joint Therapy formula.<br>
<br>
The nutraceuticals market has grown steadily at an incredible rate of<br>
15-20% annually since 1998. Currently in North America, over 3.9 billion<br>
is spent on over-the-counter and prescription medication for arthritis,<br>
joint and muscle related pain alone. Since Dr. Martin's foray into the<br>
nutraceuticals market, Dr. Martin's products have amassed sales over 35<br>
million. It is with this track record and knowledge that Martin<br>
Nutraceuticals has re-branded many of Dr. Martin's successful formulas and is<br>
poised to unveil them onto an international platform.<br>
<br>
In the weeks and months to come, the company will be unveiling new<br>
product lines, various sales targets, contracts, distribution agreements<br>
and clinical data.<br>
<br>
About MTNU:<br>
<br>
MTNU is becoming quickly recognized in the nutraceutical marketplace<br>
which will surpass 74.4 billion in the year 2007. With a growing demand<br>
for nutraceutical products that provide not only health benefits, but<br>
also prevent and provide treatment for disease, MTNU provides high<br>
quality products that use proprietary and patented oral systemic enzymes<br>
that help in the rapid absorption of the product, resulting in incredibly<br>
swift, and effective results to symptoms including:<br>
<br>
JointPain<br>
Cardiovascular Irregularities<br>
Digestive Irregularities<br>
Anti-Oxidization<br>
WeightL0ss<br>
<br>
MTNU offers individuals a wide array of reliable and effective<br>
nutraceuticals. Martin Nutraceuticals has created a family of complimentary<br>
medicine and supplementation that has helped thousands of people suffering<br>
from arthritis and general jointpain, poor circulation, tiredness,<br>
obesity and digestive complications. By integrating proprietary oral<br>
systemic enzymes, MTNU has revolutionized the consumption of naturopathic<br>
supplementation. With the use of these enzymes with products such as<br>
Joint Therapy, MTNU has designed an innovative way to treat arthritis and<br>
general jointpain.<br>
<br>
Millions of people in North America suffer from some degree of general<br>
jointpain. According to the Arthritis Society, arthritis is North<br>
America's most common ailment, with over 44 million North Americans<br>
suffering. The Wall Street Journal, in the April 19th, 1999 issue states that<br>
Aspirin, Ibuprofen (Cox 1) Vioxx, Celebrex (Cox 2) killed 20,000<br>
Americans a year and put another 100,000 in the hospital suffering with drug<br>
side effects including: liver damage, kidney damage and intestinal<br>
hemorrhaging. With many of these products being pulled and highly<br>
regulated because of the potential of deadly side effects, sufferers of<br>
jointpain are seeking a natural, healthy alternative to aid in their<br>
suffering.<br>
<br>
MTNU has developed a proprietary therapeutic product, Joint Therapy,<br>
which is able to benefit all types of arthritis from: Rheumatoid<br>
Arthritis, sports injuries, pelvic inflammation to cardiac inflammation. MTNU's<br>
unique marketing program consists of heavily aired infomercials, direct<br>
mailorder marketing and large pharmaceutical and retail chains.<br>
<br>
Will MTNU explode higher as more and more investors become aware of the<br>
stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait until it is too late.<br>
Remember, timing your trade is critical.<br>
<br>
Good Luck and Happy Trading.<br>
