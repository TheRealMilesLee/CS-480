In his email a few days ago dealing with the newly adopted WPTF principles for RTO formation, Gary Ackerman wrote that:

"Dan Douglass will utilize this document to review the WestConnect filing, and in combination with members' comments on the same, prepare a briefing to the Board in a special teleconference Board Meeting that we will hold on Wednesday morning, October 31 (Halloween) at 11 a.m."

So far, no members have sent me any of their comments on the filing.  It would be greatly appreciated should some of you do so before next week.  Thanks!

Subject: WPTF Principles for RTO Formation


Based on the amendments and comments made at yesterday's Board meeting, the following RTO principles are hereby adopted per yesterday's vote. 
  
  a.. The Western States should have a single RTO eventually, but initially there could be two entities (the California ISO and an RTO for the rest of the Region). FERC has a unique opportunity to mediate between RTO West and the newly formed WestConnect (the proposed successor agent for the now defunct Desert STAR) to form a single RTO for the non-California portion of the West. 
  b.. The RTO Governing Board should be truly independent, and be absent of any "stakeholders".  The Board should have at its disposal a meaningful stakeholder advisory committee for the purpose of airing technical issues, and identifying different viewpoints. The seats on the advisory committee should be equally split between load serving entities and suppliers 50/50. However, within each subgroup, there can be different representative classes as determined by the Board. 
  c.. The RTO should maintain separation of the operation of any energy market from the parties that own the transmission assets. 
  d.. The RTO should provide a real-time imbalance energy market, allow for self-provision of ancillary services, and operate a real-time market for each congestion zone within the RTO when transmission congestion is present. 
  e.. The RTO should provide demand response mechanisms in its Tariff, and the Tariff and Operating Procedures should either promote and enable retail competition, or not discourage retail competition. 
If you have any editorial comments or changes, please send them to me.  This is a working document. 
Dan Douglass will utilize this document to review the WestConnect filing, and in combination with members' comments on the same, prepare a briefing to the Board in a special teleconference Board Meeting that we will hold on Wednesday morning, October 31 (Halloween) at 11 a.m.
