Dear Dr.Kaminski:
 
It was really nice to talk to you tonight.   Tonight, my willingness to explore Enron's innovative culture became much  stronger.  To your question, "who will sell it?", my answer is "Enron will  sell it."  My current idea is to create  hedging portfolio against DRAM price movement and sell the insurance based on  the payoffs from the hedging portfolio.
 
FYI, I attach my resume.  Thank you very  much.
 
 
Best regards,
