<P>THE CHALLENGE is to devise some system, technology or protocol by which 
we can virtually eliminate the ability of potential hijackers to seize control 
of a commercial airliner by means of smuggled weapons.
<P>It's a tough nut to crack, as is demonstrated by the large number of people 
who think they know just the way to crack it. One idea is to arm the pilot.  
But opponents say this merely ensures that there will be a lethal weapon on 
the plane, ready to obey the law of unintended consequences in some tragic 
mishap.  And there are pilots who point out that if they wanted to be security 
guards, they wouldn't have frittered away years pursuing lucrative flying 
careers.
<P>Then there's the sky marshal proposal.  But who hires them?  The airlines, 
who have made it clear at the passenger gate that they consider anyone who 
will work for busboy's wages to be acceptable in a security position?  Bear in 
mind, we'll need thousands of them.  Do you genuinely believe that there are 
in this country thousands of unemployed people you would trust to be the only 
persons packing heat on airliners?
<P>Sealing off the pilot and co-pilot in the cockpit is an attractive option, 
if you're the pilot or co-pilot, but it's cold comfort for the passengers in 
the section of the plane with the hijackers.
<P>Some solutions rely on tomorrow-tech X-ray machines that can allegedly spot 
a needle in a haystack, or at least a penknife on a passenger.  Unfortunately, 
these machines cost only slightly less than a congressional seat, and require 
operators with far too much training and pride to work for what would be very 
respectable wages in Bolivia.
<P>There are other suggestions, but they are even more questionable, and not 
nearly as amusing.  There is, however, one solution which no one has put forth,
<P>but which is more foolproof than any measure short of actually anesthetizing 
all passengers and handcuffing them to their seats.  We merely institute one 
very simple rule:
<P>Everybody flies naked.
<P>If you want to ensure that people aren't surreptitiously boarding your 
plane with razor-sharp or finely-pointed objects designed to inflict physical 
harm, this is your short-form answer.  To any doubters, I say envision 
yourself naked.  Now try to think of some part of your body on or in which you 
would be willing to conceal a box-cutter.  My theory: Nobody is that fanatic.
<P>(Admittedly, there are a few people who have no qualms about putting things 
like that in places like those, but you almost never find them on airplanes, 
because they travel by rail or highway with the rest of the carnival.)
<P>This Air Naked gambit has other advantages in addition to its concealment 
slam-dunk.  Again, imagine yourself naked.  Now try to see yourself leaping to 
your feet and commanding the rest of the passengers, "I am taking control of 
this plane!  Defy me and you will regret it!"  First, you will feel like an 
idiot.  Second, you are unarmed, and the most vulnerable parts of your anatomy 
have never been more inviting, or accessible, targets.
<P>In fact, if you're of the same obsessively religious bent as most hijackers 
these days, it's likely that you could no more totally bare yourself and 
mingle with women in a similar state than you could mail your diary to the 
Mossad.  Boarding a clothing-prohibited aircraft would essentially be your 
Flight to Hell.  One person's fantasy is another's damnation.
<P>Speaking of which, some people will carp that Air Naked would financially 
hobble the airlines, repelling those travelers who consider viewing others, or 
being viewed by them, in the altogether to be offensive, embarrassing or 
immoral.  To them, two comments:
<P>First, it seems that the trip clearly wasn't all that necessary after all.
<P>Second, a vast host of Americans consider the Playboy Channel to be 
offensive, embarrassing, or immoral, but there isn't a major air carrier in 
the land that wouldn't love to have the channel's balance sheet.
<P>Don't think of this as a desperate measure.  Think of it as ingenious 
market rebuilding.
