Update:  Randy called, is still not feeling well (nothing will stay down), and his blood sugar is still out of kilter.  He plans to call in later today.  If anyone takes any calls or any questions occur, call him at home.  Thanks.

Randy called in early (sorry for the delay) -- he's not feeling well, blood sugar is high, hopes to be in the office later this morning.
