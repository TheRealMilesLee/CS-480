WEDNESDAY
 
OCTOBER 24th
STATIC @ HYPERIA
 
DnB Massive Weekly 
* 1.50 Drinks and Domestics till midnight      
18 + 

A full evening of : Drum n Bass, Reggae, HipHop, Garage, Breaks, and Beats set the tone all night in the two rooms.  
Big ups to sessions from locals like Realtyme, BMC, Ryno, SDF:One, Audio 3 w/ MC Swift, Bruno B, DeFrag, Stealth, DJ Azreal, the 713tekno massive and others who regularly hit the decks on this night.   

We all know how this works. Drum and Bass is an acquired taste for many. But, once you get the "message" of this genre of music, once you feel its rhythms to the point of understanding, it's "soul", so to speak, you become hooked. Occasionally, if you spend many nights at the DnB events or Static, or hang out with generous people who are ready and willing to share with you their groove, you eventually find your dancing style and that is when you really feel like you belong.
