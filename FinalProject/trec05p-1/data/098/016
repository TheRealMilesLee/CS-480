Gerald!

Here is another Bridgeline outgoing guaranty that we would like to have reviewed and executed.   The amount of the guaranty should be $1.00MM.  I will be happy if you can kindly give me a call, I have a few minor questions on some of the comments.



Thanks

Attached is the Guaranty that has been review by our legal department with
the changes that they requested.

Trevor  I also ran across a few contracts in  the name of Bridgeline Gas
Distribution. There hasn't been any activity on these contracts over the
past year. Should we take Bridgeline Gas Distribution off of the approve
bidders list? If not we will need it listed on the guaranty as well.

Thanks
