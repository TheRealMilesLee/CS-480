Please look at the attached.  If there are some things missing, please let me know.  If some things on the list are not applicable, please note that too. Just send your deletions/additions to me via email.  If you can get this to me by the end of the day Wednesday, that would allow us to proceed with Questar all the sooner.

Thanks,

Mark
