Paul, we can give you $.04 into Kern or $.06 into WIC, but you'll need to
pick one or the other.  This is for November only.  Let me know.

Thanks!

We have told Enron we would give them 4MMcf/d of OTTCO transport to Kern
for November for the extra Petrogulf gas.  This will be in addition to the
10 MMcf/d allocated to Ultra gas.  I have heard the dehy bypass should be
done before this.  If not, we will have to send additional raw Jonah gas
around the JT to meet the 14 MMcf/d nomination.

Sherry, we're going to have to bump up their allocation to more like
4mmcf/d.  let's discuss this morning.

Marc, perhaps we can let them nom this at OTTCO?  Enron has been wanting to
do a deal here.  It may already be too late since bid week is well
underway.
