No.  No.  No.  We do not want to tell MSN until after they are formally served.  To bolster our venue argument, we want to make sure they don't have chance to file a lawsuit before they are served. We can call them literally one minute after formal service has been accomplished.

We need to call them and tell them we did it.  Who should do that?

	The lawsuit was filed at 11:06 a.m.  The next thing to do is to get MSN formally served.  To do that, we have to get citation issued (we are working with the court personnel to expedite this process) and serve the papers on MSN's registered agent in Austin.  We are trying to do that as quickly as possible  -- hopefully, by the end of the day.  Please do not mention the lawsuit to MSN until I notify you that formal service has been accomplished.

	Also, as the day progresses and negotiations continue, please let me know if any commercial reason arises such that you believe service should be delayed.

	I will keep you updated.

	Andy
