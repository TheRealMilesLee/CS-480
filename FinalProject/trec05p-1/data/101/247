Steve, FYI, Lorraine is having her procedure to have intravenous (sp?) antibiotics installed for her sinus problems.  She anticipates being out of the office the week of 11/5 to recover.

Kim - I have scheduled my surgery for Monday, 11/5.  In preparation, I must have pre-op and a meeting with my doctor on Thursday, 11/1.  I will be leaving the office around 11 am on 11/1.
