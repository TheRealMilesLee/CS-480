Everyone,

Please mark your calendar for November 29th, from 6-9:00 pm.  We will be participating in the Rice MBA Corporate Partners Reception.  

As you may already know, the main objective of the Corporate Partners Reception is to bring employers and students together - even before they are admitted to the Rice MBA program.  Enron has always participated in this event, and we would hope that each of you will be able to attend this year.

The event will be held at the El Paso Energy Corporation Building, on the second floor.  Each company participating at the reception will provide a speaker to make a brief presentation introducing the company to all attending students.  Following the speakers, company representatives and students will have the chance to meet and talk during the reception.

I will send you more information about the event as the date nears, but please go ahead and mark your calendars!

Thank you,

Julie Davidson
