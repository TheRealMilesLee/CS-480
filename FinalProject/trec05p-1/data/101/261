Just a quick update on the NC Multi-pollutant legislation and NY CO2 legislative efforts that seemed to moving ahead a couple of months ago.

NY CO2 legislation - AB 5577-B passed the Assembly (almost unanimously) in June.  It was referred to the Senate and it does not have a sponsor there so nothing is happening.  It is not likely to be voted on this year.  My source was unsure as to why no one in the Senate had picked up the bill.

NC multi-pollutant legislation - In NC Bill 1078 is also awaiting a vote. Affected power companies Duke and North Carolina Power and Light support the bill, however industrial companies (mostly Dupont and Weyerhauser) oppose the bill due to concerns about electricity price impacts and have effectively prevented it from being voted on. There are only 1-2 weeks remaining before the legislature is dismissed. Supporters of the bill are still hopeful, but the outcome is unclear.

We will keep you posted as any new developments occur.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
