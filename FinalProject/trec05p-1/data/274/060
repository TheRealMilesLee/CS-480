Automated Procedure Development for Regulatory Compliance ( OSHA - PSM / DOT / Sarbanes - Oxley )
By Pro-Tech Soluitons, Inc.

 - No software purchase necessary; Let us run 'ProcessWriter' for you at our hourly rate 
 - Standardize procedure development and delivery across multiple facilities 
 - Build file folders for procedures automatically based on YOUR key processes 
 - Build procedures automatically based on YOUR key process lists using YOUR document templates 
 - Build accurate content using YOUR standard phrases and YOUR formalized data 
 - Procedures can be automatically developed for all types of equipment-based or office-based processes 

'ProcessWriter', built in Microsoft Word, can be used it to automate the procedure development process for your locations.

The first part of the ProcessWriter program is called 'BuildTree'. It builds folder structures and procedure files from templates at run-time. Folder and file names are created automatically. The file folder tree and all related procedure files are built with a single button click.

With the procedures built, filed, and partially populated, the 'FindIt / PlaceIt' part of the ProcessWriter program is used to quickly add content.  The program allows the authoring of procedure documents with minimal typing, no typographical errors and no document formatting errors.  Use unlimited standard phrases controlled by the writer or the Company, based on the extent of standardization required, and are easily amended.

Simple Example: The cost to run 'ProcessWriter' for a natural gas compressor station containing reciprocating compressors, separation vessels, tanks and metering equipment is usually less than $1,000.  Using your facility drawings, information is developed, including procedures, consequence of deviation files and facility equipment lists, which can then be e-mailed to you or provided on a CD.  Your Subject Matter Experts would then add further detail to meet corporate specifications and applicable regulations.  We can also provide consulting services to complete the procedure development process or train your subject matter experts to do the job.
