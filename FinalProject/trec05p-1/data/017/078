I will tell him what I know, although I haven't looked at a food processor in some time.  

Matt - I would suggest you talk to Matt Gravelle from ConAgra.  I have done him some favors over the years.  They are a big food processor with Beatrice Hunt Wesson.  He will know all the big tomato processors which are 80% of the food processing load.  Others include Tri-Valley.  I would try to get as many names and phone numbers as you can and call them up and ask them their plans.  My bet is cooler and wetter weather will result in a lower and later harvest and hence gas usage.  
The fruit driers are the other 20% and they are much less concentrated and it will be hard to get a handle on their usage.

Also, what's up with EES?  Do they have any marketers anymore?  Dan Bergmann used to be very effective in getting deals done with the food processors, but they laid him off.

I would like to have Matt Smith, West Fundamentals, call you to discuss the food processing load in CA.  He wants to pick your brain on how to gather more information on this business sector.

Thanks,
Mike
