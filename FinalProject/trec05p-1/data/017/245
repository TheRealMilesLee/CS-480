Notification of Operating Procedure Update

*	The following new or revised ISO Operating Procedures have been
implemented and are posted for reference on the ISO Website.

ISO Operating Procedure Updated:  T-116 AC/DC Nomogram with attachment A
			Please Note: Attachment B is NOT Posted for Security
Reasons
Version: 4.1
Effective Date: 8-1-2001
Procedure Purpose: The purpose of the COI/NW-Sierra and PDCI north-to-south
operating Nomogram (AC/DC Nomogram) is to operate in conformance with the
WSCC Minimum Operating Reliability Criteria (MORC) and to protect the WSCC
system during heavy export conditions from the Northwest to the Southwest
from disturbances similar to those that occurred on July 2 and August 10,
1996.  The Nomograms are based on the loss of the Bipolar PDCI, a 2-unit
loss at Palo Verde, a 2-unit loss of Moss Landing, or a Table Mountain South
Double Line Outage.  The Nomograms are limited by post-transient Outages.
Summary of changes: The WSCC stability limit changed from 10 to 20 minutes.

*	Please find them at
http://www1.caiso.com/thegrid/operations/opsdoc/index.html under the
appropriate Operating Procedure section heading.

If you have any questions, please e-mail the 'Procedure Control Desk'
