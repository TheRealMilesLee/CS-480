McKay,

I have reserved Buchanan's for Thursday, Aug 16. I need to contact some marketers to tell them about the outing. There will be some food/drinks and a very short	
introduction of the FX products. Please provide contacts for the following firms:

Duke
Mirant
Transcanada
Aquila - Canada
Dynegy
Reliant
Sempra
Engage Energy Canada
Utilicorp

and any other marketer you think will be interested. Would like to start calling tomorrow. 

Thx,

Stuart
