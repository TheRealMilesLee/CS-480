<P>dear Sir/madam<BR>I am making this contact hoping that you will
be<BR>willing and capable of handling this proposal. I am<BR>ASEBO ROBINSON
an account officer with a private firm<BR>here in South Africa.<BR>My
company handles consultancy and seismographic jobs<BR>for oil companies
including Total South Africa (Pty)<BR>Ltd, BP Southern Africa (Pty)
Ltd,Caltex Oil (SA)<BR>(Pty) Ltd,Engen Petroleum Ltd,Shell South Africa
(Pty)Ltd.<BR>The owner of this company is Mr. Manuel Lim, an
Asian<BR>engineer (MALAYSIA) who lived and did business in<BR>South Africa
for over thirty years before his<BR>unfortunate death on the 19 October
2004; on flight<BR>American Connection (Corporate Airlines) BAe
Jetstream32<BR>&nbsp; After his death, we the staffs of his company
made<BR>efforts to trace his family without success as<BR>unfortunately he
had no known wife or child.<BR>&nbsp;The embassy was contacted to trace them
but to no<BR>avail. The insurance company that Corporate Airlines<BR>company
contacted to pay compensation to the victims<BR>had the same problem so they
had to pay the<BR>compensation to our company.<BR>&nbsp;As the accounts
officer of this company, I was<BR>opportune to have helped in his financial
transaction<BR>with his bank.<BR>At the time of his demise, he had an excess
of Twelve<BR>Million Five Hundred thousand United State Dollars<BR>(12.5M)
in his personal deposit with African<BR>Development Bank Group
{ADBG}.<BR>&nbsp;The Bank has written several times on this issue but<BR>I
told them to wait that the next of kin of Mr. Lim<BR>next of kin is overseas
and will contact them.<BR>Presently, our company is about to fold because
the<BR>money paid by the insurance company of Corporate<BR>Airlines has been
exhausted in paying salaries and<BR>other expenses. I want you to assist us
by presenting<BR>yourself as the next of kin of Mr. Manuel Lim so
that<BR>the money deposited by Mr. Manuel Lim in African<BR>Development Bank
can be paid into your account as the<BR>next of kin to the
deceased.<BR>&nbsp;As soon as the money is confirmed credited into
your<BR>designated account through my perfected plans, I will<BR>come over
to your country for a potential business<BR>venture as I am planning to
invest part of the money<BR>into real estate business.<BR>&nbsp;If you are
interested in this transaction and sure<BR>that you cannot betray me in this
regards, contact me<BR>via this email:(<A
href="mailto:robinson080@africamail.com">robinson080@africamail.com</A>)<BR>Thanks<BR>Yours
Sincerely,<BR>Mr Asebo Robinson</P>
