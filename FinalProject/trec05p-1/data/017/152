Thanks for the update.  Let's hope Citizens sticks with you guys for the full term.  Jeff Hodge told me yesterday that he has requested some changes in the ENA/EAMR contract from Lou, but that Lou hasn't called back.  I will assume that you will follow up on that contract and make sure it gets done.  With respect to the monthly fee, I am assuming you will be sending ENA an invoice each month.  Kim Ward at 713/853-0685 will be your contact person if the invoice isn't paid and she will coordinate with our settlements group until we get into a monthly routine.

Let me know if there are any other issues.

Chris

Lou, Chris and Jeff,
The services agreement between EAMR and Citizens for gas control and transaction management services is now executed.  
Yesterday afternoon, Citizens faxed the execution pages back to us.  EAMR's original of the agreement is expected in the mail shortly.
Full service under the agreement is beginning today.
Last week EAMR put the total insurance package in place that finally satisfied Citizens' requirements.
