Yes it is related to ECS.  The company is RHC Enterprise (Rob Christian).  Although we don't know that the entire $1MM relates to us.

What is the second hand info on the $1MM lien?  Is it related to ECS?

EPSC advised that we have received notice that an $83,210 lien will be filed by Fisk Electric against MFN for work relating to ECS.

Further, we have second hand information inside our team that indicates a second company may file a $1MM lien against MFN.

It is imperative that we resolve this issue.  Building financing cannot be closed with any liens outstanding.

Because we have benefited from Fisk's and any other contractors efforts in ECS contracted for by MFN; should MFN fail to resolve liens against them we will be required to clear the liens on their behalf in order to obtain financing.



While the second lien is hearsay at this point, we should reassess our risk analysis regarding our strategy of relying solely on MFN.

I have recommended to Hasan and Pete that we run an D&B and a credit check.  These services can be obtained through GSS.  I can coordinate if needed.
