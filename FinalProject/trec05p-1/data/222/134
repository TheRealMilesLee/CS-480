Hi Bill,
First let me explain that the sealer that was applied to your grout
simply
provides stain resistance.  That's it.  It does nothing to the strength
of
the grout and does not in any way prevent cracks in the grout.  The
cracks
are probably caused by settling.  If the cracks are in the wall seams
(where
the walls meet each other) this joint should be caulked with an
appropriate
caulking.  If your shower grout is a non-sanded type, a non sanded
silicone
should be used.  If your grout is a sanded type, a sanded siliconized
acrylic caulking that matches your grout color should be used.
Resealing
the shower grout can be done according to the directions of the sealer
manufacturer.  Some silicone based sealer will last 3 to 6 months in a
shower environment.  Expensive solvent based sealers may last up to 10
years.
If the cracks are between the tiles in the walls and not just in the
wall
seams then the grout should be repaired.  Don't caulk these joints or
any
joints on or near the floor.  If these areas stay damp, mildew will
usually
be a problem without good ventilation.  It would be difficult for me to
describe how to do the repair without actually seeing it (digital
camera?)
so I'll suggest you take a class at The Home Depot on how to grout tile.
Hope that helps Bill.

Subject: Shower Tile


I have had my shower tiled recently.  The grout was sealed (in place for
about 4 months now. I have noted a few minor hair line cracks in the
corners
of my shower in between a few of the tiles.  My question is how do I 1.)
repair the cracks, 2.) when should I reseal (how often).

Thanks for your help.  Please respond to bwilliamsjr4@attbi.com

I appreciate your web site.

Sincerely

Bill Williams
