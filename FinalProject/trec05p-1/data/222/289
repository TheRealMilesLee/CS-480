OK

Who is the individual responsible for making sure that 600 plus people will read the 9 pages of protocol and will also verify and collect a signed certification from every new UBS employee by this Friday?  Who will collect Enron's copy of these and hold them and is someone coordinating with UBS directly?

Under the terms of the various agreements among certain Enron entities and UBS AG, certain Enron data and documents may be provided to UBS.  To ensure compliance with those agreements, Enron's document retention policy, as well as directives of various investigative agencies, the attached protocol regarding the process for migration of any information or data to UBS has been developed.

Please review the protocol carefully.  Then, complete the attached Certification and return it, with attachments, to Linda Guinn at EB 3829a no later than February 11, 2002.

Questions about this matter may be directed to Michelle Cash at (713) 853-6401 or Francisco Pinto-Leite at (713) 345-7942 .
