I spoke with Paige Cox and she will have a box setup at your location, when it arrives let me know and we will verify that stack and options manager are configured correctly.

I don't know if Bob hillier talked to you yet, but I need Stack and Option manager set up on a stand alone machine. I am moving to the power options group as of tomorrow.

My cell is 713 419 0203. Call with questions.
