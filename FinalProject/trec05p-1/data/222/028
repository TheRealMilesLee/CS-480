um excuse me sir, but i think that you stood me up twice and you never call me back.  so i just decided to stop being part of your enterage.  wade and i are trying to work through things, but i guess that we are getting along a little better.  we have one more hole in our wall and i haven't broken any phones lately so i guess that is a good sign.  we still have a long way to go.  so why haven't i heard from you little one?

nope.  i am in the old building on the 32nd floor.  i think that is where we all used to be.  it is depressing over here.  and we are actually having to work.  i miss being over there.  so, why don't you talk to me anymore?
