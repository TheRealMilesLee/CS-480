Hi sweetheart.

I love you.

I enjoyed sitting at the table eating breakfast with you this morning. Every day that I get to be with you is a special gift for me. I love you so much. 

Jorie sent an envelope with Dan for me to give to you. It says on the envelope that she looked for the house online (ERA.COM) and found it under the 150-250 range. 

I can't wait to see you tonight. I love you baby.

Have a good day.

CV.
