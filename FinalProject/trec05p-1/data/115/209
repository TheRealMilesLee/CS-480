John/Louise

Attached is the final spreadsheet outlining hires/no hires.     Currently we have 15 selected for hire.       However the two with questions were discussed as good hires and perhaps should be looked at again (both external candidates - Tom Martin's group).

I will circle around with you today to discuss further - so we can proceed with offers with your approval.

Thanks, Karen.


Ps - our external candidates did very well.
