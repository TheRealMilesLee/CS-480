Bill,

It is my understanding that you are handling netting agreements for Enron.
Thus, please find the attached agreements for each entity we represent and
review them.  As soon as you have had the opportunity to look them over,
contact me and we will work together to execute them.  I know that having
such agreements in place is a priority for both organizations.  Also, if
there is another contact person that I should be in touch with, please let
me know that, as well.  If you have any further questions, feel free to
contact me.

Thanks so much!!

Casi
