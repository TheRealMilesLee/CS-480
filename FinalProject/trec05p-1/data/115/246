As you know, Sarah is on her honeymoon now, so I am trying to tie up all loose ends with regard to the FMLA and Sick Leave Policy.  I would appreciate it if you would read the following documents and let me know if we have the "go ahead" to proceed.  We are beginning to work on a very tight deadline here since we need to give the appropriate notice to all employees.  
 
After reading the FMLA policy, do you think that we need to have links that explain ADA and Workers Comp?
 
If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to let me know.
 
Thanks,
Anne Labbe'
