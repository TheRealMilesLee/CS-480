Good morning ladies,
Just wanted to ensure that this current discussion with Bevin is resolving
the Performance Bond issue which you had mentioned to me - If so I can step
out and leave you in Bevin's good hands.  For my own information - because I
haven't dealt with these details before - is a Performance Bond needed in
addition to this agreement?

Lorraine,

Thanks for your suggestion in looking for it internally here.  It's a hit
and miss when it comes to getting anything from Chad since he's always on
the road.  Attached is what he sent.  I just figured it would be easier to
get a TW Ft agreement from TW.  I assumed wrong.

Hopefully, we can get the credit issues resolved.

Bevin
