Hello Greg,

My name is Barbara and I work here at NetAcumen. We are in the clickstream analysis space. I wanted to see if I can get on your radar to have an initial discussion regarding how we can help deliver the most complete picture of who your web visitors are and how they interact with your company.

Where we are significantly different from our competitors (webtrends, Accrue, NetGenesis) is we have the tools to integrate lots of disparate datasources together. We have the ETL Extraction Transformation and Load tools which allows us to integrate web log data with other valuable internal and external content, as well historical data about prior transactions, and more.

We have found that the typical log parsing solutions are black box solutions and require you change your website to conform to the parsing engine rather than the parsing approach conforming to your web site.  We see lots of companies have problems where their web site may have dynamic content served up.  NetAcumen quickly handles any type of customization required in parsing log files and dynamic content and more.

We provide our service as a asp or a onsite delivery.

If there is interest I would love to show you a demonstration of how easy this is for us.


We offer weekly web demonstrations, to sign up click on the url below
