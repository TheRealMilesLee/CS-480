   Word of the Day for Thursday March 14, 2002:

   raconteur \rack-on-TUR\, noun:
   One who excels in telling stories and anecdotes.

     An  excellent  raconteur,  he had a varied stock of stories
     and enjoyed the joke just as much when it was on himself as
     he did when it was on some one else.
     --"Rockefeller  Wit  Endeared  Him  to Friends; He Relished
     Quip  by Will Rogers About Him," [1]New York Times, May 24,
     1937

     Korda's  tone  of  voice  is  affectionate  and urbane, his
     manner  that of the accomplished raconteur who never spoils
     the story with a heavy-handed moral, relying for his effect
     on the telling anecdote and the apt phrase.
     --Lewis Lapham, "Adventures in the Book Trade," [2]New York
     Times, May 23, 1999

     He  has  an  excellent raconteur's mind, memory, vocabulary
     and  tongue,  brings  in a story just at the right time, in
     the  right  manner,  serves  his anecdotes perfectly either
     piping hot or ice-cold as tragedies.
     --Anatole Pohorilenko and James Crump, When We Were Three
     _________________________________________________________

   Raconteur  is from French, from raconter, "to relate, to tell,
   to  narrate,"  from  Old French, from re- + aconter, "to count
   up, to reckon."
