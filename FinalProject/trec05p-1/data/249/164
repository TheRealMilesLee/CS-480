It is very important that we check our order sheets after each nom cycle against what is actually flowing at our receipt and delivery points. If there are points flowing without an order or not flowing with an order, find out what the reason is, and don't believe what the plant guy says. Check with the scheduler, they are here until after 10 pm each night. Report problems to Gary or myself. We have had some situations recently where gas flowed for several shifts without an order, and that is tough to explain in our meetings with Marketing. Check flows and orders frequently. thanks. sj
