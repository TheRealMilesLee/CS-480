MR. TANG.K.LETIAN
International Commercial Bank

Taipei 104 Taipei Taiwan
 ATTENTION:
 
I am Mr.Tang Karl Letian,Presently Bank Manager of International commercial Bank China,100 Chi Lin Rd.,Taipei 104 Taipei Taiwan, R.O.C.
 
 I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail.  I  contact you independently of our investigation and no one is informed  of this  communication. 
 I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I  believe would  be of interest to you. In 1999, the subject matter Tobey Seidman , informed us that she had a financial  portfolio of  Seven Million Four Hundred and fifty thousand  Dollars ($7,450,000.00), which she wished to have us turn over (invest) on her  behalf.  I was the officer assigned to her case; I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto manager of the newly formed  branch , especially given the volume of funds she wished to put into our  Bank.  We met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed.I  encouraged her to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. 
The  favored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments. 
Based on my advice, we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at  2 million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but she desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments.
 
Upon maturity, I sent a routine Notification to her forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, We sent a reminder and finally we discovered from her contract employers, Tobey Seidman died From an air crash on Egypt Air flight 990  from New York two months earlier. Pls. visit the website http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm 
http://www.zenpageweavers.com/malikahti/journal/flight.htm

On further investigation, I found out that She died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace her next of kin Was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Tobey Seidman did not declare any kin or relations in her entire official Documents, including 
her Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  According to Laws of Republic of China, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Chinese Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.
 
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to  stand in as the next of kin to Tobey Seidman  so that the fruits of This woman's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide Immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for 
drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world 
that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.  The disbursement of the funds will be subject to negotiation between us. 
 
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, Please reply immediately 
Upon your  response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant  documents that will help you understand the transaction.Awaiting your urgent reply via my private personal fax number and email address:
  
Thanks and regards.
T.K Letian.
