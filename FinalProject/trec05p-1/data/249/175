On behalf of the Show Management team, I would like to thank you again for
registering to attend ELECTRIC POWER 2002 next week in St. Louis, MO.  There
is quite a bit of buzz about this year's conference in light of some of the
recent developments within our industry.

Now, more than ever is the time to come together and meet face-to-face with
your peers, colleagues, customers and competition in order to forge new
relationships, hear the latest technological advancements within the
industry, interact with your peers, exchange ideas and solutions and keep up
with what your competitors are doing.


We just have a few notes and reminders for you before you get to the event.


	*	You have registered as a Conference Delegate for the event
and we trust the conference will meet all your expectations.  Our Conference
Program Committee has put together what they consider to be a super program
- we hope you will agree.
	*	The opening Plenary session - Leadership in the Global Power
Industry - Lessons Learned begins at 9:00am Tuesday.  Get there early to
avoid lines at Registration.  This was the most popular session last year!

to bring your confirmation.  Registration opens at Tuesday at 7:00am and
will be open on Monday until 6:00pm, if you get there early.
	*	As a Conference Delegate you are entitled to register to win
a $15,000 Harley-Davidson* motorcycle to be given away Thursday afternoon.
You must be present to win.  
	*	Your colleagues can still register online at
http://www.electricpowerexpo.com/Currentshow/reg.asp, as a Conference
Delegate (if your company has 5 or more delegates, you should upgrade to a
Corporate Plan and send up to 10 for the same price) or just to visit the
Exhibit Hall and nearly 500 exhibitors.  Online registration closes this
Thursday, so tell them to hurry up.
