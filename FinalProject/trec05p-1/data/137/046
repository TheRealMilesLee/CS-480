Hunter,

Thanks again for the Coffee.  I really enjoyed hearing your take on the industry and actually I really enjoyed your interview as well.  I love to debate - especially economic theory/politics - which made your interview amazing to me.  

Quick Question, I apologize for not having a pen when we grabbed coffee.  I'm having difficulty remembering the books you recommended.  Would you remind again?

Jason
