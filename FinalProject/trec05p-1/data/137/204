As related to ETS IT we would receive in summary:
	Enron Net Works:	$6,598,276
	ISC in support of SAP:	$5,964,000

The remainder of the note details the above summarized charges.

The allocation we would receive from  Enron Net Works for ETS is $6,598,276.  It is made up of three primary categories:

IT Infrastructure
	email
	internet support
	security
	EDI
	data center operations
	enterprise software licenses

Data Communications Support
	local area networks (LAN)
	wide area networks (WAN)

Voice Communications Support
	telephony

Three relevant areas of the $6,598,276 which are still being discussed are:
	depreciation charge of $1,593,976
	allocation for an enterprise portal for $94,660, we believe this project has been posponed indefinantly
	allocation for EnronOnline services of $416,575, we have had discussions regarding the allocation methodology which should put this allocation closer to 	$100,000


I have attached a spreadsheet that details the costs on an even more granular level.

 

If you would like me to complete a similar overview for EGS please let me know.

Thank you.
