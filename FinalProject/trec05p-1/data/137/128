Wendy:

I do not think you need a MAC if you have a tiered Threshold.  Please confirm so that we can prepare the ISDA accordingly.  Thanks

Please be advised the attached credit worksheet for AltaGas Services should be put on the High Priority List as their is a potential deal pending with Derek Davies in Calgary.  Please forward draft ISDA with credit terms to Derek Davies for further handling as soon as possible.  Call with questions or comments. 

Thanks
Wendy
