Danny,

Listed below are some statistics that we keep track of relative to our IDD business.  The growth of this business is attributable to the great mix and number of people that we have in the Storage group under Sue's direction.  We feel that a big reason for our success is the great team that we have built and we have gone to great lengths to insure that we have the right mix of people in the group.  This is why were so excited to see that Morgan was interested in coming back to the group.  Not only does this get our staffing back to the level that it needs to be, but Morgan has proven that he is highly effective in the group.  If the situation with Morgan doesn't work out then I feel the need to continue looking for the "right" person to replace Theresa.

This approach is also the approach for the Pricing and Structuring group under Jo's leadership (i.e. insuring the right mix and number of people).  We have been looking to replace Jeff Nielsen with the right person and feel that the security of our business requires another person on the Pricing Desk.

I wanted to bring both of these jobs to your attention given the staffing questions that we had today.
