Bill Fox is one of the senior most executives at Citi who has been working with a number of people at Enron (myself included) during the past several weeks.  If we do not here something by tomorrow, I will escalate it up the ENE chain.

Hilda Munoz has asked Bill Fox for a decision.  He apparently didn't focus on it for a couple of weeks - can't imagine what else he was doing.  I was told Friday that we would get an answer today.

It sounds like you are on top of this - This was brought up at Rod's staff meeting.  If there is anything I can do to help, just let me know.  Who is handling this for us now?

Thanks for the note.  I will be in tomorrow and hope to work directly with Citibank to get his rolling ASAP.

Thanks,

Bruce

Bruce,
The problem appears to be that the person who needed to approve this has been sleeping at Enron (just kidding but he has been here for several 24 hour periods over the last 2 weeks)  and wasn't getting back to the credit card people.  It has been elevated now and we should have an answer Monday.  I'm getting indications that it should be ok but I don't have a firm answer yet.

As you are aware, ETS has committed to implementation of the Citibank purchasing card program.  We requested 20 cards, 30 days ago to be used in a pilot program.  In talking to Citibank, we were advised the cards are being held pending a review of Enron's credit.  

We currently are using Wright Express MasterCard.  We have ceased implementation of EDI with Wright Express because of the transition to Citibank.  At this time, we are in a serious dilemma with a working program with very costly manual invoice processing costs and a new program with Citibank that is on hold.

If you have contacts with Citibank who could assist us in moving our program forward, I would appreciate your assistance.  If we are unable to proceed with Citibank, we will need to spend the money and time to enhance our association with Wright Express.

Please call either John Gillespie (713-646-6222) or me.

Your assistance is appreciated,
