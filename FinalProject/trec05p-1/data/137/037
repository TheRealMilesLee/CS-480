14:01 19Nov2001 RSF-INSIDE FERC: Midwest-Market 2: Lack of sellers forces high Enron bids - PGN311

Washington (Platts)--19Nov2001/301 pm EST/2001 GMT 

One trader said that she found arbitrage opportunities on some of the online platforms, capitalizing on a 5- to 6-ct differential between prices posted on EnronOnline and those on IntercontinentalExchange. She confirmed that few market players are willing to sell to Enron, which is forcing Enron to bid at a premium. 


Spot prices on ANR Pipeline in Oklahoma ranged from about $1.75/MMBtu early in the morning to about $2.36/MMBtu late, up from Friday's range of $1.38 to $1.58/MMBtu.
