Hi Stephanie,

Someone in Tana's office told me you are the contact person for new NDA's.  If you are not the person, could you please contact me at 5-4079?  Here is the email I sent Tana.  Please call with any questions.

Hi Tana.

Could you please forward a NDA for the possible sale of EnronOnline functionality to the following person?  The NDA would be similar to the one you did for Equiva and Louis Dreyfus.

The contact information is:

Mr. Roger Parks
JR Simplot Company
rwparks@simplot.com

Thank you.

Mike Bridges
