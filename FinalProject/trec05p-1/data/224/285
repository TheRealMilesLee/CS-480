We will continue to track the receipt of late charts until all are received.  At this time, it is difficult to determine if the problem is with incoming mail from the field, Houston mail or Enron mail delivery.

Will keep you posted as we proceed.

Don,

GMS began tracking late NNG charts for January's close at noon on February 5, 2002.  One-hundred and eighty eight charts were received after the noon deadline on February 5th.  No charts were received on February 6th and none received as of noon today.  Many charts are still outstanding.
