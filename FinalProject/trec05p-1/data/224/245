Lunch has been confirmed with Linda Wehring for tomorrow, Friday 11:45 under my name at Churrasco's (Shepherd & Westheimer location).

Linda asked if someone could pick her up as she does not drive to work anymore.  Linda can be reached at 713-287-1046.

I will meet you guys at the restaurant as I hope to take the afternoon off.
