Louis,
The dash looks good.  I made a few edits and have highlighted (in yellow 2 places) where you need to edit.  Please try to push this, with Chip's help, tomorrow.

Ed, here is the document which will be forwarded to Kay Mann for approval routing.

 << File: TerminationDASH.doc >> 

Joe Parks and I talked with Rick Miles at Entex this afternoon.  He agreed to all terms.  We are waiting for them to reply with final concurrence on the $2.05 price/dth for the storage inventory.  

I stated that the early termination is subject to bankruptcy court approval.  That didn't bother Rick too much.  He acknowledged that Entex commercial-side needed their attorney's sign-off as well (but didn't think there would be an issue).
