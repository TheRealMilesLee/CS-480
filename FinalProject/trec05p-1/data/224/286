	Thanks. Lynn

Mark

Attached is a summary of the Lonestar imbalance for 2001.

 

As per our earlier discussion,  I met with Dan Fancler to discuss the Lonestar oba proposal.  Dan and I would suggest that a ceiling be placed on the cummulative volume amount and that any volume over that ceiling be required to be cashed out at that month's index price.  This process would serve to limit TW's financial exposure related to the revaluation of volumetric imbalances.

This is what I'm planning on proposing to them this week.  Comments? Objections?  Possible to implement?

Let me know,

Mark
