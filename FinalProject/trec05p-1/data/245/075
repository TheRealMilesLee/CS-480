Michelle,

In reviewing the latest gas sale to WGR effective April 1, I found that the referenced downstream contract (CR 27608) that WGR would be using is not valid for April activity.  Dennis Lee confirmed that the contract is considered a Red Rock expansion request that may start in June.  Do you want me to contact WGR and have them change the contract that we hand-off to?  WGR has  contract 24042 set up for another gas sale effective April 1.  Let me know how you would like me to proceed.

Thanks,  Bert
