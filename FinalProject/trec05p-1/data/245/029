When you get here on Monday morning, come to the 5th floor reception of the new building.  If your badge is not there, then I will come and pick you up when you get here and bring you up.  Your badge will be ready Monday for sure, whether it be morning or afternoon I am not sure of.

Ina,
We can most likely have this by Monday morning and he can pick this up at the 5th floor reception. If he has any problems he can call me. Thanks!
