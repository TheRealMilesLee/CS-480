Dear Lori,

Just a quick question:  Shayne Newell here (working on the petition) had
the company name quoted to her (at a meeting regarding assets in the
company) as:

Enron Capital & Trade Resources Investment Corp.

Is there another entity out there with that name rather than Enron Capital
& Trade Resources International Corp.?

Thanks!
Jayne
