Attached please find the file with the revisions for WestPower.  Commercial headcount was reduced from 64 to 52.  The correct list for West Power fundies and structuring is included in the "West Power" tab along with the traders, originators,etc. 

Additional comments on the attached:

Grace Rodriguez was listed as West Power commercial admin; she should be HR admin.
Terry Donovan was listed in both West Power and East Power; he has been deleted from West Power.
Dale Furrow was listed in both East Power and West Power; he has been deleted from West Power.
Dave Fuller is listed in Gas Structuring; he is a manager in West Gas Orig.

There are two contract employees in the West which are not included on the list but are important people going forward:
- Sonny Seaton, West Power Fundies
- Mike Tully, West IT Support, reporting to Dave Steiner

Also, in East Power, Ben Jacoby and Fred Mitro are listed; however they believe that they are in workoutco (they don't expect to be part of Netco)
