I'm not absolutely sure either, but I think she is saying they can provide a package that:

1) Provides IT staff that will not leave, and can backfill any attrition we may see.
2) Provide Cash for us to use as we see fit (i.e. retention) using our existing Hardware assets as collateral.
3) Help with any future integration work with the potential NewCo buyers (apparantly she knows who they are and they use IBM also, and she has contacts there).
4) Use IBM's name to help in anyway that may make the venture more likely to succeed.

Hi Louise,

Just got off the phone with Gail. She wants to know if they can help by coming up with a guaranteed offering from IBM that would help any NewCo succeed by providing IT support/direction, saving money, monetizing assets, retaining key staff and lending the IBM name, etc, etc to the deal.

If you're interested you can either call me or call her directly.

Anything here?  I think that at one time prior to filing IBM was looking to buy or monetize or loan against all out hardware so we could get cash but I am not sure where that went.
