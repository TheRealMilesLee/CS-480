I am very positive and feel that God will guide me into the Hope and Future He has for my life.  I thank you all for your friendship and will always cherish the memories we have made together.  I pray that you all have a bright outlook on your future and that you would be assured of the hope and future that awaits each of you.  Each of you have made a great contribution to my life.  I love you all.  Thank you for everything, especially the opportunity to know and work with you.  I will keep in touch.  Feel free to contact me any time!
