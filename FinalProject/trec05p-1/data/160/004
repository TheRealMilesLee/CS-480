Ok, ok, you big nag!! Really, I'm sorry I didn't write back sooner; it was a really quick weekend and I wasn't online, then it's already been a really busy couple days at work... the quick weekend was b/c yes, I travel for work and with the #$%^ airline issues caused by the 11th, this week I left home at 1:00pm Sunday to catch a 3:30 flight to Philly, which is where I've been commuting to on a weekly basis for nearly a year. While i travel every week for work, I really like travelling for fun, too. Preferably out of the country--which I haven't done in awhile :-( 

As far as the no extremist thing; I did notice that you changed your little catch phrase--actually, I liked the no extremist a little better... probably b/c it seems like there are a lot of people out there that ARE extremists (which in my book probably contributes to their singledom).... I had one guy offer to help me throw my "evil time-wasting machine" out the window--referring to my tv, of course. Given that one of my future home projects is to refinish the basement so that the future big screen tv will have a nice home, I figured we wouldn't really hit it off... :-) 

As for the hiking, biking, etc: yes, I do those things, although not nearly as much as I'd like. Actually, I'm most disappointed in the little time I spent on the golf course this year.... 

As for skiing: Chari 10 b/c I love bumps. I blew my knee at Keystone and right now have NO plans to return there--ever, I hope, but that's probably unrealistic. I just got the final ok from the orthopedist last Friday to head up to the mtns and I was dying to go, but had plans on Sat and had to leave on Sun... Hoping to be up there this weekend. Hope everyone left me at least a little snow! 

Oh, and finally: the "tell you later" thing is just b/c I don't have any pets--unless you include the teddy bear that travels with me every week, or the metal sculpture dog that sits on my deck, looking longingly at the unused doggie door leading to my fenced yard... Someday there'll be a "real" dog out there.... 

Ok, while I haven't grown tired of your questions, it is now 12:45am EST and I started with meetings at 7:00 this morning, so I'm going to call it quits for the night. 

Hope I have responded sufficiently :-)))) just kidding.

Hi,

Received your email, thanks for writing me back. Don't worry I can deal with sarcasm, I just didn't want to include everything as a "turn on" or people would think something was wrong with me.
And as far as the "No Extremist" goes, I really was at a lost for a title and came up with that last minute. So, now that I've defended my bio, let me knit pick yours, just kidding. 

I'm betting that with "Travelling Chick" as your title you must either travel a lot for work or really enjoy traveling, or both. I travel a lot in my job, but it seems to come and go in spurts. Right now we are gearing down for the Holidays, as well as other reasons, and I don't have any trips planned. 

I read your profile, do you really do all those things; hiking, biking, etc?
When do you get your rest? Why Vail's chair 10, is that where you blew out your knee, and can you still ski? Tir! ed of all these questions? One more than I'll let you go. What pets do you currently have that you would have to disclose at a later date? 

Talk to you later!
Paul
