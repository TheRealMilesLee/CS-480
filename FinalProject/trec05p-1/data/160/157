Julianne, 

Please address Cooper's questions, or forward to the Calgary office.  He's responsible for his own CN tax & has had est CN withholdings from his paychecks (not hypo).

Thanks, 

Mike

Hi,

I'm responding to an email sent by Tim Callahan on Nov 30 regarding questions on tax equalization.  I also left a voice-message for you.  

I'm in the Calgary office and paid out of the U.S.  I've been operating under the assumption that i 
wouldn't get hit twice on income taxes as there is a "credit" between Canada and the U.S.  However, after doing some reasearch on the IRS website, it seems there may be a cap to the "credit" that is allowable.  Do you know anything about this? or can you point me to someone who might be knowledgeable in such matters?  

thanks,
Cooper Richey
