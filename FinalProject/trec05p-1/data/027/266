Here's the scoop as I know it as of 3;15 today.

2002 Commercial Plan mtg for McCarty, Thursday, August 16th
As of 8/14 @ 2:40, Danny advised that the meeting will proceed BUT, suggested that they break at 10:00 and attend the Enron All -Employee meeting and reconvene at 11:00 - 1:00. Note the lunch will be delivered at 11:30.
Tracy & John, can you arrange the Agenda accordingly and reminder that Eric Gadd will be leaving at 12:00 so his area should be covered before then.  Can we achieve the business goals with the break?  Is this ambitious?
If you want to extend the meeting time, I have extended the conference room (49C2) till 1:30.  The conference room is booked at 2:00 by Steve Harris/Drew Fossum but, I could ask them to adjust their meeting if more time is needed. Please advise.

Quarter Forecast Review w/ Stan, Wednesday, August 22nd 
CANCELED as per Tracy on 8/13

NNG/TW Actuals alias CBR meeting, Friday, September 14th at 1:30
A request from Deb/Dave's office to reschedule as Dave had conflict and can not attend. I followed up with Cindy on July 26th & 27th and Cindy suggested that Danny talk to Stan.  I reminded Danny to discuss with Stan at the July 30th staff meeting.  No discussion or resolution.
Note that a CBR update was completed on July 11th and as per Tracy, the information would be fairly current to update Stan.  A NB Strategy meeting was also completed on July 19th in Omaha.
8/14, as per Tracy, Stan referred back to Danny.  Danny suggested canceling and thought we had already done so.  I advised him that the Quarter Forecast Review w/ Stan was canceled but, not this particular meeting. CANCEL??  

3rd CE Review w/ Stan, Tuesday, September 18th
Confirmed on Danny's calendar
