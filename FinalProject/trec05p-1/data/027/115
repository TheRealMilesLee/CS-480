After the Day ahead market ran, the Path 15 branch group TTC in the (N-S)
direction was changed from 1275 MW to 1000 MW and the Path 26 branch group
TTC in both directions was changed from 3000 MW to 2800 MW for HE's 1100 and
1200 for operating day 8/14/01.  The reason(s) for the change is due to the
lines being de-energized for CB test.  The first applicable Hour Ahead
market to run with these values is HE 1100.  The ISO will update you of any
changes in line rating status.  Sent by Market Operations, inquiries please
call the Hour Ahead Desk.

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change.  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current,
accurate information available in preparing this notice, system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice.
