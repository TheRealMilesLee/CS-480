PARTICIPANTS:
Enclosed is your updated Account Activity Statement summarizing all accounts receivable/payables activities with CalPX occurring during 2001 starting with the issuance of the December Day-Ahead/Day-Of Market invoice back in January through the April Real Time invoices in August.
The April billing cycles are adjustments being made by CAISO that go back as far as Spring 2000.  CAISO is continuing to make these adjustments, which are basically meter corrections and approved scheduling coordinator disputes, for prior periods.  These will probably continue for a few more months because of the recent FERC ruling regarding refunds.
Please feel free to call Don Deach (626-685-9876), Rachel Axelrad (626-685-9843) or Clark Cheng (626-685-9846) with any questions.
Thank You.
