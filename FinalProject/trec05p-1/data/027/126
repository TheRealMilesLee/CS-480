SACRAMENTO - This evening, the Governor's Office of Emergency
Services has dispatched 11 new strike teams (55 engines) to fires
burning throughout Northern California.  This includes 35 local
government and State OES engines that were dispatched to the Emigrant

Gap fire on an 'immediate need.'  Additionally, State OES has
activated its Inland Region Emergency Operations Center and State
Operations Center in Sacramento to coordinate response to the
Northern California fires.
	
Each strike team consists of five fire engines - with three to four
firefighters per engine - and a strike team leader.  The latest
strike teams are being dispatched from the following locations.   

EMIGRANT GAP FIRE
1 OES Strike Team 

1 OES Satellite Communication Trailer

Stanislaus County (2)
San Joaquin County 
Nevada County

Throughout Northern California and Nevada, eight fires have burned
upwards of 100,000 acres so far.  In addition to the recent group of
11 strike teams, OES has also deployed 99 other State OES and local
government fire engines, two state-of-the-art OES satellite
communication trailers, and numerous fire and telecommunications
staff to the Northern California fire lines.  

The local and state-owned equipment has been dispatched through
California's Fire and Rescue 
Mutual Aid System, administered by OES, to assist the California
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and federal wildland fire

agencies, and local departments.  The system is designed to ensure
that additional resources are provided to local jurisdictions
whenever their own resources are committed or insufficient for a
specific fire.
