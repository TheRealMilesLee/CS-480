SACRAMENTO - The Governor's Office of Emergency Services dispatched
on an 'immediate need', four additional strike teams; totaling 20
local government engines, to the Emigrant Gap fire off Interstate 80.

 The fire is currently burning out of control, threatening structures

and has the potential of jumping 
I - 80.  

Of the four teams, two originate from Sacramento County, one from
Placer County, and one from Calaveras County

Throughout Northern California and Nevada, eight fires have burned an

estimated 92,000 acres so far.	In addition to the recent group of
four strike teams, OES has also deployed 79 other State OES and local

government fire engines, two state-of-the-art OES satellite
communication trailers, and numerous fire and telecommunications
staff to the Northern California fire lines.  

The local and state-owned equipment has been dispatched through
California's Fire and Rescue 
Mutual Aid System, administered by OES, to assist the California
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, U.S. Forest Service, and
local departments.  The system is designed to ensure that additional
resources are provided to local jurisdictions whenever their own
resources are committed or insufficient for a specific fire.

Among the 99 engines deployed, 20 are State-owned OES Engines.	These

engines have been provided to local departments by OES.  Under an
agreement with the state, when requested by OES, fire departments are

required to dispatch the engines, including personnel, within an hour

to the scene of an emergency or disaster in California.

When not in use during a disaster, local departments may use the
engines for mutual aid response for neighboring cities and counties,
local multiple alarm fires, temporary replacement of out-of-service
engines, for training, and for other local needs.
