Asem,

A couple of other things...

When double click a cell automatically go to the "Editor" edit box.
Allow show / hide of Editor.  Add to menu under View / Toolbars as well as popup menu.
Move copy from Workspace to File in the menu.
Add an icon for copy.  I believe there is an action list and image list you can use.
Rename "Excel Utilities" to "Spreadsheet Utilities" on the toolbar as well as the View menu.

Also please implement the Summary for "WEEK" following the rules from your previous email. 
Thanks,
Will
