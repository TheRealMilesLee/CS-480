Cara,
Yes.  Using CPSSA for CPS San Antonio would be great.

Those look fine to me, we also have one acronym conflict

Constellation Power is CPS  but so is City Public Service of San Antonio.

Can we keep Constellation as CPS and change the other to CPSSA or something?

C

Please review Corry's list of short codes that he would like revised ( see below). If you have any issues or would like additional counterparty names to the list please let me know.
