All they want is a scapegoat for the $140 MM paid out and as we did not make money off it I will not be the scapegoat. Having talked to them previously regarding balanced/unbalanced schedules they will not want the discussion to be diverted.

Thursday works for me.

Doug --

It seems to me that keeping the PUC somewhat appeased makes sense.  I'll try and get some formal questions, but sooner or later they will want to talk directly. I appreciate that this is a pain, but maybe it's a good opportunity to push to get rid of balanced schedules?

Let's sit down on Thursday am and talk.
