Hey-- 

Congratulations on making the cut (I think!)  Seems like it's a good idea to wait things out through the holidays and the start of the year. I've heard a lot of not nice rumors about more layoffs in January... 

Hope you had a nice weekend. Mine was ok; definitely had better weekends, but suppose I've had worse, too.  Now I'm happily ensconsed in my home away from home, awaiting yet another fun week. 

Happy Monday!

Hi,

I did make the cut, in fact I've got to stay around for awhile and wait and see what Enron has in store for me. I think I'll stay put through the holidays and look to make a decision during the first part of January. It looks like the weather will be nice on Friday, then cold and snowy on Saturday. Enjoy your time on the slopes and I'll talk to you soon.

Paul
