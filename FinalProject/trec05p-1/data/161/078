Hello again,

MAN, two emails in just as many days!  What's gotten into you, did you fall and hit your head?  Anyway I do enjoy them and don't worry I won't hold you to this routine.

No new news to report today, only a list of the casualties; over 5,000 out of 7,500 in Houston and 1,100 out of 1,500 in Enron Europe.....ALL GONE!  The people in our London office have the best story so far.  They were given their last paycheck on Friday, laid off, and because Enron had arranged for their housing told they would be evicted from their homes in two weeks, and that they needed to find their own way back to the States.(That's a long sentence) Now that's strictly rumor, but that's how we are getting all our information, and it normally turns out to be ture.  Unlike all the BS our management is spraying.

So we have been out talking to the local folks about life after Enron.  It's actually very promising.  I think we can relocate our whole group of 5 pretty easily.  In fact we think we have almost 10 job prospects and so far 3 out of 3 would hire the whole group.  Two of us are under contract so we can't do anything until they release us but that may be just a matter of time.

I think I'm taking Friday off and going skiing.  I bought new skis and just picked them up last night, so I really want to go!  These skis are a little longer than I wanted, 190's vs 187's, but what's 3 centimeters anyway.  That's a rhetorical question, don't answer that.

I'll let you go for now, but know I want to hear your story.  Or at least what your willing to tell.

Paul
