Correct.  The payments are to employees, who need the funds to pay the IRS with their returns.

Need lawyers to tell us. There was some doubt on whether these would be considered "business" expenses. Michelle and Mary Jean need to give us a ruling. Presume these are to IRS or tax authorities, in which case I think they should be ok? Michelle?

David,  These are 2000 Tax Equalization Payments for employees.  Any way these can be pushed through?  Tim

Tim, 

Attached is a list of the Dec 3 offcycle checks that are still being held.  The employees need the payments to pay the US tax liabilities due on their 2000 tax returns (final extension Dec 15).

Also on the list are employees expecting TEQ payments with their Dec 15 paycheck, who also need the funds to timely file their US tax returns.

Please assist.
