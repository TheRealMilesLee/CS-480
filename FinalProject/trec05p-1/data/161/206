Rodney,

I see in the NY Times that Enron paid out some $50,000,000 in retention
bonus' prior to decalring bankruptcy.  I would like to bring to your
attention the fact that I am due a retention bonus and requested that this
be paid last week.  This was prior to the announcement of Enron filed for
bankruptcy.

I would appreicate hearing where this stands.

Mike
