Hi, I am Julie. Me and my girl friends. By the way they are few of cheerleaders, I am so jelous. They got in, I did not. They are at my place righ tnow, we are drinking liqure and doing girl stuff =), just trying on different cloths and different langeries its fun. What else is fun, we usually hang around on my webcam. I asked to make it free, just to see if you like it. I get bored, so thats the safest way I can go all out and do what makes me feel good the most ;D
