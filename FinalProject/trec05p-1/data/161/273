I think we need to let the power company know that we need to enter into a back up power agreement to be able to procure power in case they shut ECS off.

Midland Power bill is passed due for the month of October.  The amount is 90,148.57.  I told Roger Wieck at Midland Power a check would be mailed today or Monday, and please do not turn off the power to the compressor.  Mark Knippa said he would call Roger Wieck at 515-386-4111.  Karen Gruesen informed me that the payments have not been released by the Cash Management Team.  I would like to schedule a meeting on Monday, please advise when you are available so we can set up the meeting.

James
