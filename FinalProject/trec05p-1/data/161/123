I think we can skip the Thompson site since we only did it as an accomodation (it's not the primary site). I don't think we can justify paying Mancini. We'll need to try to negotiate some sort of free extension. In any case, by the time Mancini's due, we should have expressions of interest from prospective buyers. At that time, if we need to pay the option renewal premium (and we can't negotiate an extension from Mancini) we can pay the option premium.
