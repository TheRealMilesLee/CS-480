RE:		Natural Gas Futures Opening Procedures Six Month Rolling
Open

Please be advised that beginning Friday, December 7, 2001, the Exchange will
implement a six month rolling open in Natural Gas Futures.  The new opening
will be conducted as follows:

During the opening of Natural Gas Futures the spot month will be opened.
After a one minute period the second contract month will be opened, the
first month will remain open for trading.  When another minute has elapsed
the third month will be opened, the spot and second month will remain open.

This procedure will continue through the first six contract months.  At the
conclusion of the opening period for the first six nearby months, all other
contract months will be opened simultaneously.

Anytime during the open, members can trade outright trades and spreads in
any of the months that have been previously opened.

Should you require additional information regarding these procedures, please
call Robert Stasi 299-2067 or Brian Bartichek 299-2057.
