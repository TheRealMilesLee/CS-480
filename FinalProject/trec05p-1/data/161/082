We make every effort to deliver your order promptly and safely. Occasionally merchandise may receive damage during shipment. Please check your shipment carefully.

On FedEx, UPS and Parcel Post shipments, if there is apparent damage, contact the local service office in your area to advise them of the damage and ask for a control number from them. Immediately call Member Service at 1-888-825-2536 with the control number so we can arrange for a replacement to be sent.

On freight deliveries, check the carton for signs of damage. If damage is seen, have the driver note any visible damage on the driver's and your copy of the freight bill, along with the driver's signature. Sign "WITH EXCEPTION" if damage is found to the carton only. If damage is excessive, refuse delivery. Again, immediately contact Member Service to report the damage. We will arrange to replace the item.
