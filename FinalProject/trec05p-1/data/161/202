Anne and David,
   Apparently some or all of my TAC group are on the "lay off" list, effective today.  We are working on a project that will require their presence until at least next week, longer for some.  
  For now, please ensure the following 9 individuals are on the RETAIN notice until further notice:
1)  Chris Clark
2)  Angie Wingo
3)  Jason Loup
4)  Junichi Sugiura
5)  Brian Mihura
6)  Richard Boehm
7)  Dan Orbeck
8)  Don Chancey
9)  Ken Kooser 

Thanks,
Scott THolan
