	Carol,

	We're still trying to collect all the documentation on exactly what was liquidated. We've asked the confirm to desk to provide what they have, and asked Tana to try to collect the outstanding. 

	We'll make sure to copy you guys so we're all in the same loop.

	Thanks for your help,

	Debbie

Tanya or Debbie:
Has this list been sent to Kim Theriot so that they can pull all of these out of the book?
