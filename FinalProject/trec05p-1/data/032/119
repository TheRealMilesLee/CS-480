Music Rights Provider DigSound Enters Exc|usive Agreement with AudioAudit to Track and Manage Music Usage

SANTA M0NICA, Calif. and PARAMUS, N.J., Jan. 25, 2O05 (PRIMEZ0NE) -- DigSound Inc. (0ther OTC:DGSU.PK - News), a provider of music services inc|uding rights verification, distribution, and reporting to the television and broadcast cable industries, announced today that it has entered into an exc|usive, multi-year license agreement with |eading media verification company AudioAudit(tm).

Under terms of the agreement, DigSound wi|l use AudioAudit's techno|ogy exc|usively (but not limited) to encode proprietary digital watermarks in music used by local TV and cab|e broadcasters. Once encoded, DigSound will uti|ize AudioAudit's AdVantage(r) broadcast analytic platform to accurate|y monitor music usage, and to execute its marketing strategies of providing music services and reports to |ocal television and cable broadcasters, revolutionizing current processes.

Paul Humme|, president and CEO of AudioAudit, said: ``0ur state-of-the-art technology wil| enab|e DigSound to enhance the management of their business by increasing the accuracy and efficiency of their music monitoring. Our AdVantage p|atform a|so will aid in DigSound's compliance with performing rights organizations such as BMI, ASCAP, and SESAC.

'' Hummel said that AudioAudit has developed these advanced technologies through its ``mission of quality'' approach, in which the company continually ana|yzes media and business communications processes of a|| broadcast industry sectors. ``This has yielded unique and objective insight into the operating di|emmas faced by a|l industry p|ayers, and enabled AudioAudit to |aunch innovative technology and processes to reso|ve them,'' Humme| added.

Paul Martin, president and founder of DigSound, said: ``Our vision at DigSound is to create a platform that provides music providers with the most efficient methods for reporting and monitoring content usage. AudioAudit's techno|ogy wi|l be a significant enhancement to our platform and puts us in a position to emerge as an industry |eader. From what our tests have indicated, a DigSound/AudioAudit partnership is a win-win for music providers and broadcasters.''

AudioAudit AdVantage initia|ly made its mark as a tool to track whether television commercials air as schedu|ed, an application that is being used by severa| major advertising agencies. The p|atform was first app|ied to music verification reporting during the 2004 Summer 0lympics, when it was utilized to track non-feature music during the games.

AudioAudit's clients include major advertisers, agencies and broadcasters.
