Jean,

Thanks for your note. Please find attached the CA with some minor
changes. If acceptable please sign and return two copies for our
signature. Also on a separate note, we have named a manager to pursue
this strategy going forward. I would like to introduce you to Walt Madro
on my return at the end of the week.

Regards

Paul

Importance: High


Paul,

As promised last week, please find attached to this correspondence a
draft term sheet which outlines six potential asset management
outsourcing arrangements.  These various proposal structures signify
initial steps representing general commercial concepts to be further
refined by a transaction team.

I know that you are out until Wednesday, but I would be interested in
the status of the Confidentiality Agreement within Marathon's legal
department.  

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards, 

Jean
