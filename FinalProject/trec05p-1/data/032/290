We are putting together a college football pool that will run every week as well as keep an ongoing cumulative score.  The tentative plan is to have it be $100/man paid upfront with weekly payouts of 50% of the pot for the high score and rolling the other 50% of the pot into the cumulative total which pays out 3 places for the whole season (Sep 1 - Nov 24).  You will pick 5 games per week assigning each game a priority of 1-5.  All games will have the line as set by the friday edition of the U.S. Today.  The scoring will then be based on the priority values, e.g. If my 5, 3, and 2 priority games win I score 10 points for the week.   The weekly payout will be 100% to 1st place unless there is a tie, the total difference between your scores and the lines for all 5 games will be used to decide the winner.  The cumulative payout will be 50% for 1st, 30% for 2nd, and 20% for 3rd, of the remaining pot.   

We are hoping to get at least 20 people which would be like $75/week and have $1000 left in the pot at the end for the cumulative leaders.  If you are interested let me know asap and also, invite whoever else you can think of, the more the better and we can maybe get the weekly payout to be more than the $100 entry fee.
