For Thursday -

STWBOM will be short 75 mw on peak @ SP15. The three day-ahead pieces were sold @ $27.20 and $28 (BOM sales) and $29.97 (SP15 Peak Day-Ahead Index).

Make real time purchases to cover the short under the STWHOURLY book. Enter an inter-desk sale from STWHOURLY to STWBOM. Then make a sale under the STWBOM book to the Cal-Imbalance to complete the deal.

Also, STWBOM will be long 20 mw HE 2-5 @ PV. This is a parking deal with PNM done at $16 ($14 purchase price + $2 buy-resale fee). You'll notice we'll be long 20 mw for these hours in Real Time Position Manager. Please enter an inter-desk purchase from STWBOM under the STWHOURLY book @ PV and sell this off real time under STWHOURLY. 

Let me know if you have questions.
