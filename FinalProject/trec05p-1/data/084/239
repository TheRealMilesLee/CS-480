 The following was written by Andy Rooney, a man who has the gift of saying so 
     much with so few words. 

     I've learned.... 
     That the best classroom in the world is at the feet of an elderly 
     person. 

     I've learned.... 
     That when you're in love, it shows. 

     I've learned.... 
     That just one person saying to me, "You've made my day!" makes my 
     day. 

     I've learned.... 
     That having a child fall asleep in your arms is one of the most 
     peaceful feelings in the world. 

     I've learned.... 
     That being kind is more important than being right. 

     I've learned.... 
     That you should never say no to a gift from a child. 

     I've learned.... 
     That I can always pray for someone when I don't have the strength 
     to 
     help him in some other way. 

     I've learned.... 
     That no matter how serious your life requires you to be, everyone 
     needs a friend to act goofy with. 

     I've learned.... 
     That sometimes all a person needs is a hand to hold and a heart to 
     understand. 

     I've learned.... 
     That simple walks with my father around the block on summer nights 
     when I was a child did wonders for me as an adult. 

     I've learned.... 
     That life is like a roll of toilet paper. The closer it gets to the 
     end, the faster it goes. 

     I've learned.... 
     That we should be glad God doesn't give us everything we ask for. 

     I've learned.... 
     That money doesn't buy class. 

     I've learned.... 
     That it's those small daily happenings that make life so spectacular.
 
     I've learned... 
     That under everyone's hard shell is someone who wants to be 
     appreciated and loved. 

     I've learned.... 
     That the Lord didn't do it all in one day. What makes me think I 
     can? 

     I've learned.... 
     That to ignore the facts does not change the facts. 

     I've learned.... 
     That when you plan to get even with someone, you are only letting 
     that person continue to hurt you. 

     I've learned.... 
     That love, not time, heals all wounds. 

     I've learned.... 
     That the easiest way for me to grow as a person is to surround 
     myself with people smarter than I am. 

     I've learned.... 
     That everyone you meet deserves to be greeted with a smile. 

     I've learned.... 
     That there's nothing sweeter than sleeping with your babies and 
     feeling their breath on your cheeks. 

     I've learned.... 
     That no one is perfect until you fall in love with them. 

     I've learned.... 
     That life is tough, but I'm tougher. 

     I've learned.... 
     That opportunities are never lost; someone will take the ones you 
     miss. 

     I've learned.... 
     That when you harbor bitterness, happiness will dock elsewhere. 

     I've learned.... 
     That I wish I could have told my Dad that I love him one more time 
     before he passed away. 

     I've learned.... 
     That one should keep his words both soft and tender, because 
     tomorrow he may have to eat them. 

     I've learned.... 
     That a smile is an inexpensive way to improve your looks. 

     I've learned.... 
     That I can't choose how I feel, but I can choose what I do about it.
 
     I've learned.... 
     That when your newly born grandchild holds your little finger in his 
     little fist, that you're hooked for life. 

     I've learned.... 
     That everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the 
     happiness and growth occurs while you're climbing it. 

     I've learned ... 
     That it is best to give advice in only two circumstances; when it is 
     requested and when it is a life threatening situation. 

     I've learned.... 
     That the less time I have to work with, the more things I get done. 

     To all of you.... Make sure you read all the way down to the last 
     sentence. 

     It's National Friendship Week. Show your friends how much you care. 
     Send this to everyone you consider a FRIEND, even if it means 
     sending it back to the person who sent it to you. If it comes back 
     to you, then you'll know you have a circle of friends. HAPPY 
     FRIENDSHIP WEEK TO YOU!!!!!! YOU ARE MY FRIEND AND I AM 
     HONORED! 
     Now send this to every friend you have!! And to your family. This 
     was sent to me.
