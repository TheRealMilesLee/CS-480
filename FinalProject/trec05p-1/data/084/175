I'd like to keep this confidential, but someone inside PG&E's gas group (for what it's worth) told me that participants will have a choice under PG&E's proposed extension of its Gas Accord.  Either the participant can retain the capacity for the term of the extension (less the cost escalators in the original deal) or release the capacity back to PG&E with no penalty.  I'll try to confirm that this is the view among most in PG&E.

Best,
Jeff
