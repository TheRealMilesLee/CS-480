Jeff,

Thanks for helping with Midland contracts, but Credit has one more request. When possible, we would appreciate a Legal Review/Risk Memo on the existing MCV contracts to add to our file. The recent laboring on the new deal and contract has raised concerns about the contract, especially commercial terms, collateral rights, termination rights and the Consent Agreement. Also, it is my understanding that Sylvia would like to continuing working on the new contract and Master Collateral Agreement for future transactions, so I believe that a review of the proposed contract is beneficial as well. Thanks again for the help and I would greatly appreciate any feedback on the this issue.

-Darren
