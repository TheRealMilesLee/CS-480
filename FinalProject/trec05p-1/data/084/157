Sounds good based on 1 condition.  You and ML do not pick up everyone's
dinner.
We'll just go out to dinner and a show and we'll all split it.  Sounds
like 
fun.  Good idea - must've been ML's.

Gentlemen - I hope you all are doing well.  I wanted to follow up with
guys
on supper club.  I believe it's our turn in the "rotation".  ML and I
thought it might be fun to change it up a bit and go some place like the
Mucky Duck where we could eat and watch a band or go somewhere like the
Laugh Stop for dinner and a comedy hour.  We will treat on the dinner
and
first round of drinks.  I would say on all drinks but given Kevin's past
rampages with the bottles of wine I better not guarantee full payment of
that at a restaurant.  If that's a problem, I can always bring Kevin a
small
flask and straw that he can have during the night. 

ML talked to Lisa and I talked to Dax and it sounds like Sunday,
November
11th will be the only date that might work.  Follow back up with me and
let
me know if that will work.  Take care and talk to you soon.
