Hi Julie -

I believe that Mike talked to Dan and told him that he would like to be included in this trip.  Please let me know if I need to do anything more.

Thanks.

Please note that Husker gear (sweatshirts, wind jackets and hats) will be given out on the plane.  


Thank you for agreeing to join Enron at the Huskers vs. Oklahoma game on Saturday, October 27th in Lincoln, Nebraska.

The game time has not been determined (Game time is at 11:00 a.m.) and a tentative flight schedule for the Houston attendees is as follows.  

7:00 am departure from Houston and 4:00 pm departure from Lincoln.    

The flight times may adjust when the game time is determined.  

I will furnish information and directions to the Enron hanger closer to the game date.  

If you have any questions, please call me at 713-853-3597.  Thank you.
