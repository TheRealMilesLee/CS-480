Is 4:45 OK?  Take 128th over to Washington and go North on Washington 
to 136th.  East on 136th to High Street (I think it is the 3rd right) 
Take a right on High street and go to your third street, 135th Ave 
(the development is called the Meadows at Hunters Glen)  and take 
another right.  My address is 1825 E 135th Ave. It is like 8 houses 
down on the right...will be the first house on that side with a 3 car 
garage.  My home number is 303 457-3705 in case you get lost.
