I received a voice mail from Mike Curry, asking if I was still an Enron Employee and what had happened to the regulatory reports that I used to send.  Here are the answers.  Yes, I am still an Enron employee. As for the reports, I have been negligent in sending then around over the past few weeks.  The meeting schedule has increased at ERCOT and due to the high congestion costs a Congestion Management working group has been formed to address, the move to the full zonal model, auction of TCR products, local congestion issues etc.  I have been asked to chair the working group which has taken more time.  Finally, I have had an ill daughter and they have been running tests to diagnose the cause of the problem, therefore, I have been traveling back and forth to and from Austin on a daily basis.  All of this has cut into the time that I used to write the reports and have tried to contact the parties directly when an issue arose.  However, I understand the need to disseminate the regulatory information and will resume the summaries forthwith.  You should expect to get a summary of the last weeks activities this p.m.
