Joe, Drew,
 
Looks like we are on target for the US roll out.  Following a conference call with our US legal team today, we've determined that Metals US will be able to roll-out a Voluntary Separation Program as planned. Plan documents are being drafted and revised by internal and external counsel now with finalization targetted for end of week.  With this in mind the following is our timeline for roll-out:
 
Thursday, 4:30PM (EST) - Presentation to the staff announcing general details of program
Friday, COB - Plan documents and details of the plan will be e-mailed to employees.
Monday, 22 Oct, Official start of program
Friday, 02 Nov, Official end of program
 
I will copy you in on final versions of the communciations and plan documents once they are ready.
 
If any questions, please advise.
 
Regards,
Cathy
