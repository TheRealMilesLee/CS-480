Last night I attended the District D Capital Improvement Prep Session,
Northwest Quadrant, which was also a Super Neighborhood meeting. I was
wearing my two new hats as a representative of the East Montrose Civic
Association and a member of Ada Edwards' District D Infrastructure Action
Team.  Mike Shannon from the city's finance and administration--the
people we have to send our CIP requests to--and David Leal an engineer
from the city's Public Works and Engineering departament were there.  


The Bomar and Morgan high water problem was the only issue I addressed. 
I have some Citizen Request Forms. If someone from the Bomar-Morgan spot
would like to fill one out or help me fill one out, I can hand deliver it
to city hall.  This isn't a bad idea, and it might, possibly result in
something being done between 2003 and 2007.


But I think it's also urgent that we try to get something done now.  Both
Shannon and Leal agreed that it was a good idea to try to work through
our council members at the same time to try to get something done.  As I
explained last night, we don't know what needs to be done: Is there a
storm sewer under Bomar in that block and should there be a drain at that
spot?  (I personally believe in a flat place like Houston and with
Houston's construction and maintenance crews what they are, the best way
to get water away from your property is a ditch.)  


If I can get a copy of the engineer's letter, I'd like to get it to Mr.
Leal.

standing water problem, and it certainly merits taking up again.  It

will, in fact, take an infrastructure 'fix'--a good item for Capital

Improvements and far more likely to get attention than new curbs and

gutters, which are missing in many if not most innercity neighborhoods.
