   Word of the Day for Thursday February 28, 2002:

   ineluctable \in-ih-LUCK-tuh-buhl\, adjective:
   Impossible to avoid or evade; inevitable.

    ... ineluctable as gravity.
     --Marilynne Robinson, [1]The Death of Adam

     California's  vision of itself as a car culture grew out of
     the  impracticality of mass transit in reaching most of its
     scenic  wonders, the innate restlessness of its inhabitants
     and the ineluctable attraction of an open road.
     --"From  the  Land  of  Private  Freeways Comes Car Culture
     Shock," [2]New York Times, October 16, 1997

     Linnaeus'  classification scheme became popular not because
     it captured some ineluctable truth about nature. Rather, by
     the  botanist's  own  admission, the system divided species
     based  more  on  intuition  than  science,  much  as an art
     historian might group paintings into schools.
     --"Cultivating a New Tree," [3]Los Angeles Times, September
     25, 1999
     _________________________________________________________

   Ineluctable  is  from  Latin  ineluctabilis, from in-, "not" +
   eluctari,  "to  struggle  out of, to get free from," from ex-,
   e-, "out of" + luctari, "to struggle."
