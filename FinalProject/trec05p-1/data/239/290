PUC Commissioner Richard A. BIlas RESIGNS
	Commissioner Richard A. Bilas of the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) has resigned from the PUC, effective at the close of business on March 8, 2002.  
	In a resignation letter to Governor Gray Davis, Commissioner Bilas said that concerns about the health of himself and his wife have made it impossible for him to adequately and effectively serve as a Commissioner.  "I am thankful for having been able to work in a policy making position in California," said Commissioner Bilas.  "I hold only good memories of the experience."  Commissioner Bilas' term was set to expire on January 1, 2003.
	Fellow Commissioners expressed comments on Commissioner Bilas' resignation: 
"I enjoyed working with Commissioner Bilas and I wish both him and his wife well," said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC. 
	"I'm sorry to hear of the Commissioner's resignation," said Commissioner Henry Duque.  "He has been a great asset to the Commission, and I will miss him."
	"I am sorry to hear of Commissioner Bilas' resignation," said Commissioner Carl Wood.  "I wish him and his wife good health."
	"I am sorry to see Commissioner Bilas leave," said Commissioner Geoffrey Brown.  "He was a major force on the Commission.  His intellectual critique was always brilliant and he will be greatly missed."
	Commissioner Bilas was appointed to the PUC on January 1, 1997, by Governor Pete Wilson.  On February 1, 1998, he became Commission President and served in that capacity until March 2000.  
A biographical sketch of Commissioner Bilas is available on the PUC's web site at: http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/static/aboutcpuc/commissioners/bilas/index.htm.
