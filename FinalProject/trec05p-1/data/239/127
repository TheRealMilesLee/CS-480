The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Do you know the answer to the tax question, or at least who to ask?
 
Thanks,
 
Kay

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address? 


Any comments or questions?
