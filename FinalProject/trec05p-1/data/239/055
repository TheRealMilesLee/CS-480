  Last night I attended the District D Capital Improvement Prep Session, Northwest Quadrant, which was also a Super Neighborhood meeting. I was wearing my two new hats as a representative of the East Montrose Civic Association and a member of Ada Edwards' District D Infrastructure Action Team. Mike Shannon from the city's finance and administration--the people we have to send our CIP requests to--and David Leal an engineer from the city's Public Works and Engineering departament were there. 

  The Bomar and Morgan high water problem was the only issue I addressed. I have some Citizen Request Forms. If someone from the Bomar-Morgan spot would like to fill one out or help me fill one out, I can hand deliver it to city hall. This isn't a bad idea, and it might, possibly result in something being done between 2003 and 2007.

  But I think it's also urgent that we try to get something done now. Both Shannon and Leal agreed that it was a good idea to try to work through our council members at the same time to try to get something done. As I explained last night, we don't know what needs to be done: Is there a storm sewer under Bomar in that block and should there be a drain at that spot? (I personally believe in a flat place like Houston and with Houston's construction and maintenance crews what they are, the best way to get water away from your property is a ditch.) 

  If I can get a copy of the engineer's letter, I'd like to get it to Mr. Leal.

    When I called and wrote a couple of years ago about his corner, Glenda Scott (I think) said she would dispatch an engineer, who a couple of months later wrote me a letter saying everything was fine with the corner. We all must be suffering from the same delusion. ;-)

      There has been a lot of documentation done on this location and the

      will, in fact, take an infrastructure 'fix'--a good item for Capital
      Improvements and far more likely to get attention than new curbs and
      gutters, which are missing in many if not most innercity neighborhoods.
