EMCA Infrastructure Friends,

Here's what I learned in the last few years regarding the poor 
drainage at the corner of Bomar & Morgan.

1.  Hillary is correct about the method for fixing the problem.  Jew 
Don Boney (fmr. Dist. D Councilman) told us/me at several forums, 
that using official COH channels is the only way to get things done.  
Last year's "wish list" presented by Amy Barnes to Jew Don Boney 
likely resulted in some minor fixes to East Montrose.  However, 
formal requests on COH paperwork is desireable, since the Dist. D 
councilperson can more easily track the progress through the City 
offices.

2.  I requested, by phone, that both sides of Morgan Street have 
their ditches dug out.  Only the east side (309 Bomar and 308 
Willard) was performed.  The workers didn't realize they needed to do 
both sides and said they would return another day to work on the west 
side.  Naturally, they never returned.  A solution could be as easy 
as calling the "Storm Drain" office and requesting that the 
appropriate addresses (401 Bomar & 402 Willard) have their ditches 
redug along Morgan.  By the way, it took about 5 months after my call 
for the workers to do half the job.

3. Candelaria Moreno (405 Bomar) told me that there was once a ditch 
along Morgan Street, between Bomar & Willard.  It was partially 
filled in during a prior Morgan Street resurfacing. The poor drainage 
was a direct result of this work.  Since she has lived at this 
address for more than 30 years, I don't know when that event occurred.

4.  Unless the City decides to build a sports arena at 401 Bomar 
Street, they are unlikely to construct a proper storm drain.  
Therefore redigging the ditch seems the only short term solution.

GOOD LUCK!!!

Your friend & ex-neighbor,
Scott Long
