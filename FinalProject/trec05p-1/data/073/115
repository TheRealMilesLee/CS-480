Hey everyone,
We are having the map guys make maps for each state in our region including Ontario.  These are the items we would like to see on the maps.  If you can think of anything else you would like to see, please let me know today.  The sooner we get this list to them, the sooner they will begin building our maps.  Any input would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.
Lindsay
