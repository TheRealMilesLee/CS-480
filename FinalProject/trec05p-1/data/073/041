Dave,
Paul and I have met and put together a list of proposed items we would like you elaborate on when you come to visit on Oct-22:

1.  How Day-Ahead, Real-Time, and Hour-Ahead markets are cleared.  Procedures for Price Revision.  The different components involved in SCVC & BME models and how they work.
2.  The procedure and rules on how Generators bid in their capacity.
3.  Fundamental Impact on NYCA due to the Sep 11 catastrophe.
4.  Overview of the proposed NorthEast RTO and NYISO's feeling about where the whole process is headed.
5.  Impacts on NY with Ontario's restructuring and impacts with HQ transfers to NY.
6.  How Transmission Charges are calculated when transacting with neighboring regions.
7.  Review the different components involved with the calculation of the MSC and MAC, and their respective adjustments.
8.  Impacts on UCAP due to "New Calculation" of ICAP accounting for EFOR for In-City and ROS
9.  Procedures followed with Load Curtailment and Demand Response Programs.

Please call us should you have any question regarding any of the topics listed above.  We will gladly elaborate on what we would like to discuss.  

Looking forward to meeting you.
