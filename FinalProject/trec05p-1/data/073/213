Louise:

Can you tell me if you have made any progress re: resource allocation for Bill Bradford's Credit Group to process deal flow in the West?  I had mentioned to individuals in the Middle Market Group that you were "on it" and if there is a follow up I can give them I would like to do so.

Thanks!

Chris
