Sorry it was not clear.  We pay them $200MM++ and sell them 7X24 power for $61.  The $200MM++ is the PV difference between $61 and our actual offer ($39).

This enables them to get cash and also recognize earnings on part of their DWR contracts.

Their current capital markets stuff is going well - maybe we're wrong about them.

In your previous email by the way - did you mean we pay them or they pay us.  I read they pay us but Carl tells me it was the other way.
