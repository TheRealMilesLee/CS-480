I think so.  It makes sense for Rick to sign on these accounts.  I will be talking to Tom Doukas in the next day to get him focused on his accounts that need to be updated for Enron Credit Inc.  Thanks .Donna

Donna:

I checked the corporate database and Rick is a Vice President of RAC.  Do we want to prepare new board resolutions authorizing him as a second signatory on the brokerage agreements for ENA, ECT Investments and Enron Credit Inc.?
