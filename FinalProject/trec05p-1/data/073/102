Per our discussion, I am attaching online copies of all of out templates so that you can edit/approve them.  Once they have been formally reviewed with your signature, we will keep template examples on file for audit purposes.  I will also provide you with hard copies of these templates.  Our deadline for having these reviewed by Legal is the end of this year.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you for your help,
Kimberly Hundl x31647
