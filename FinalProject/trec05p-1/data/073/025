I spoke with Mark Haedicke today regarding the recent developments in Afganistan.  He advised that there is no Enron prohibition or advisory regarding travel to Houston for the off-site for our group, but he is leaving the decision up to each individual, based on comfort level and personal considerations.

I have decided to travel, but wanted to advise you of my conversation with Mark.

Regards,

Vicky
