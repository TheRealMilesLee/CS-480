Jeff:  
This is a friend of mine who is an absolute knockout.  She is also a friend of Karen Sussman's, who I understand you know also.  Karen is married to Harry Sussman.  The girl's name is Natalie Newburn, she is 28 and a twelve on a scale of ten.  I spoke with her earlier and she is expecting your call.  Her number is:  713 408-8331.  Call her, you won't be disappointed.  Let's try and play golf sometime soon.  Maybe this weekend.

Best regards,

MAG
