Mark -

I believe this is in relation to the costs for Phase I of the legal website, including development costs.  

If so, it seems all Net Work costs were previously billed to one project code and not tracked per project.  I have discussed this with Kevin Presto and others in IT.  The problem is they want use to pay for X% of the costs based upon an estiamte that we incurred X% of the time associated with those costs.  I have consistently told IT that I needed to have more concrete numbers and support before I can bring it to you for approval and payment.  

If Louise's e-mail is about this subject, I'll continue to follow the same line until I am able to get sufficient back-up to support the fees.

Mark

We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are:

Tim Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power
Lloyd Will for East Power
Geof Storey for Gas 
Laura Luce for Peoples and Global Net
Chris Gaskill for Gas Fundys
Rob Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada.
Mark Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.

Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from Geof who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.

I am assuming its zero at the moment.


Thanks

Louise
