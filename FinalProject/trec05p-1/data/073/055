Hello Everyone,

	We had a few upsets this week, with some games missed by quite a few people. No one correctly picked Georgia
defeating #7 Tennessee. Oklahoma/TX game was mixed, many people missed Ohio St. beating Northwestern and the only non-top 25 game was mixed, with many people taking Southern Miss, as Memphis won 22-17. In the pros, many people picked Atlanta over the Bears incorrectly, San Diego over Cleveland was missed by most people, Arizona upsetting the Eagles was not good for just about everyone, Seattle beating Jacksonville was not picked by most people and Tampa Bay defeating Green Bay was also missed by most. Through all that, Joe Step did only get 5 incorrect picks and has won this weeks pool already. I came close with 6 wrong, but we both have St. Louis tonight. We had 33 entries this week, the most we've ever had, even back to last season, good job!! Therefore Joe won $66. Below is each person with the number of games they missed this week.
