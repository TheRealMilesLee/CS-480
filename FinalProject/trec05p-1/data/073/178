Performance Management for Electric Distribution Companies

An Executive Forum

October 25-26, 2001, Atlanta, GA

 


OVERVIEW


 

Deregulation is introducing competition into the electric utility industry in an ever-increasing rate, and it is requiring companies to consider dramatic changes in their business processes, in the operation of their businesses, and in managing their assets.  Issues such as customer satisfaction, performance based rates, operational reliability targets, operational efficiencies, risk management, and rate reductions are among the new business drivers.

 

With the advent of new choices open to the smallest retail customers as well as the largest industrials, distribution companies are re-engineering their businesses and re-establishing their corporate priorities in response to these new challenges.  This new business environment has brought performance management to the forefront for the electric distribution companies, and they are being driven by regulators, customers, and financial rating agencies to improve all aspects of their performance.  

 

Through this conference, we have gathered leading executives from distribution companies, wires companies, generation companies, energy marketers, regulators, and market participants to openly discuss the issues, their experiences, and their corporate strategies.  Our objective for this executive forum is to provide you with new insights into how electric distribution companies are addressing these issues and concerns, and to help you formulate your own corporate approach to this challenging and complex new world.

Ancillary Services Conference

October 31-November 2, 2001, Denver, CO

 


OVERVIEW


 

The Ancillary Services conference will explore the rapidly changing and fascinating engineering, economic, market, and policy issues related to bulk-power ancillary services. These issues are difficult to resolve because these services are essential for both reliability and commerce, and it is often difficult to disentangle the two.

 

Topics to be covered at this event include centralized vs. supplier unit commitment, integration of ancillary-service markets with energy and congestion markets, relationships among forward and real-time markets, measuring the performance of ancillary-service delivery, operating costs to provide these services, retail-load provision of some ancillary services, comparisons among the existing ISOs and future RTOs in their treatment of ancillary services, and the feasibility of letting price influence the amount of reserves acquired.

 

Electric Utility Consultants, Inc., a long-time provider of timely conferences and workshops for the electric industry, has assembled a covey of top experts to explore all aspects of the emerging field in a conference devoted exclusively to Ancillary Services.
