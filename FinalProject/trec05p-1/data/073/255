Management Committee Members:

In light of today's meeting being canceled, we would like for you to give consideration to Jeff Huff as a candidate for Commercial Support VP.  Jeff has interviewed with Mark Frevert, Ray Bowen and Steve Kean who have given favorable feedback.  At this time, we would like to proceed with an offer.  Please contact us with any concerns or questions by the close of business Thursday.  If we have no opposing votes, we will proceed.

Below are a few points and a resume for your review:

Resume: Currently the second most productive Partner at Diamond-Cluster, a technology consulting firm. He has been working at Enron for the last 2+ years, first for Tom Gros in EBS and Net Works and then for Dan Reck in Freight, developing trading systems. 
The Job: We are looking to bring Jeff in as VP, Commercial Support.  The demands of growing the group require a consistent focus on technology, expenses, front and back office productivity, as well as constant re-analysis of growth strategies. 
Justification: Jeff's capabilities in these areas make him extremely qualified. We rely on him heavily already, but at consulting rates he costs us more than $1.3mm per year and his focus is limited to technology. Most importantly, the lead commercial folks in the group are overburdened with administrative issues and spending too little time bringing in earnings. 
Thank you. 
Mike and Jeff
