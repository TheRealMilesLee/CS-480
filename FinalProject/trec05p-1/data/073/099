The Fourth Annual Peterson Ethics Lecture
Featuring: William Drayton
Founder of Ashoka, an organization that supports social entrepreneurship

This Friday, October 12, 4:00 pm, Wells Fargo Room
Haas School of Business


About William Drayton:
Drayton founded Ashoka in 1980 to use a venture capital model to support 
social entrepreneurs, described by Ashoka as practical visionaries who are 
committed to social change. The primary activity of the organization is 
identifying social entrepreneurs around the globe as candidates for Ashoka 
Fellowships, which provide both financial and professional support. To be 
chosen, each prospective fellow goes through a rigorous search and 
selection process.

Fellows receive a living stipend (typically for three years) and they join 
the Global Fellowship -- a worldwide network of social entrepreneurs. This 
year, Paul Rice, MBA 96, was named an Ashoka Fellow for his work founding 
TransFair USA, a non-profit certification organization for Fair Trade 
products.

Since 1982 the organization has elected over 1,100 Ashoka Fellows in 41 
countries. Ashoka Fellows work in six areas: learning/education, 
environment, health, human rights, civic participation, and economic 
development. Approximately 150 new fellows are elected each year by the 
Ashoka staff.

About the Peterson Ethics Lecture:
This annual lecture is sponsored the Peterson Program in Business Ethics, 
funded by a gift from Rudolph Peterson, BS 25, president and CEO emeritus 
of BankAmerica Corporation. Last year Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, 
then director and chairman of Alcoa, gave the lecture.
