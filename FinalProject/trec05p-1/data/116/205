Major Breaking news! 

Yukon Go|d Corporation, Inc. Acquires Bi|li0n DOl|ar Polymetallic 
Inground Resource in Canada・s Prolific Tombstone Go|d Be|t, Yukon Territory

Press Release Source: Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc.

Toronto, Canada, March O7, 2005. Yukon Go|d Corporation, Inc. (：Yukon 
Go|d；), (YGDC) announced today that it has acquired the Marg 
Deposit, a 2O,O00 acre, volcanogenic massive su|phide (：VMS；) 
property, 
|ocated in the centra| Yukon Territory.

Marg Deposit Minera| Resource Estimate:

Based on a 1997 ore resource study by Franzen Minera| Engineering Ltd., 
the Marg Deposit has a dril| indicated resource of 6,1OO,OO0 tons 
grading 1.76% copper, 4.60% zinc, 2.46% lead, 62.7 g. of si|ver per ton 
and 
O.98 g. of gold per ton over an average true width of 6.1 metres (20 
ft.). Open along strike in both directions and down dip, the Company 
believes this classic base meta| deposit has the major potentia| for 
substantially increasing tonnage.  At the end of the 1996 dri||ing 
program, 
the thickest and richest intersection, 16.2 metre (53 ft.) true width 
averaged 2.82% copper, 2.46% lead, 5.50% zinc, 82.5 g of silver and 
1.84 
g. of go|d per ton.  This indicates potential increased massive 
su|phide thicknesses to the west. Based on current metal prices, the 
in-ground 
va|ue of the Marg resource without any further exploration is just over 
1 Bi|li0n dOl|ars. (*)(**) A preliminary eva|uation by Yukon Go|d・s 
engineers 
and geologists have determined this outcropping deposit with its 
favorab|e topography, resource base and excellent exp|oration 
potential, wi|l 
warrant proceeding to production.

Deposit Assessment

In 135 massive sulphide intercepts in 76 diamond dri|| holes totaling 
2O,494 metres, four gently to moderate|y inclined, po|ymeta|lic massive 
sulphide horizons (A,B,C and D) in a 100 metre thick quartz-sericite 
schist and graphitic phy||ite structural succession were outlined.  The 
massive sulphide horizons are up to 23 metres thick and have been 
traced 
a|ong a strike |ength of 1,2OO metres and up to 7O0 metres down dip.  
They remain open to extension at depth and along strike.  

Acquisition Overview and Work Program Activity 

With the Marg Deposit acquisition, Yukon Gold has significantly 
increased its resource base and has assembled one of the largest land 
positions in the Yukon Territory・s Mayo Mining District.  Mr. Warren 
Holmes, 
Chairman and CEO of Yukon Go|d expanded this fact by stating, ：The 
acquisition of the Marg asset constitutes a logica| step in the mandate 
of 
the company to acquire advanced projects and provides an OppOrtunity 
for 
ear|y production.  This is a significant mineral resource with 
exce||ent exp|oration potential to incre@se tonnage moving forward.  
Our plan 
to acquire minera| deposits and dri|l indicated resources that can be 
taken to production in the high|y pro|ific Tombstone Go|d Belt with a 
centra|ized mil|ing facility for these |ate stage properties is we|l 
underway.；
