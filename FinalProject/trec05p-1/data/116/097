Please find below the creditworthiness criteria for Alberta Pool.  I appreciate the help of Fino and Guillermo.
  

The credit worthiness in Alberta determines the trading limits for each participant in relation to its bond rating as follows: 
Rating		trading limit
AAA		$25,000,000
AA		$20,000,000
A		$15,000,000
BBB		$10,000,000
<BBB		$0

Trading limit is a defined term and means the maximum financial obligation to which a participant is or is expected to be owing the pool administrator.   I am currently investigating of the current levels of our trading levels as that will determine the action required.  

If a participant's financial obligations are expected to exceed the trading limit , the participant must provide a payment in advance or other form of financial security.  This security may be in the form of a bank guarantee, letter of guarantee, irrevocable letter of credit, or cash deposits drawn on a Canadian Chartered Bank, trust company, credit union or other lending institution acceptable to Council in or for an amount determined by the pool administrator to be equal to the expected financial obligations in excess of the trading limit.

It is noteworthy that a rating with a plus or minus sign indicates the relative standing within the major rating categories (so A- is A).  An exception to this is a rating of BBB minus which falls in the <BBB category and therefore no unsecured credit is granted.  It is also noteworthy that participants are required to report any downgrading of the relevant corporate credit rating within 2 business days.

The Power Pool of Alberta requires participants to report any event of default for borrowed funds or a material adverse change in their financial position within 2 business days of said default or change.
