Please find attached files. The first worksheet in each file (Backup) has the Regulatory Assets and Liabilities data along with other Balance Sheet support. Each item has two parts, Current and Noncurrent. Click in the box labeled "Print Backup Pages" (top left corner of the worksheet) and 9 pages should print (5 assets and 4 liabilities) on legal paper. Call me if you have any questions.
