While several weeks ago we discussed making the blanket protest to the numerous MISO filings and request for one RTO, the Commission has not granted our request.  Therefore, to the extent that some truly poor/bad items are proposed by MISO, I think we need to pop in with our same request for one RTO, review all filings together ....., but add a paragraph or two about the truly problematic item.

Since our real time power desk has expressed concern over MISO's proposed $1000 penalty on accepted transmission requests that are not confirmed by the customer, we should file a brief protest.  DUE MONDAY NOV. 5

Here it is for your comments by late morning Monday.  Thanks.
