This was a ground plot by some of the key staffs of this ministry for their selfish interest. It was so unfortunate that they were removed from office resulting from the change of Government and policies, which did not favor their continuous stay 
in the office. This money <STRONG>$11M (ELEVEN MILLION US DOLLAR)</STRONG> is now floating in the Ministry of Finance as a redundant fund waiting to be claimed.

processing and approvals. With the modalities we have worked out, it makes it possible for you to act as a contractor who worked under my ministry and now waiting to receive his payment and when satisfied by the agencies your bank account will be credited within 48 banking hours. This transfer is <STRONG>100% risk free and hitch-free</STRONG> having done all the underground works locally for the smooth transfer of the funds into your bank account within the shortest period. We advised that you should keep this transaction a top secret and rest all correspondence to fax, and phone only, because we are occupying a sensitive position in the government circle and also this is once in a lifetime opportunity. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Finally, we want you to assure us that you will work on our instruction and our own share of the money will be safe. You will be rewarded with <STRONG>25%</STRONG> of the 
total sum for your honest assistance and co-operation,<STRONG> 5%</STRONG> for any expenses that may come up during the transfer while <STRONG>70%</STRONG> remain for me and my colleagues involved in this transaction. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Contact me by return call/fax for any question and further discussion. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Awaiting your immediate response. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Regards, <BR><STRONG>Dr. Terry Wires.</STRONG></DIV>
