Ercot Traders-

We will be going live in the Curve Manager for Ercot on Monday, November 5th.  Ercot South (R6) will be your primary curve that you mark, and all others will be dependent upon that curve. 

I know the first few days will be a learning experience, so when you are ready to mark the curves just let me know and I'll come sit with you guys.

Thanks!

Andrea
