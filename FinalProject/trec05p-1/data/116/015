Do you remember when I was telling you about that 
link I received?
http://www.makeitmetronow.com/html/htm.html

You can file share dvd's, video games & music.  
I bookmarked about 9 pages of dvd movies I wanted.
Already started downloading them.
Wait untill you see the selection of music and dvd's 
- it's pretty awsome.

Theres a few pages in there on how to get your selection 
on CD if you need the help.
I noticed in the movie section over lunch, they have 
titles for download that are still in theaters - it's fantastic.

Tell me when you get back.

Dalton
