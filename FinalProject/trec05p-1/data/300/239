The Sports Zone Seals Sponsorship with NBA
Summer Pro League Wednesday July 13, 1:09 pm ET

UPLAND, Calif., July 13, 2005 (PRIMEZONE) --
Just as they value athletic participation and building 
strong fitness habits early, The Sports Zone by
Intelligent Sports, Inc. (IGTS . PK), can appreciate
the value of aligning itself with like partners.

The Sports Zone by Intelligent Sports has signed
on for a 2005 sponsorship with the Southern California 
NBA Summer Pro League. The Summer Pro League is
the premiere summer showcase for current and future
NBA stars. Hosting five NBA teams including the Los
Angeles Lakers, The Summer Pro League sets the stage
for NBA teams to provide instruction to their first
and second round draft picks in a rigorous and
competitive environment. Showcasing five games per
day, the league runs July 8th-23rd at the Long Beach
Pyramid located on the Long Beach State campus. 

''This is the type of partnership that allows us to
reinforce our mission of helping kids achieve their
true potential in sports while learning valuable
life lessons,'' stated former NBA star and Intelligent 
Sports, Inc. board member, Reggie Theus. ``Getting
a firsthand opportunity to see the draft picks
springboard into the NBA is an inspiration for our
youth. While not all role models need to be famous
athletes, the guidance of a positive role model, such 
as an NBA star, provides our youth with a long-term
vision. Their role models personify the end
achievements of years of hard work and make these
goals more attainable.''

The Sports Zone by Intelligent Sports provides physical 
and mental guidance to area youth through a wide range
of after-school sports programs, weekend leagues and
tournaments. Programs nurture both sides of the student
athlete -- from building the individual athletic skill 
development to paving the way for higher levels of
self-esteem, discipline, motivation and overall
psychological well-being. The Sports Zone encompasses
a 10,000-square-foot facility featuring two basketball
courts and caters to court sports including basketball,
volleyball, cheerleading and dance, and also has the
ability to host soccer, football and other field-related
athletic activity within the complex arena.

With a board comprised of Reggie Theus, former NBA star,
TV analyst, and current Head Men's Basketball Coach at
New Mexico State University, and Kellen Winslow, a
member of the NFL Hall of Fame, the initial focus of 
publicly held Intelligent Sports, Inc. is to introduce
a new generation of youth to athletics through the
development of organized youth sports programs and
facilities throughout the country.

Gabriel deGrood Bendt serves as agency-of-record and 
provides strategic and partnership development for
Intelligent Sports. Gabriel deGrood Bendt is a full
service marketing and advertising agency based in
Minneapolis.
