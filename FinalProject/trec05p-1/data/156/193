Dear Mr. Lay
	Through all of the trials and negativity that is occurring I would like to send these words of encouragement from my family and I.  I have been with this company 21 years.  We have had many wonderful and exciting years with Enron.  When I first met my wife six years ago she was 90% in both ears.  Through the blessing of our insurance plan she now today has 98% hearing capacity in both ears.  The many years of working for Enron has provided me with a steady job and a good income, while allowing me to work on my Ph.D.  The many friendships and relationships I have been blessed with through working for this company will be treasured for the rest of my life.  Yes, I am one of the employees who have lost their retirement, but through all of this my wife and I would like to send our vote of confidence to you and the board to be able to find ways to make the impossible happen.  This company was built to be one of the worlds largest companies through your efforts over the past several years.  Yes, there has been experiments in going beyond normal paradigms and there has been mistakes made.  But through the mistakes is where the true gift of learning and stability comes.
	The ultimate challenge in life is not how much money one can make or that first ultimate achievement.  The ultimate challenge in life is "CAN I DO IT AGAIN?" We believe, that Enron can learn from what is happening and eventually become bigger, better, and stronger than it has ever been.  And we believe that you, Ken Lay, CAN DO IT AGAIN, bigger and better than it was done before.  
	I remember once reading about Donald Trump going into bankruptcy.  He summoned before him the best advisors in the world to pull the most educated and smartest financial people together to find a solution, and he moved on to build bigger and better investments.  "HE DID IT AGAIN."
	The true answers to the impossible come from the heart during our quiet moments with ourselves, in these moments I know you will find the answers.  My family and I have chosen to start the turn around of the negativity into a positive direction by believing that you and our board can make the impossible happen.  We have freely chosen to take the last $10,000 we have in our 401k and invest it into Enron Stock as a show of faith to ourselves that we believe the impossible can happen.  If anyone does not have the faith in themselves to make this happen please let our faith in you be yours for now.  Enron has always tried to go beyond the normal paradigms and can take advantage of this tremendous opportunity to create the impossible and do something that has never been done before. "WE CAN DO IT AGAIN!"
	My family and I send all of you our love, faith and belief in yourself to do the impossible
