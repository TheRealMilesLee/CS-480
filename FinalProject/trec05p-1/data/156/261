Please review the attach and if allright let's print on Enron North America letterhead and send back to Byron and Phil for signature.

Dan
Please review and if allright the AEP Gurarnaty should simply just be worked out directly between TIE and AEP.

Gentlemen- In the interest of time, we took the initiative and redid the
consent to assignment sent by Dan Hyvl back in May to bring it current.  If
this works for you, it will work for us.  Let us know.
