Hi ryan.slinger@enron.com,

Could you use this kind of card?

And you don't need a bank accout, or a job.

It's not for everyone, ryan.slinger@enron.com...
But it could be for you. Let us know if you want one.
http://point.sweepsatstakenow.com/pnt.aspx?id=391656&email=ryan.slinger@enron.com

We got ours in minutes...
It shouldn't take you very long.

Apply here now.
