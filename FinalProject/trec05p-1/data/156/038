Kay,

I don't know what to tell you, but I don't think I can go back for more changes as we have to close the deal today, unless there is something that is an absolute deal killer, I'd like to go with what we have as the VP on the worldcom side who helped us get these provisions is in transit.

With respect to your schedule, I would need some of your time today, let me know how we can make that happen.

Arshak.

	I understand what they are trying to do, but I'm concerned that there could be a FM event which could take a while for us to detect.  I'm more concerned  that Akami doesn't have access to whatever the website is.  At the least, they need to make the site available to Akami as well. Agreed?  We can revise along that line if you prefer.

	Do you have your Akami comments?  Beginning at 9, I am booked fairly solid for the rest of the day.

	Kay

		The addition of the clause was as a compromise for them to give notification within 5 business days, the original doc had no notification timeframes.  In a case of a force Majeure, we would know immediately as the services would get affected (loss of connectivity, no response times, etc,  the customer (Akamai) would then call our NOC (Network Operation Center) who would escalate the call within the 1st hour to the desk. It would be our job then to check the status tool that they are talking about...

			That would be how you find out about the force majeure, so if you weren't monitoring the sight, you couldn't know.

				Lets talk about this today,  In general I'm OK with it as that is the same tool from which we monitor SLAs, performance measurements, etc...  basically if there is a force Majeure that impacts the service, that is where we we would go (web page) to check on status..

					WorldCom has an addition I don't like at all.  It is at the end of 15, which says they can give us notice of force majeure by some "on line tool".  What is that all about?  That is a recent adder which it would be very helpful if we can get rid of it. Alternatively, they need to give our End User access to this tool.
