You are right.  ENA owns the intellectual property rights to EOL. 

Taylor just told me that and explained that the goal is to convey a license but to keep the IP in ENA for potential later sale.  

Also, we are preparing for a scenario that is North America gas and power in Houston, Calgary and Portland at about 50% flow going forward and the rest (EGM, EIM, EBS, EES, etc.) as orderly shutdown over 90 days.  I assume our front, mid and back office systems, or at least parts, would be conveyed to the new owner.

FYI.  

EOL is owned by ENW that is owned by Corp.  Let me know what you need associated with this or not.
