Wollams will be there. Brian and Chad both indicated that they believed they 
were available and interested in attending, yet holding back on commiting 
until they checked with their bosses. Men please confirm this issue to Joe 
directally. Chet is going to some unknown dallas wedding, right? Joe, do you 
want to invite feder? need to send him a email.

All you monkeys can give me a KC check at the party. Chet mail yours. 
Hudgins has already sent his to me.
