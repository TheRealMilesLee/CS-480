Sir,

Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Leng-Hai Kwek. director of
operations
of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branch.I have  a mutual beneficial
business suggestion for you.

Before the U.S and Iraqi war, our client Major Fadi Basem who was with
the
Iraqi forces and also a business man made a numbered fixed deposit for
18
calendar months, with a value of  Fifteen million,Five
Hundred Thousand United State Dollars(US$15.5M) only in my branch.Upon
maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war two years
ago(2003).Again after the war another
notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later
found
out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in
bomb
blast that hit their home. After further investigation it was also
discovered that Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his
official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he
also
confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me
knew
of his deposit in my bank.So,Fifteen million,Five
Hundred Thousand United State Dollars(US$15.5M) is still lying in my
bank
and no one will ever
come
forward to claim it.What bothers me most is that according to  the laws
of
my country at the expiration four years six months the funds will
revert to
the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim
the
funds.

Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as
a
foreigner to front for me and  stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi
Basem
so that you will be able to receive his funds.Please,if you are capable
of
standing as the next of Kin to Major Fadi Basem,you should indicate so
that
I will give you more information.Absolute confidentiality is required
from
you.Besides,I will use my
connection to get some documents to back up the fund so that the fund
can
not be question by any authourity.

I will give you further details of the transaction when I recieve a
positive response from you and also the ration which the money will be
shared between both of us.

Treat as very urgent.

Yours Faithfully,

Mr.Leng-Hai Kwek
