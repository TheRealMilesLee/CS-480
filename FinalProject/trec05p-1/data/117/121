I have sold 3/day nymex over the weekend...no weather!!!!!  Don't listen to
them if they keep talking about this "cold pool".

CIG should continue to be a piece with no weather...injected 220,000 on a
friday!!!  Kit Carson back full again...start watching Watkins North that
constrains gas going south to mid-continent...never seen so much gas going
out dullknife...uinta lateral is constrained.

Medicine Bow is unbelievable...513,000 and constrained...went right through
500,000 where i thought they might start having problems filling
capacity...still better than lucci thinking we would have trouble past
450,000.

Doesn't look like any significant weather in rockies anytime soon
either...if you can...sell a few gas dailies for me.

Thanks,

Jay
