MANAGING DIRECTOR
APPOINTMENTS

From:   John T. Sinnott          Ray J. Groves
        Chairman and CEO         President and COO
        Marsh Inc.               Marsh Inc.


We are pleased to announce the appointment of the new
Marsh Inc. Managing Directors.  These individuals have
contributed significantly to the success of the Firm and
have demonstrated their ability to provide leadership for
the challenges that lie ahead.  In addition, they are
role models for the values which are important to our
organization.

This year!,s Managing Directors selection process
incorporated a number of changes. These included new
selection criteria aligned to the Balanced Scorecard and
emphasized the importance of leadership skills in
addition to our traditional measures of performance.  The
2001 nomination process also recommended that each
candidate be sponsored, not only by the Marsh Inc. Board
member for the function, but also by two Managing
Directors, generally outside the candidate!,s direct line
of business.  This helped to ensure broad and cross-
functional support for the nominations.

The names of these new Managing Directors (including
recent hires) are listed on the attachment below. We
welcome these colleagues to our professional partnership
and ask that you join us in congratulating them on their
selection.
