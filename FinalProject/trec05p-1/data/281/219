Dear Friend,

It is with a heart of hope that I write to seek your help in the context below. My name is Mr. Tony Morgan, an indigene of Liberia but reside here in Europe. I am inspired to seek your co-operation in this regard. Based on trust and because I reside in Europe, my father in-law, Mr. Peter Chingoka, gave me a mandate to source for a viable business venture where he can invest funds of approximately USD20.5M.

He was a member of the tournament Policy Committee responsible for planning the ICC CRICKET WORLD CUP, which took place in South Africa from 8th Feb. -23rd march 2003. In the course of carrying out his duties as the Chairman of the above committee, he over-inflated the contract sum to the tune of USD$20.5 Million.

 He initially kept this money in a safe deposit Bureau in Zimbabwe under a personal identification number (PIN) to eradicate trace of the deposit to him. Under the present administration, civil servants such as my in- law are not in any position to amass wealth. To eliminate this, the democratic government set up a panel of inquiry to probe the financial activities of a government official that is suspected for misappropriation of funds and the mandated decision to seize all his assets and face a twenty-one year jail term.

Based on this law and to avoid complications, the funds were later moved through the help of his proxy at the deposit bureau to their affiliate in Europe where it is kept as a deposit. By virtue of his job as a civil servant, he is poorly paid and cannot defend the source of this fund. To avoid such, he prefers to remain anonymous during the execution of this project. That is why I am representing him.

 Please, treat this letter with absolute confidentiality. I have made all necessary enquiries to conclude the transaction but I do not have the credibility as a foreigner to actualize it. It is on this premise therefore, that your assistance is required, to claim and invest the funds in a joint
venture partnership business on behalf of my in-law.

 My in-law has agreed to compensate your sincere and candid effort in this regard with 10% of the funds when finally received in your local bank account, 5% for any expenses incurred and invest the outstanding into a joint venture business partnership that would be under your direct management. I have completed the legal framework required to appoint you as a Trustee to my In-law, so that you can claim and invest the funds on his behalf. I look forward to your response.

Regards,
Tony Morgan
