Sir/ma,

I am Dr. Abdul MADJID, the director, Auditing and Accounting unit of the 
Continental Bank, and the account officer to Brochem Bereau, a multi 
million and multi dimensional Lebanese Firm based here in Benin Republic, 
The Director Eng. Ziad Al Haznawi, unfortunately died in the tragic plane 
crash of Union Transport Africaines Flight Boeing 727 in Cotonou, Benin 
republic on the December 25, 2003. You will read more stories about the 
crash on visiting the below

website www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/

Before his death Eng. Ziad Al Haznawi has a ten (10) years time deposit 
account with my bank made in June 1993 , which has matured and several 
official notice despatched to his confidential contact as instructed 
without response. No other person knows about this account or any thing 
concerning it except him, and my comprehensive investigation proved that 
his supposed next of kin died with him in the crash.

I decided to contact you to assist in repatriating the fund before it get 
confiscatedor declared unserviceable by the bank. I seek your consent to 
present you as the bona-fide next of kin to the deceased customer so that 
the proceeds of the account valued at US$26 million can be paid to you 
immediately and then you and I will share the money. I have used my 
official capacity to perfect all the administrative logistic to back up the 
claim before contacting you.

All I require is a secured bank account outside Benin Republic and your 
honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that 
this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you 
from any breach of the law. All documents of transaction and data will be 
destroyed with Telex and Info Tech Unit (TITU) immediately we receive this 
money leaving no trace to any place.

If this proposal is acceptable to you, kindly email your following 
information to me immediately:

a. Complete names
b. Private telephone number
c. Private fax number
d. Private email

Sincerely,
Dr. Abdul M
