Kevin,

Attached are two files with 10 years of pricing information.  The following price discovery points were included:

	El Paso San Juan (early years had one pt; later years it is split at Bondad)
	El Paso Permian
	So Cal - Border (Large Pkgs)
	PG&E - Border (Large Pkgs)

The price data is in Excel format so you can manipulate it to suit your needs.  Also, the graph is in power point, but was imported as a picture from LIM.

Let me know if you want to add additional points, etc.

Lorna
