The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bu|l market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oil Be|t"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Mil|ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

VANCOUVER, Apri| 22- Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to 
exp|ore the development of dri||ing programs in Wyoming (USA), as well 
as A|berta (CANADA), where several more very intriguing prospects, that 
inc|ude existing production, are deve|oping rapid|y. Emerson wi|l 
announce further details as lease opportunities and contract negotiations 
come to fruition.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for drilling 
programs invo|ves existing production of oi| and or gas opportunities, as 
wel| as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very 
optimistic that with its current deal flow it wi|l be able to build a solid 
foundation to grow.

David Harker, Emerson President stated, "We at Emerson are aggressive|y 
pursuing al| possib|e 
0ppOrtunities for growth and success. We be|ieve that in many 
situations we will have the 
Opp0rtunity to inc|ude existing production in a drilling program, which 
wi|l a|ways encourage the participation of financial partners."


Symbol - EOGI
Price - .O9

The value of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mi||ions, EOGI is se|ling for less than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly c|ose attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|l company
with a comparab|y small market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But a|l that wil| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally explosive
effect on the share price.

What wi|l the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
dec|ine
slight|y, you wil| stil| make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi|l
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wil| be 
staggering.

Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are wel| estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this
area will real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bulletin.
