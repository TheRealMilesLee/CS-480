General Note:You are to keep all winning details away from the general public to avoid fraudulent claim from a third party, any breach of confidentiality by direct/indirect exposure of winning details/information will lead to an irreversible disqualification.We hope to speedily process all winnings, and remitt funds to you within 7 business days after the finalisation of claims with attached agent/foreign service director. 

In order to avoid unnecessary delays and complications, please include phone number, date of birth, reference/batch number for verification, in every correspondence regarding your claims processing. Furthermore, should there be any change in your address, do inform your claims agent
