Attached are the excel floor plans with this morning's information.  Please utilize these as a working tool to put names on seats.  Hopefully Presto and Lavorato will not make major changes to the layout.  

Operations on the 6th floor are between 401 and 494.

Please phone me with any questions.

Regards,
Tammy
