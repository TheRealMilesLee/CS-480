<DIV><STRONG><FONT size=3>Stonebridge Resources Exploration Ltd.</FONT></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><BR><STRONG>(OTC: SBGX.pk)</STRONG><BR><BR>Equity Structure<BR> <BR>FreeTrading       20,000,000 shares<BR>Float                3,000,000   shares<BR></DIV>
<DIV><BR><STRONG>Overview</STRONG><BR><BR>Stonebridge Resources Exploration Ltd. (NASD pink: SBGX),  is a Nevada corporation listed on the Nasdaq pink sheets. The company is focused on resource acquisition and development for interests located primarily in Canada and the United States. The company has begun an intensive campaign to acquire and develop high value base metals, gold and rare earth bearing properties. The company has a strategy to acquire a large number of high value properties and begin development of them commencing immediately. The initial target acquisitions all have very high potential for moving into production and produce substantial income and profits. A private funding group has agreed to finance acquisition and development of the initial properties under friendly terms
which involve a working interest in the properties and equity in the company.<BR></DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>Value Proposition</STRONG><BR><BR>Stonebridge Resources has a highly talented management group with many years of experience in resource property development. The target portfolio of initial acquisition candidates has a diverse and robust mix of deposits, some of very high value. One target acquisition, for example, has a large deposit of Scandium. Scandium is a very expensive rare earth material which has been used by the Russian materials industry in alloy with aluminum to coat the surface of aircraft. Currently there is no Scandium mined in the free world, and the property that Stonebridge plans to develop contains large reserves of Scandium and Titanium. The company plans to develop properties with many diverse resources such as copper, gold, zinc, talc, platinum and palladium
amongst others. <BR><BR>Stonebridge has an initial plan to acquire at least ten and as many as twenty valuable mining properties within a very short timeframe. In the next several months SBGX plans to control at least a dozen high-value mining properties with the potential to bring in many millions of dollars of profit to the company. The exact extent of the potential revenues is as yet undermined because, although most of the candidate properties have known reserves, more exploration and drilling needs to be conducted in order to determine the minimum value of the mining operations once acquisition is complete. Even after exploration, the potential exists to uncover undiscovered reserves with the potential to  multiply the known value of the candidate acquisitions.<BR><BR>One target acquisition
is about 10 kilometers southwest of Timmins, Ontario. The property already has indicated probable reserves of 100,000 ounces with grades of 0.3 ounces per ton. This medium grade ore in large volume constitutes a substantial deposit. Exploration is ongoing at the site and the company already has a joint venture partner lined up for development once the acquisition is completed. The company has a strategy to develop properties in joint ventures with large mining interests. This strategy allows the company to leverage its capital and proceed with development quickly on all properties simultaneously. The company has at least ten gold bearing sites under review for acquisition at this time.<BR></DIV>
<DIV><BR><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG><BR><BR>Stonebridge Resources is building a large and well funded mining concern with substantial acquisition properties in various stages of development. The strategy of developing diverse properties with various types of rare earth, gold and mineral deposits insures that there is robust and lasting value built into the company. Moreover the chances of uncovering greater value as development continues increases as the variety and extent of the deposits become fully known. Stonebridge plans to develop these properties and get them into production as soon as possible.<BR><BR>The company is well funded by investors who care for the long-term viability of the company and who will act in the best interests of the shareholders. GMCR expects that Stonebridge will
realize sizeable profits of many millions of dollars from the development of these initial candidate properties. Moreover, GMCR expects that the company will continue to expand through acquisition and become a major mining concern throughout North America.</DIV>
