Dear Colleague: 

Energy Argus has just launched two new bi-monthly publications that focus on the European and Asian energy markets - Argus Power Europe and Argus Asia Gas & Power. 

AND - we'd like to offer you a FREE no-obligation trial to both! 

Why Argus Power Europe and Argus Asia Gas & Power? 

Because you need to know what's going on in the international markets. These markets are deregulating and expanding, causing opportunities overseas - and threatening to steal away your own domestic opportunies as well. Now more than ever, you need to be in the know and stay ahead of your competition and to take advantage of these new business opportunities. 

Argus Power Europe covers these essential issues: 


   * Consolidation - who's buying what, and why; 

   * New developments - who's building what and when -and what equipment they need; 

   * Price trends and analysis; 

   * Analysis of the differences in the European markets - from the Nordic market's complex structure and the dominant UK and German markets to the EU expansion's impact on new markets in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. 

   * Much, much more! 

Argus Asia Gas & Power covers the electricity and natural gas markets in Asia - from upstream to downstream. 

   * It's power coverage focuses on restructuring, financing, competition and demand (both residential and commercial). 

   * It's gas coverage focuses on supply to and from the Asia region - including proposals to ship for the first time liquefied natural gas from Asia and Australia to the US West Coast, a development that may have a serious impact on the US's involvement in the region's gas industry. 

   * Our news coverage also details new developments - who's building what and when -and what equipment they need;
