FROM THE DESK OF
BARRISTER JONES ANDERSON
SOLICITORS & ADVOCATES
LONDON,U.K.

Dear Friend,

I write you in good faith, hoping that you will treat this letter as a 
desperate search for assistance in a matter that shall benefit both of us. A random search based on your locality from the Internet produced your name and address and that of two others in your country. 

I am JONES ANDERSON an Attorney to a deceased Immigrant property magnate who was based in the U.K., also referred to as my client.On the 25th of July 2000, my client, his wife and their two Children died in the Air France concord plane crash bound for New York in their plan for a world cruise,  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm 

Since then I have been managing his properties here in the U.K. and some others which he put out for sale. The properties which have long been put out on sale have now been paid for and now the money paid has long been deposited into his local bank account here. I have contacted you to assist in repatriating themoney and estate left behind by my client before they get confisticated or declared unserviceable by his 
bank.

Particularly, the bank has issued me with a notice to provide any of his next of kin or have the account confisticated within a short period of time. my late  client has an account valued at 6.5 Million United States Dollars Only. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating any of my clients relatives for some time now and with no one coming forward since my clients passing on, and with the bank now giving me a deadline, I now seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to my deceased 
client, so that the proceeds of his account valued at 6.5 Million 
United States Dollars Only can be paid to you. This I intend we share amongst ourselves in the ratio of 50% to me and 40% for you while the balance 10% we shall use for settling any miscellaneous expenses that might arise.

I have all the necessary information that can be used to back up any Claim that we may make and I can assure you that you shall be paid this amount as the next of kin to my late client.

All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under alegitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Trust me as his attorney that this is a risk-free relationship. Please get in touch with me via email and send me your full names and address, telephone and fax numbers to enable us discuss further about this 
transaction.

Best regards,

JONES ANDERSON
