Dearly Beloved 

It is by the grace of the Lord that I send you this
letter ,Having known the truth, I had no choice than
to do what is lawful and right in the sight of The
Lord for eternal life and in the sight of man for
witness of God&acute;s mercy and glory upon my life.

I am Mrs Melissa Pointer the wife of Mr Harry
Pointer, my husband worked with the Chevron/Texaco in
Kenya for Fifteen years before he died in the year
2001.We were married for ten years without a child. My
Husband died after a brief illness that lasted for
only four days. Before his death we were both born
again Christians. 

Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a
child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is
against. When my late husband was alive he deposited
the sum of US $3.5M. (Three Million Five Hundred
Thousand U.S. Dollars) with a Bank in Europe
.Presently, this money is still with the Bank and the
management just wrote me as the beneficiary to come
forward to sign for the release of this money or
rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to
receive it on my behalf if I can not come over.

Presently, I'm in a hospital in Kenya where I have
been undergoing treatment for esophageal cancer. I
have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have
told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my
last wish to see this money distributed to charity 

organizations any where in the World. Because
relatives and friends have plundered so much of my
wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony
of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them.
Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand
and collect the Funds from the Bank.

I want a person that is God fearing that will use this
money to fund churches, orphanages and widows
propagating the word of God and to ensure that the
house of God is maintained. 
It is said that blessed is the hand that giveth.I
took this decision because I don't have any child that
will inherit this money and my 

husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want
my husband's hard earned money to be misused by
unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money
will be used in an ungodly manner.Hence the reason for
taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death 

hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going
to be in the bosom of the Lord.
I don't need any telephone communication in this
regard because of my soundless voice and presence of
my husband's relatives around me always. 

I don't want them to know about this development. With
God all things are possible. 
As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the
contact of Attorney who is in Europe as he will be
the one to assist you in laying claims for this
funds.

Please get to me via this email box :melissa@tsamail.co.za

Yours Ever.
Melissa Pointer.
