<DIV>OVERVIEW</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 15pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Global Diversified 
Industries operates in the modular building construction industry, and 
strategically targets the California Education Sector. GDVI is strategically 
located in </SPAN><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Central California on 
16 acres with a 100,000 square foot state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. 
</SPAN></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 15pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Throughout 2003 and 
2004 the company focused on building it’s infrastructure through acquisitions, 
development of a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, and by securing the 
requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth. </SPAN></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 15pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Through the 
combination of its new facility ($50 million capacity), the increased demand for 
portable buildings and the State Of </SPAN><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">California's bond 
approvals, GDVI has become well positioned to become one of the dominant leaders 
in modular manufacturing on the west coast. </SPAN></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 15pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">GDVI should benefit 
greatly from the <B><U>$12.1 Billion school improvement bond </U></B>that is 
expected to be passed by </SPAN><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">California voters next 
month (March). This presents, in our opinion an opportunity for early investors 
of GDVI to also benefit before the mainstream investor realizes who the 
benefactors are and subsequently invests in those companies.</SPAN></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 15pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Global Diversified has 
taken numerous strategic development steps throughout 2003 and 2004, including 
generating strong revenues as well as profits and is now poised for explosive 
growth in 2005. The company is led by a strong management team with previous 
success in building companies into $50 million per annum businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 15pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">In the past year GDVI 
has exceeded its own sales revenue projections, renewed its piggyback contract, 
received state approvals on engineered product designs, started a new credit 
facility and opened its new 100,000 square foot manufacturing facility. The 
company will continue to seek new acquisition candidates through its aggressive 
growth plan.</SPAN></P>

style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">GDVI</SPAN></U></B><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> is a holding company 
that currently operates two wholly owned subsidiaries, MBS Construction Inc., a 
modular contractor specializing in modular construction site work and renovation 
and Global Modular, Inc., a sales, marketing and manufacturing of modular type 
structures.</SPAN></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 15pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Its principal customer 
base is currently educational (public and private schools, universities, etc.), 
child-care and municipality sectors. Its product lines consist of a variety of 
portable classroom designs, including both single-story and two- story floor 
plans. Global Modular's portable classroom structures are engineered and 
constructed in accordance with pre-approved building plans, commonly referred to 
as "P.C.'s" or "pre-checked" plans, that conform to structural and seismic 
safety specifications administered by the California Department of State 
Architects (DSA). </SPAN></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 15pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Global Modular also 
enjoys the benefit of providing educational customers with products contracted 
under a "piggyback clause". The State of </SPAN><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">California allows 
school districts to canvass proposals from modular classroom vendors under a 
bidding process where the successful bidder can provide other public school 
districts and municipalities portable classrooms under a "piggyback contract" 
issued by the originating school district. This process saves school districts 
valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids. </SPAN></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 15pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">A modular vendor who 
possesses a "piggyback contract" containing competitive pricing and a variety of 
design options may have access to future business for up to five years, 
depending on the term of the piggyback contract. </SPAN></P>

  <LI class=MsoNormal style="COLOR: black; LINE-HEIGHT: 15pt"><SPAN 
  style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Modular classrooms are FASTER to

  <LI class=MsoNormal style="COLOR: black; LINE-HEIGHT: 15pt"><SPAN

  <LI class=MsoNormal style="COLOR: black; LINE-HEIGHT: 15pt"><SPAN

  </SPAN></LI></UL>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 15pt"><SPAN

population growth, the State Department of Education estimates that </SPAN><SPAN

more than 2,500 classrooms each year for the next four years, which equates to 
more than 10,000 classrooms. </SPAN></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 15pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Due to the current and 
projected budget cuts throughout the California Education Sector, public and

their additional classroom requirements over the next four years. </SPAN></P>
