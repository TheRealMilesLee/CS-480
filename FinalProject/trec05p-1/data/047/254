Hey. I thought I would send you a note with another way to get ahold of me if you need to. You can email messages to me on my pager by sending them to 8772374503@pagenetmessage.net or you can call my pager and leave a message just by calling (877)237-4503. I thought you might want this info for all those times I am alone and you can't find me!

I can't wait for Friday. Sounds like fun. You are so sweet. I could just squeeze you.

	Love,	
		Me
