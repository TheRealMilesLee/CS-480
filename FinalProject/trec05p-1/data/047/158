What a great birthday message. Very touching. We really have so many memories together. Marty and I had a GREAT time in Vegas. My 1st time to Sin City. We left on Sat.early a.m. and returned Wed.nite. I always write the kids each a note each day to tell them what the plan is who they will be with and that I love them. We called every nite and i could tell they were sad. It was just too long away from the kids. I think 3 days away is the best. Anyway, we didn't win BIG but what a town. So much to see. I had a swedish massage on my birthday at the hotel. We stayed at the Monte Carlo which was fun-it has 6 swimming pools, a lazy river, a wave pool and 4 others. I loved the live music at all the different lounges. Marty wanted to take me to shows 2-3 nites while we were there but I'm glad we didn't preorder tickets. There was just too much to see besides the shows. We ate great. Wonderful restaurants. Anyway it was fun. Claire had her adnoids and tonsils taken out the day after !
we got home. Boy is that humbling seeing your child being taken to surgery and being put under anesthesia. Marty and I just bawled until we got back from surgery. She's recupering fine. It has been hard to keep her physically down the last 1 1/2 weeks. How is your gang? Did Sam get new workers at the day care now that he is older? How is it going there? Are Missy, Andrew and Anthony in school yet? How is Tony. Is the downturn in the economy affecting his business? Thanks so much for the sweet message. YOU are a BLESSING to me. You are always in my heart and thoughts. I just want your kids to know there is an "aunt" Holly in Omaha that loves them too--in addition to their Aunt Lisa and Aunt Amy! Take care. L.Y.L.A.S. Holly
