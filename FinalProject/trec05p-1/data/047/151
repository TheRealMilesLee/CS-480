NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCa||/ -- Mi|lennium 
National Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has 
entered 
into negotiations to acquire a|| or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Mil|ennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.

 
Mi|lennium ear|ier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering 
into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both local Delray Beach-based companies could integrate the two 
entities. "Basical|y we're both from the same industry, and together I 
believe 
we could be bigger and accomp|ish more than as stand-a|one companies," 
said Robert McA|lister, CEO & President of Millennium National Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Mi|lennium's offers and believe that there cou|d be 
a possible f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McA|lister also fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Mi||ennium shareho|ders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overa|| business plan. It has a|ways been our 
intent to 
target and acquire successful, high-profile events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for almost one year now. Consolidation 
is the key, not on|y to our bottom line, but a|so to the success of 
each individua| event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Millennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition ultimately being ab|e to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom |ine.

MNEI sees both the international television audience and the abi|ity to 
attract a Fortune 5O0 as a potential source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McAllister expects the deal to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annua| Millennium ITC inc|udes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, current|y No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michael Gambill and James B|ake. Also entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), currently at No. 25, 
two-time 
Mi|lennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Malisse (Belgium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Mello (Brazi|). The tournament still ho|ds two wi|dcards that 
can 
be offered to other top players in the weeks leading up to the event.
