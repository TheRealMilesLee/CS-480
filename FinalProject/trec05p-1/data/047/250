Folks,

I think you already know who I am, but just in case, let me introduce myself.  I work in the Houston office in Government Affairs.  I primarily work on larger-scale regulatory issues, such as NERC Policy and FERC Order 889.  Some of my main focuses are NERC Policies 3 and 9, the East's IDC tool, E-Tag, and OASIS.

I am fairly involved with the ESC (Electronic Scheduling Collaborative) and OSC (OASIS Standards Collaborative), and based on some discussions with several folks, thought it might be a good idea to come to Portland and spend some time with you. The goals of this trip are threefold:

1.) Make physical contact with folks in the West, developing relationships
2.) Discuss current events in the regulatory arena with regard to E-Tag, OASIS, and the ESC
3.) Observe a "day in the life of" a WSCC real-time trader and a scheduler

To this end, I will be visiting Portland next week.  I will arrive Monday night, and plan on leaving Thursday afternoon.  Given this, I would like to coordinate when would be the best times to get together with you and your groups.  

Alan Comnes has suggested that we address item 2 on the afternoon of the 19th.  That should leave all day on the 18th and the mornings of the 19th and 20th for us to meet and work together.  Do you folks have any preference as to when you would like me to "sit in" and if you would like to have any specific group or one-on-one discussions?  Please let me know, as I am flexible and really looking to learn how I can best support your goals in my Government Affairs activities.

I look forward to meeting you all in person and spending time with you.  Thanks in advance for your help.
