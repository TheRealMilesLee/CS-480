Bill Rapp requested copies of contracts that deviated from our GISB boiler plate contracts.  He was to review them and determine whether he needed to include them in a project he was working on.  Josh delivered copies of the ones Craig identified below to him on Friday afternoon so I do not think you need to do anything.

Craig,
	What is the definition of "non-standard" for your purposes?  Give me a call to discuss and I'll verify. (X36007)
Thanks!
