[IMAGE]	Hello Andrew,   Thanks for traveling with Orbitz.  This is your official "Itinerary Companion" which confirms that ticket numbers have been issued for your "Chicago 1/19/02" trip.   Sat, Jan 19 - IAH to ORD   This e-mail contains your flight information, including your ticket numbers.  Because you're traveling with an e-ticket, no ticket will be mailed to you.   For check-in purposes, you'll need a government-issued photo ID.  To pass through airport security, however, you must print out either this e-mail or your itinerary in "My Stuff" (by clicking "print itinerary")  and bring it with you to the airport.   Remember, you will not be allowed to board or pass airport security without a copy of one of these print outs, as they're the only ones which contain your ticket numbers.  If you're not checking luggage, you may proceed directly to the gate with this print out.   Your Orbitz record locator is 2HSPJH.

Most importantly, because schedule changes may occur prior to or during your travel dates, Orbitz will make every effort possible to contact you by e-mail if your itinerary has changed.  Such changes will always be noted in "My Stuff" as well, and we recommend you check there periodically before your trip.  We also suggest you update your Traveler Care Alert preferences  if necessary so we can contact you with updates during your trip.   Billing Information for this Itinerary  Orbitz Member Name: Mr. Andrew  Lewis   Address:  ANDREW LEWIS 3131 TIMMONS LN APT 1010 HOUSTON TX 77027 US  E-Mail: ahl_34@yahoo.com  May we help you add a rental car  or hotel  to this trip?     Again, thank you for choosing Orbitz.   Orbitz Customer Care  P.S. About 48 hours before your trip, look for an "Airport Ready" e-mail which will contain all sorts of great information to make your trip as smooth and hassle-free as possible!  And remember, Orbitz Customer Service Representatives are available to help you 24 hours a day at 888-656-4546.[IMAGE]	[IMAGE]	[IMAGE]	Sunday, Jan 6
