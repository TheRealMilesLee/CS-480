PLEASE NOTE:

Dan's Director/Staff meetings scheduled for January 22 - 23, 2002 will be held in the Enron building.  Originally these meetings were going to be held at the Sheraton Houston North.  I have canceled all reservations with the Sheraton.

You need to make your own hotel reservations at the hotel of your choice.

January 22 - 23, 2002 meetings will be held in EB13C2 (7:30AM - 5:00PM).  
Agenda will be distributed at a later date.

Call me if you have any questions.  Thank you.
