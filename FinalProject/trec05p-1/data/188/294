Raymond James Energy Stat of the Week, published 01/07/02.

Recent energy investment sentiment could be characterized as a fear-driven,
cautious psychology that has led to a generally under-owned condition for
most energy stocks.  A major contributor to this negative psychology has
been the underlying belief of investors that "energy stocks always bottom
several times before a sustained upward move."  While that was true in the
1998/1999 downturn, we are convinced that today's energy fundamentals are
far different than those experienced in the downturn several years ago.  In
fact, we believe today's environment is much more similar to that
experienced in the 1972/1974 timeframe, when energy stocks experienced a
two-year run-up followed by a recession and subsequent nine month sell off.
In the 1974 downturn, however, the stocks experienced one bottom in the
late fall and never looked back.  Likewise, we are convinced that energy
stocks have already seen their lowest levels and as strong commodity
fundamentals become visible later in the first quarter, the stocks will
begin to run.  In other words, we believe the energy stocks are near the
bottom of a cyclical downturn within what we believe is going to be a
longer-term secular upswing.  That means that now is the time to be buying
energy stocks!
