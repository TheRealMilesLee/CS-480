> November 2001 trade month.  
> 	On August 30, 2001, the ISO distributed a notice indicating that it
> would temporarily suspend making cash distributions based on preliminary
> invoices.  The notice further indicated that this practice was to be
> effective for the June, 2001 billing cycle. Beginning with the July 2001
> trade month, the ISO temporarily halted issuance of the preliminary
> invoices entirely.  Subsequently, the ISO issued a single monthly invoice
> on the date that it issued the Final Settlement Statement for the last
> Trade Day of the calendar month. Thus, the ISO neither collected nor
> dispersed funds until the final invoice was distributed.  
> 	This suspension of the "two invoice" settlements approach was a
> temporary action.  The ISO will resume issuing Preliminary Invoices
> starting with November 2001 trade month.  This is consistent with ISO's
> proposal in the November 21, 2001 compliance filing for FERC's November 7
> order.  November 2001 Preliminary Invoices are scheduled to be generated
> on January 29, 2002.
