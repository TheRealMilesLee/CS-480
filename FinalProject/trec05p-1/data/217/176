Cyndie,
Can you compile an updated list from the one that I sent you.  Diane will have the latest ones that she has requested.

We just wanted to let you guys know of some changes in order to keep the terminations being processed in a timely manner.  It appears that all Netco employees may be taken off of systems access for Enron this weekend.  In case this is true, Darron and I have transitioned from handling these requests.  Greg Couch is going to be leading the estate risk effort and Pat Ryder and Chance Rabon will be handling all termination list issues.  Please send these lists to these three people in lieu of Darron and I.  As a side note, could you send an updated financial termination list(if this list has changed since you sent it to me Kim) to these guys so that they can verify deals are moved to the proper book.  It is probably a good idea for future termination scripts to come through Greg before going to IT because of several book moves we have made to facilitate reporting to Ed McMichael.  For example the price book has been basically split into three books.  Please shout with any questions or concerns you may have.  Thanks.
PL
