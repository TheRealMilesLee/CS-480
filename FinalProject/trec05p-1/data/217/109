I think we should be good on the books now. We also added one new book, WBOM. The only thing not resolved is who will be trading LT-SW.

To be totally consistent from the beginning, can you rename either your long term Long Names to not include spaces between 'North' and 'West' and 'South' and 'West'.  The short term books do not have spaces.

Please note the following changes to traders and what books they will be trading (highlighted in red). There are no longer any management trading books for power or gas. Tracy and John, there will only be one trading book for the st-nw trading area. If there are any issues with this please forward questions to Tim Belden. If there is anyone I have missed on the email that needs this info, please forward it on. To expedite the process for all, Tim Belden will be looking after 2 trading books for the time being. There is no time frame for when a change on this will take place.

Here is a list of the remaining Hourly traders for the West trading region.

Bill Williams
Ryan Slinger
Holden Salisbury
Geir Solberg
Bert Meyers
Craig Dean
Casey Anderson
