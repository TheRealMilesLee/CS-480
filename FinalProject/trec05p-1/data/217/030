Louise,

I have received a copy of a priority list which you had forwarded to credit.

This list is very similar to the Top 50 gas and Top 50 Power lists which we put together with Commercial - there are only a handful of companies different. 

Credit are asking for a prioritised list which has the specific legal names with whom we wish to trade.

The Top 50 lists already have the specific legal name. We will add the specific legal name for the handful of companies which were on your list and not on ours, and forward to credit.

Dave
