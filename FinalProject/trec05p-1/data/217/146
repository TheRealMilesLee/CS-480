Hi Shirley, the first 30 minutes or so were spent on going over the ground
rules that Mike sent out in his 1/30/02, 1:37 pm email.  Then we got into BP
2 on Reservation Timing Requirements and went down the bulleted comments
that Mike sent out with his ground rules, starting with the question of
whether all of the BP's under Order 638 should be in the new BP's.  This
discussion lasted about 30 minutes.  Most of the discussion focused on how
to deal with the various timing issues (granularity, submittals, approvals,
etc.).  Finally, it was suggested that a general statement be put in the
Applicability section that if 638 is superceded, a new rule may be needed on
this BP.

One of the suggestions was that you need to know what your products are
before you can determine the timing issues.  We know FERC will be coming out
with a replacement for the pro forma tariff, but Mike doesn't want to wait
to move forward on the BP's until then.  His goal is to focus on the core
elements of trading/tracking/utilization of rights and then add/subtract
once we know what the new tariff will look like.  It was also suggested that
we may want to set aside a conference call session just to deal with timing
issues to make sure all of the BP's are coordinated on that.

He agreed to clean up the inconsistencies related to resales/notice thereof
in the BP language.  I believe it was also agreed that the BP's for
Transmission should be separate from those for ancillary services (due to
fact that some anc services are purchased in bulk for multiple
transactions).  

Mike is planning the next conf call for next Wed, noon EST and another call
about a week later.  His hope is to go through as many of the BP's as
possible this way.  Today we just got through BP2.

That's about it, unless someone on ESWG has something else to add. 

thanks
