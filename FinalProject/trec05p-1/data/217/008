In order for Wes's team to handle the curve validation and reporting responsibilities under the UBSW preferred delineation of responsibilities between Op's and Accounting/Finance, he estimates a need for 3 people. As I understand it, while in Enron terms these activities were previously handled in Sally's area, a transfer of 3 people from her team is not possible, primarily as a consequence of  them not having bought anyone across in Gossetts team to handle physical business. Apparently these people were cut in the last round of headcount reductions pre-offers.

Bottom-line, Wes needs to go ahead and get 3 people on board quickly so would you confirm how you want to proceed:

1. Are you ok with incremental headcount or does the Energy Op's or another headcount budget reduce by 3 to balance the books and keep overall at 650.
2. Can I go ahead and put a contract offer in front of Kevin Sweeney?
3. Can we produce a standard offer for 2 other people including a sign-on representative of what they might have received in Bonus (these are 2 snr spec level so this would be in the teens).
