Hi Lloyd,

I am contacting you in reference to our Hourly Price Index service,  and as
a follow-up to your recent message to my co-worker, Barbara Clancey.
I am interested in meeting with you and discussing our various service
options & getting a better understanding of your needs.
 I'm based in Houston - and can meet at your earliest convenience.   Just
let me know when you have some time.

Thanks,

Ted Mirenda
