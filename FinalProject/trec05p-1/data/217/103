Here is an updated version of the template, it should be easier to use as you have all split out your books into 3 (terminated by the counterparty, not being fulfilled, and active).  Again, this should be as of positions held today.  Based on my discussions with you so far, it looks like this is doable by the end of next week.

Please call me if you have questions.

Best regards
