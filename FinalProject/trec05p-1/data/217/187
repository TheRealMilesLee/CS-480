Victory

We have a definitive statement from UBS that we can brand our product as UBSWenergy  (OK, so the "w" still sucks, but I'm looking on the bright side).


Setback

We still have not started marketing to our Top 50, due to a) Not having phone numbers for Connecticut until about 4:00 today and (b) Not having an approved cover letter from legal (It turns out everyone thought someone else was doing it - despite repeated calls chasing this up).


Plan

As of minutes ago, I have a Lou Eber approved cover letter, which Lou specified requires approval from Mark Taylor and Claudia Robinson. I assume I will have these approvals by morning and will start marketing then.
