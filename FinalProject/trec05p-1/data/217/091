Hunter,

I spoke with Mr. Ricks about his flight schedule and he wants to drive because his wife wants join him.  I'll book him in the Doubletree Hotel for Monday.  I told him we would probably start the schedule around 9:00 a.m.  If you give me the names of those to interview him, I'll do the schedule.  I told him we would reimburse him for mileage.
