Thanks John.

That reminds me there was a list of action items from our last meeting.
I've attempted to list here.  Any comments, additions, or corrections, let
me know:

*	split list of 31 business practices into market design dependent and
independent - done
*	participate in ESC conference calls - pending

*	distribute latest version of John Hormozi's white paper - "what
makes WSCC so different" - done
*	attempt a correlation of the differences to business practices
(small group) - pending

*	promote registration into the ESC sector voting through out the WSCC
- week of Jan 28th expected ESC sector registration begins
*	confirm meeting for election of ESC officers - done, election at
April meeting in Dallas
*	encourage nomination of WSCC members for ESC office positions - one
volunteer so far

*	Steve McCoy to contact SEGWIG and/or SEASIC (excuse my spelling)
regarding the 31 business practices (ideally the RTOs could review the
practices and cite problem areas) - pending
*	Others

> The message below, from the ESC's Mike McElhany, describes the ESC's
> effort to subdivide its 31 proposed business practices into
> "model-independent" and "model-dependent" business practice sublists.
> The ESC intends to debate the "model-independent" business practices

> At last week's WSCC Electronic Scheduling Work Group Meeting (which
> followed the ESC meeting), I promised to reproduce my breakdown lists

> for your perusal.  Specifically, we in WSCC should check whether we
> concur with this first-cut categorization.  Remember: for this question,
> we're not talking about the pros and cons of each business practice, but
> simply identifying which ones, as currently drafted, presuppose a
> particular transmission model -- be it physical, financial, or some
> hybrid of the two.

> Guess what?  The attached list below, which Mike prepared for the ESC,

> reading my meeting notes, I'm not sure whether this was supposed to go
> to the entire ESWG or only to an ESWG task force (Bob Harshbarger,
> please refresh my memory on this), so I chose to err on the side of
> wider dissemination.
> 
> Unless anyone out there strongly feels otherwise (and I recommend we
> read the actual business practices before reaching such a conclusion), I
> believe this breakdown to be accurate enough to facilitate discussion.
> I suggest we proceed with our strategem of organizing ESWG conference
> calls &/or meetings on the business practices (of course, at our
> chairman's discretion) in advance of the corresponding ESC conference
> calls, now that we know the ESC's game plan.

>   At the ESC meeting held in Las Vegas last week it was decided to hold
> a number of conference calls to futher the development of the 31
> Business Practices.  We have come up with a 1st cut list of the BPs that

> received as part of the agenda for each conference call.  This is not
> intended to be the final review of the BPs, rather it will help get some
> actual work accomplished.  I have attached the 1st cut of the BPs that
> are independant of Design Issues, and ask for input as to the order and
> the groups of BPs that should be discussed.  I would like to schedule
> the 1st call for Wednesday the 30th.  If you have concerns with the
> lists and/or the grouping of the BPs, please respond as soon as

> the 1st conference call will be sent.  Please get your comments to me if
> you are not able to participate on any particular call.  It may be that
> some the the BPs will be included in multiple conference calls, so you
> will have several opportunities to participate.
