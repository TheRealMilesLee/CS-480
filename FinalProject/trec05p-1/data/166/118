PLEASE READ THIS MESSAGE AND ASSIST ME.....

Compliment of the season.

It is my pleasure to contact you to help me out of this terrible and 
ugly situation, l know that the content of this letter might be a 
suprise to you, but even though we hardly know each other I believe 
that you can help me.

I am Dr. Mrs. Mariam Abacha, the wife to the late Head of State, of the
Federal Republic of Nigeria from 1993 -1998 - General Sani Abacha. My 
late husband made a lot of money as the Head of state of Nigeria for 5 
years. He has different accounts in many banks of the world. He has not 
left any stone unturned in accruing riches for his family.
The present democratic government of Nigeria led by President (Gen. 
(Rtd)) Olusegun Obasanjo has not found favour with my family since 
their inception. This may be as a result of his hatred for my late 
husband who kept him in jail for over two years for a coup attempt, 
before the death of my father. He was released immediately my husband 
died and he was later made the present president. He has confiscated 
and frozen all my family account in Nigeria and some other American, 
Europe and Asian continents, It has been in both the local and 
international news.

A look into the following websites will give some insights into my family's present plight: 
http://www.usafricaonline.com/abachaloot.html
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/909972.stm 

Presently, my son mohammed Abacha has been languishing in different 
prison custody in Nigeria for a case against his father which he knows 
nothing about, but l thank the Almighty Allah for his release. Now, my 
purpose of all these introduction and proposal is just seeking for your 
candid assistance in saving this sum 0f $38,000,000.00 (THIRTY EIGHT 
MILLION DOLLARS ONLY) which my late husband had hidden from the 
Nigerian government during his regime, and which is presently somewhere 
in a financial and security company outside the entire Nigeria and West 
African region.

This is a huge sum of money, I cannot trust much on most saboteur 
friends of my family in Nigeria who could not be trusted. I got your 
contact through our trade mission . I deemed it necessary to contact 
you for this trustworthy transaction. All what I needed is a sincere, 
honest, trustworthy and God-fearing individuals whom my mind will 
absolve to help me in this deal. If you have feelings about my 
situation, don't hesitate to stand for me. If my proposal
is sudden to you, all I need now is for you to stand as the beneficiary
of this money to claim it and save for me.

There is no difficulty, I will send your name as the recipient as well 
as the beneficiary of the money.On your identification and confirmation 
from me, the fund will be handed to you. All l need is your 
confirmention of willingness and l will give you the full details. You 
will be compensated with 25% of the total fund for all your efforts in 
this transaction, provided this fund is safe for me in your account in 
your country.

Please this is a very serious matter, it is a save my soul request to 
you and I will be delighted too much to receive a positive response 
from you in order to move into action. I will give you details on 
request from you.

Finally, if you are not interested on this matter, kindly destroy this
proposal and maintain the adequate secret for the security of my fund 
in the security vaults.

Thanks,

Yours Sincerely,

Mrs. Mariam A. Abacha.
