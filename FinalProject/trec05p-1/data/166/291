Following up on Elizabeth Sager's conversation with you Corry as to terminated wholesale power contracts and related matters, and based also on EPMI's obligation to preserve assets for the bankruptcy estate, EAST Wholesale Power's scheduling of energy receipts and deliveries in Cinergy, ComEd, PJM, Entergy and NEPOOL and any other eastern markets should be halted following the close of business today, excepting those scheduling activities in NEPOOL required in order to perform the contracts in effect between EPMI and UI, NSTAR, Central Maine, and Vermont, respectively.  

If explanation is requested by our upstream counterparties, please respond that we are unable to receive due to the actions of our downstream parties (e.g., they're not taking, so we are unable to take).  If explanation is requested by downstream counterparties, please respond that we are unable to supply due to the actions of our upstream parties (e.g., they're not delivering, so we're not able to deliver).  Please contact me or Elizabeth Sager if there are questions relating to this change in our scheduling activities.

Please continue to take notes/ preserve a record of your scheduling communications.
