Tim/Chris:

I spoke to Geoff to try to clarify what needs to be "moved or copied" to NETCO.  Bottom line, my view of it is that the key items that need to be identified today are models and systems such as EnPower, CAPS, the structuring models, etc.  Tim has already identified these things to Geoff in a separate e-mail.  There are thousands of other items such as contracts, customer excel and word files, address lists, etc. that we might ultimately want to utilize at NETCO, but I do not think that these need to be identified at this time.  Although Geoff has indicated that we need to identify all items that we would need at NETCO, my view is that we should not attempt to identify all of these files at this time because:

	-  	we likely could reproduce most of these files or obtain them from customers if we had to
	-  	transfer of such items might ultimately be permitted
	-  	identification of such items by close of business cannot be done in an organized fashion and throwing thousands of such files into the mix would 			undoubtedly overwhelm the legal folks who are trying to identify the key items that need to be transferred.

Please contact me if you have any questions.

Chris

As we move forward in the planning stages for NETCO we need to identify all systems which need to be moved or copied into the entity.  We have identified the great majority of the systems to be moved but we may not be able to identify particular tools used by your group or you individually.  This would include spreadsheets etc.

Please send lists of systems and software required to Anne Koehler by close of business today.

To be clear we can (subject to the negotiation) move/copy systems and some data however, we CANNOT move either transaction data if counterparty specific or data obtained from a counterparty under a confidentiality agreement.

For Houston traders, Geof Storey is compiling your lists.

Thanks

Louise
