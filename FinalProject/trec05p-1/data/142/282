the amount of maturing CP between now and 12/13 is greater than $55mm.

also, note that the section on debt repayment does not have the same language about "after 11/21" that exists in the lien provision -- query whether this would then relate back to the execution date -- 11/12? I think that this should be after the date of execution.

note also, that the definition of Indebtedness picks up guarantees, and that repayment of debt of a non-principal subsidiary relieves ENE on the guaranty, so it is probably picked up too--should specifically carve out.
