Dog Fight

George and Osama decided to settle the war once and for all.  They sat down 
and decided to settle the whole dispute with one big dog fight.  They agreed

that they would have five years to breed the best fighting  dogs in the 
world and whosever dog won would be entitled to dominate the world.

Osama and his dog handler Mohammed found the biggest, meanest Dobermans and 
Rottweilers in the world, then bred them with the biggest, meanest Siberian 
wolves they could find. From the litters, they selected the biggest and 
strongest puppy and trained it day and night to fight to the death.

After five years Osama and Mohammed came up with the biggest, meanest dog 
the world had ever seen.  It's cage needed steel bars that were five inches 
thick and nobody could get near it.

When the day came for the dog fight, George and his dog handler Boudreaux, 
showed up with a nine foot long Dachshund.  It was the strangest looking dog

anyone had ever seen.  Boudreaux said it was a Cajun Dachshund.

Everyone felt sorry for George and Boudreaux because they knew there was no 
way that this poor excuse for a dog could possibly last 10 seconds with 
Osama's big, mean animal.

When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund slowly came out of it's cage, 
wagged it's tail, then waddled over towards Osama's dog.

The Doberman/Rottweiler/Wolf snarled and leaped out of it's cage,then 
charged the poor Dachshund.  But when it got close enough to bite the 
Dachshund's neck, the Dachshund opened it's mouth and ate Osama's dog in one

bite. There was nothing left at all of the snarling beast.

Osama came up to George and Boudreaux shaking his head in disbelief.  "We 
don't understand how this could have happened.  We had our best people 
working for five years with the biggest, meanest Dobermans and Rottweilers, 
and the biggest meanest Siberian wolves in the world.  How did you do this?"

"Da's easy", said Boudreaux, the Cajun.  "We 'ad our bess plasic surgins 
workin' fo' five year for to make dat alligator look like a weenie dog."
