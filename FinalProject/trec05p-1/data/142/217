Michelle - can you respond?  I haven't seen anything.  Also, after our meeting we had talked about making a proposal to them (specifically, we were at least going to describe the actions we took so they might have the opportunity to acknowledge that we had done enough).  I know everyone is busy, but I would like us to get ahead of this while we have a good environment for resolution.

Michelle and Steve,
Have we received the letter from the OFCCP regarding the closing of the Corporate Management Review?  This is the letter we are expecting as a result of your meeting in Washington, D.C. with the OFCCP about 6-7 weeks ago.

Should I contact Rosalee Fleming since the letter could have gone to Ken Lay?  Can you please let me know?  Thanks so much.

Regards,
Sandra
