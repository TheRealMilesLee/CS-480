Mark - Below are the details on the status of our remaining open inquiries.
We could use your help mostly as follows:

1.  Ensuring that we get responses back from Enron Methanol (Drew Fossum)
and PGE/Enron Communications (Barbara Halle).  We have been in touch with
them, but they are still researching our requests.

2.  Getting information needed for the transfer of control applications for
the delinquent companies (PGE, EOTT, Louisiana Gas, Midwestern Gas and
Magnolia Construction).  We will need details on all of the transactions and
will need to figure out who will sign the applications. 

3.  Getting contact information for the companies listed in III., below, for
