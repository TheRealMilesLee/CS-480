In my discussions with Andrea Lang today she is very keen to start some dialogue on transition. I have expressed my concerns about timing given what we have ahead of us over next 6 weeks but she would like at least provisionally to have a discussion about certain aspects of the transition process sometime in December. I will update you, but I have initially (given her intended process plan requirements) indicated that each of you may be involved. Please do not share this widely and bear in mind I may need to change/add to this list once I have a clearly picture of what is needed.

David
