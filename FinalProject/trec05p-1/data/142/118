Let's have it!  We want your questions about anything and everything surrounding Sooner sports.  We'll take your questions such as, 'When is Andre Woolfolk coming back?' and 'What happens to OU's BCS rating if Colorado beats Nebraska?' and Sooners Illustrated will answer your questions and send them back to everyone through our email list!

Injuries, recruiting, bowl possibilities: the list is endless.  We'll find the answers.

All you have to do is send your questions into asksi@soonersillustrated.com to have the answers you are aching to know. Include your name (first, last, or whatever) and your location and we might even print your questions in Sooners Illustrated's magazine.

We look forward to your questions!

Thanks and Boomer Sooner!,

Sooners Illustrated
