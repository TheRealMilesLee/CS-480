Please I humbly beg you from the bottom of my heart to listen very carefully, the situation in my country is very critical and chaos, uproar and hostilities had brought the country to its knees and from intelligent report the center cannot hold anymore for former president Charles Taylor and his government.

The intense pressure from united states, united nations, international community and west African peace keeping to[Ecomog] had made him former president Charles Taylor to step aside and gone on exile and also pressure to face war crime charges against humanity.

Listen very carefully, you know my country Liberia is very rich with diamonds, and with my position as former chief of security and operations I have accumulated so much diamonds which I had sold to generate close to $30 Million over the years and it is this fund that I want to move to you for safe keeping.

Please would you do me a favour to receive this fund for me? Else the government in power will seize the fund and plunder it. If you are capable and know that you will truly and honestly help me, write me now, time is no more on my side.

I will give you 30% of the fund and I will come to your country to take my part. Extend a friendly hand and help me. Please bear in mind that this fund is not a loaned or stolen money but rather a hard earned money generated.

If you are willing to help me in this transaction,please furnish me with the followings:

(1) Your telephone number, Fax number (Mobile phone if any)
