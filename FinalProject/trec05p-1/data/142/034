Hi Students,<br>
<br>
<b><u>Ignore this if you are graduating this Semester or did not Bid for
classes.<br>
<br>
<br>
</u></b>Now that bidding is over and you are enrolled in classes we would
like to get some feedback on the&nbsp; bidding process, and the On-Line
Registrar application itself:<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Overall how would you rate the new registration&nbsp; process?<br>
<br>
2. Which do you like better, the On-Line Registrar, or Telebears?<br>
<br>
3. Any suggestions for the administrative process? ie scheduling,
distribution of information ect..<br>
<br>
4. Any suggestions about the computer application, On-Line
Registrar?<br>
<br>
5. Any further insight or comments would be greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
6. Would you rather receive program materials via email or postal
mail?<br>
<br>
Please be honest, you won't hurt our feelings, and it won't hurt your
chances of getting into classes. I promise. This program is supposed to
make things easier for you, so please help us make it run as smoothly as
possible.<br>
<br>
Thanks, <br>
Josh Bortman<br>
