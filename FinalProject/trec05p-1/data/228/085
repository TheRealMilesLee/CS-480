Please RSVP if you are coming to the Valentines  Party. I sure hope you can make it! I promise it will be fun!!! don't be a  party-pooper! 
 
Moms, the the LRC has asked us not to allow food in  the babysitting room. Sorry for the inconvenience. 
 
Hope to see you Thurs. night! Tell your sweetie he  can just watch if he doesn't want to work out. But I promise it will be a  "man-friendly" workout. All Body sculpting, no shaking your booty!
 THANKS!     LIZ
