(for Platts Premium Customers)

along with economic growth and environmental protectionism. Indeed it scarcely
seems possible to have a discussion in Japan on any aspect of energy without it

of developing gas pipelines to promote regional energy interdependence in
Northeast Asia, it is scarcely surprising that energy security issues are very
much at the forefront of Japanese thinking. (http://www.einsight.com)
