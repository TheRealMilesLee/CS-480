I believe John Millar works for Eric Gadd in Business Development. If my sources are correct, John is a former EOTT employee. We are looking to possibly use John, if he available, in a special and critical role regarding EOTT pipeline integrity. This would likely be at least a six month, and maybe a year long effort.

Give me a call.
