Since there will be no Mark Report today (due to the fact I need to catch a plane), The AGA number today was an injection of 15 BCF, with a revision from last week of +10 BCF to bring the total storage to 3.132 TCF or 484 BCF above last year and 313 BCF above the 5 yr average.

Have a great Thanksgiving! See ya Monday!
