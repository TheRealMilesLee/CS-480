MICROSOFT'S 'VISIONARY' SETTLEMENT 
Microsoft settles some dubious claims in a way it calls 
"visionary," but which looks opportunistic.

MAXTOR DRIVES HARD
Five years ago, it was an industry laggard. Now it leads the PC 
hard drive market.

GOVERNMENT BY TAX CREDIT
Install a solar-heated spa. Hire an ex-con. Maybe even go on 
vacation. Then claim a tax credit.

firms are hoping for some financial alchemy.
