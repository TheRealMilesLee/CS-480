Lindy, Tony and Sam:

Wishing you a happy "Turkey Day!"  We will be thinking about you and
wishing we could be together. I know it will be fun time for your
family.  I was looking at your weather and it looked cool for Houston.

We are going to Happy Hollow with Jodeen and her family and looking
forward to their good food.  We won't have leftovers but I don't have to
cook either so the trade off is pretty good.

Give Sam hugs and kisses from us.

Love and miss you!

Dad & Flo
