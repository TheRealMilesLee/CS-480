Dear Sir/Madam

I am Mr.Charles Ghankay Taylor Jr the son of Mr. Charles Taylor, the 
Former president of war torn Federal Republic of Liberia in West Africa.

Due to the ugly events taking place in my Country although my father
has handed over power to his Vice president for peace to reign,who have
now handed over to an interim Government, We are now forced to live in
exile due to high pressure from International communities.
Before this situation degenerated to this stage my father use his 
political position to deposit the sum of $20.7million (Twenty million seven 
hundred thousand US dollar) to a security/finance company in Europe with 
my maiden name, whose location will be revealed to you after your
response,indicating your Interest to assist us.
This money was moved safely to the Security/Finance company in
concealed boxes as family valuables and precious items. He used this 
method/means to transfer the boxes safely through a diplomatic channel.
Due to the our present condition, I search for a trusted foreigner who
Will assist us to lift the funds safely out of the security company and
deposit it in his account for safety purpose. You will also help the 
entire family to invest this money in any lucrative ventures in your 
country but my family will like to invest some of the money in real estate 
and other business venture in due course.
All relevant documents that will facilitate the processing of the fund 
from the security vault are with the family attorney in the western 
world(EUROPE).We are going to begin the process of changing the 
beneficiary In your favour to enable you claim the funds from the =
security/finance 
company, by the time I have established confidence in you and your 
readiness and competence to be very swiftly and sincere to handle this 
business with us.
I want you to know that due to our position in exile here in Nigeria

me. As soon as the consignment is out from the finance company and the
Transfer made, you will be compensated with 30% of the total sum, while
the remaining will be for investment.
