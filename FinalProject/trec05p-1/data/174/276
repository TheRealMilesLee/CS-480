Kim, here are my thoughts based on the pool available:

Bonus:
Lorraine		35,000	(40,000 last year)
TK		35,000	(23,000 last year)Note: She would only get 27,500 more because of the other 7,500 as part of the Danny deal.
Michelle	20,000  (8,700   last year which was prorated by one-half)
Mark		15,000
Paul		15,000

With these numbers, I will still need to go back to Danny and ask for an additional amount because I still need more for others in the group. Let's discuss this when you get a chance. I need to give the numbers to Danny and Fran by December 27.

Merit:
Lorraine		9.5% (This should bring Lorraine closer to the others).
TK		3%
Michelle	3%		
Mark		3%
Paul		3%
