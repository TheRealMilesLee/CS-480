> Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a 
> slowdown in the performance of flower and jewelry applications that had 
> operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0 
> uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.9,and
> installed 
> undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0. 
> 
> Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes 
> the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to 
> no avail. What can I do?

> Dear Desperate,

> First, keep in mind that Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package, 
> while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Install Tears 6.2 and enter the 
> command <C:\ I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME>. 
> 
> Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Guilty 3.0 and 
> Flowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to 
> Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad 
> program that will create Snoring Loudly.WAV files. 
> 
> DO NOT install Mother-in law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend 
> program. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0. 
> 
> In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a 
> limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might
> consider 
> buying additional software to improve performance. I personally recommend 
> Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 6.9. 
> 
> Good luck.
