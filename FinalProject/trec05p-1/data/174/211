Thanks, Kalen.

All,  

The employee is to purchase their own one way, non-refundable ticket and submit for reimbursement to the following:

John Branigan or
Willie Bailey
The MI Group
3500 Claymoore Park Drive
Houston, TX  77043
Tel	713 460 0192 or 1 800 223 7911
Fax	713 460 4382

Note that we will only reimburse up to the budgets provided by Travel Agency in The Park.  The employee should contact The MI Group for the budgeted amount and use TAP, if they are having trouble meeting the budget.

Tickets will be reimbursed for the H-B visa holder only.  Family members are not eligible, nor is any type of shipment for the H-1B holder unless they have an assignment letter covering additional relocation.

Attached are the L1 and H1-B termed employees.  Please identify your termed employees from the list (1st attachment and tab 1 are L1's, second attachment, tab 1 are H1-Bs)

Please let the H1-B termed employees know that we will pay for the employee's return ticket home (coach).  Tim Callahan will let you know who to contact to reimburse them for the cost of the ticket.

For the L1 holders, Enron is only obligated to conform with the obligations in the transfer letter, so you will need to pull their letter from the file and review with Tim Callahan.
