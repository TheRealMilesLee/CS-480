<P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=-1><B>XNOM</B> is one of the new ideas recently 
introduced. I realize this is a completely undiscovered stock with a very 
limited trading history, so it will take some time to develop the story. As time 
goes by, the audience for this stock will grow.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=-1>The company owns the rights to develop 
applications for the use of transrenal DNA. To me, the is absolutely fascinating 
technology, and it will be very interesting to see this company develop 
commercial applications for this discovery.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=-1>In the 1980's the medical community believed 
that DNA in the blood stream was filtered out through the kidneys. Russian 
scientists who were researching radiation poisoning from the Chenobyl disaster 
discovered this was not the case.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=-1>DNA can provide you will a lot of 
information about what's happening in the body. For example, fetal DNA can be 
found in the mother's urine. DNA from a transplanted organ can be found in the 
recipients urine. DNA from cancer cells, which almost have a life of their own, 
can be found in urine. Heretofore, it was difficult to locate and retrieve this 
DNA without highly invasive surgery.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=-1>In order to manage and protect the myriad of 
potential applications for transrenal DNA, <B>XNOM</B> has recruited one of the 
biggest guns in the industry.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=-1>Dr. David Ladner has been awarded the 
position of Director of Licensing and Intellectual Property. There is a lot of 
information about Dr. Ladner in the press release below.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=-1>Prior to coming over to fledgling 
<B>XNOM</B>, Dr. Lander was a manager of Intellectual Property at Bayer 
Pharmaceutical Division for the last five years, where he handled patent filing 
and prosecution for Chemical Research. He also served as Patent Liaison as well 
as Research Manager at American Cyanamid Co., for over 20 years, overseeing key 
aspects of patents and intellectual property. Dr. Ladner holds 22 patents 
himself, and has published widely in professional journals.</FONT></FONT> </P>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Xenomics is a molecular diagnostic company that focuses on the development 
of DNA-based tests using trans-renal DNA (Tr-DNA). Xenomics' patented technology 
uses safe and simple urine collection and can be applied to a broad range of 
testing including: prenatal testing; tumor detection and monitoring; tissue 
transplantation; infectious disease; forensic identity; drug development and 
bioterrorism.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;Xenomics believes that its technology will open new molecular 
markets. Xenomics' scientists were the first to report that a portion of DNA 
from normal cell death throughout the body not only appears in the bloodstream 
but crosses the kidney barrier and can be detected in urine. Xenomics has 3 
issued patents covering different applications of the technology for molecular 
diagnostics and genetic testing. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Xenomics has organized a joint venture to conduct research on infectious 
disease detection with the Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious 
Diseases (Instituto Nazionale per le Malattie Infettive) in Rome, Italy, in the 
form of a new R&amp;D company called SpaXen Italia, S.R.L. </DIV>
