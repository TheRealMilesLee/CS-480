The lease is freely assignable. The lien rights are based not contractual, but exist in Texas law.  I used to have some info on Texas lien law, don't remember if I still do. I haven't worked a warehouseman lien issue. However, in general it is one thing to have a lien, and another to be able to foreclose on it, especially that quickly. In short, I don't know if whatever Morris is saying they will do in the timeframe described is permissible. 

Rigby, you have any info on warehouseman liens in Texas?

Still looking for a copy of the letter from Morris. My fax number is 63491 if someone has it handy.

Thanks,

Kay

Please provide me with any comments to the letter.  I can work with Lorie to get it revised and send it out once we receive a consensus.
