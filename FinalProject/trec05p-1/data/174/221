For those that use and rely upon the ETS Safety Connection Calendar, please
be aware there is a discrepancy in December. The December calendar states
the 25th and 26th are Enron holidays. It should state the 24th and 25th.

Please refer to http://hrweb.enron.com/infozone/holidayCalender/Default.asp
for any calendar concerns.

I apologize for any confusion this may have generated.

January 2002 apparently was printed incorrectly also.

Gary Allen
