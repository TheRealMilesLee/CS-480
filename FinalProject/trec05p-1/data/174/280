MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT:

ANNUAL MEETING AND ELECTION OF 2002 WENH BOARD

Dear Members:

The  annual meeting of the Women's Energy Network of Houston is normally
held at the November or December luncheon meeting.  This year, however, WENH 
held two out-of-the-ordinary events in November and December that precluded
the annual meeting from being held in those months.  WENH's bylaws provide
that "if the December meeting is not held, the annual meeting shall be held
at the next WENH meeting."  Accordingly, the WENH Board of Directors has
scheduled the annual meeting to be held at our January luncheon meeting at
Brennan's Restaurant, 3300 Smith St., on January 9, 2002, at 12:00 p.m.

At the annual meeting, the WENH membership in attendance will elect the
Officers and Directors of the WENH Board of Directors for 2002.  No WENH
member may vote by proxy.  Following careful deliberation of all nominated
candidates, the Nominating Committee, composed of Leesa Foster, President;
Robin Dyer, Immediate Past President; Lisa Craig, Vice President and
retiring Board member; Meg Healy, WENH member; and Karyl Lawson, WEHN member
(with Denise Cassata, WENH member, as a substitute at the Nominating
Committee's final meeting) hereby announces its recommended slate for the
upcoming elections at the annual meeting, as follows:
