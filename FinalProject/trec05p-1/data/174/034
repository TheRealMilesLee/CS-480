Kevin,

I'm attaching the template of the 2 week cash flow forecast.  I broke it down into peak and off-peak sections for next week and the following week - by counterparty, by region, and by sell/buy.  I have two separate sheets in the file according to the way it is sorted - one is by counterparty and the other is by region.  Keep in mind that the ancillaries have a fixed price of zero because the load deals were done based upon a bundled 24-hour energy price which included the cost of the ancillaries.  The column titled "Fill Price" is for you to fill in.  Also, I've explained the template to Don Miller so all you will need to do is forward it on to him once you enter your prices and he will understand it all.

I'll call you in the morning to make sure all is well!

-Casey
