VIRAL GENETICS, INC.

	December, 2001
HIGHLIGHTS

*	Viral Genetics has developed a revolutionary new technology called 
TNP which, based on clinical results to date, not only stops but also 
reverses the progression of HIV infection in people.
*	TNP is an extracted, naturally occurring, biologically active linear 
protein which, when purified and modified, greatly stimulates the 
body's immune response system.
*	Three months after an eight week TNP treatment, 8 out of 10 
terminally ill AIDS patients in clinical trials show virtually no sign of 
HIV infection.
*	TNP treated patients display virtually no side effects to treatment.
*	TNP technology is patented in 16 countries and patent pending in 
Canada and the U.S.
*	Treatments are far less costly and less cumbersome than currently 
employed alternatives.

OVERVIEW

Viral Genetics, Inc. was founded in 1995 to develop and commercialize 
therapeutic and diagnostic systems for the treatment of viral diseases.  
Their primary focus has been on finding a treatment which would stop 
and reverse the progression of HIV infection in humans.  After 
expenditures in excess of $8M, Viral Genetics developed their core 
technology - TNP (Thymus Nuclear Protein).

Since TNP's discovery, Viral Genetics has conducted numerous animal 
studies and three human clinical trials.  Each human trial consisted of 10 
to 20 patients in the late stages of infection.  TNP was administered by 
intra-muscular injection bi-weekly over an eight week period.  Follow 
up was carried out on all the patients anywhere from 50 to 667 days 
after treatment.  The trials revealed the following incredible results with 
respect to TNP's efficacy and safety:

-	HIV viral levels were reduced by 90% even 18 months after 
treatment.
-	Patients experienced minimal side effects during treatment which 
completely subsided after treatment and remained that way even 18 
months after treatment.
-	Dramatic reductions occurred even with HIV resistant strains that no 
Antiviral Drug Cocktail has shown any efficacy with whatsoever.
-	Most patients started to regain body weight during and after TNP 
treatment.

Viral Genetics is in discussions with a number of world wide 
governments to commercialize the TNP technology.
