Dear, 
 
I am Louis E. Mahati leader of four member(FEDERAL AUDIT COMMITTEE) draft=
ed
by the present civilian  Government of Nigeria to look into contracts (lo=
cal
 and Foreign) awarded by various ministries and parastatals of the Federa=
l
Government,from 2002 to date. 
 
During the course of our investigation, we  discovered an accumulated sum=

of US$13.6 in suspense account of Bank of federation,Upon inquiry we disc=
overed
that the money came about as a result of over-invoiced 
contract value awarded to a foreign contractor by some offcials that infl=
ated
the original contract value to the above stated amount,no Nigerian citize=
n
or company can lay claim to this fund.I wish to solicit your consent in
transferring the sum of US$13.6(Thirteen
million six Hundred Thousand US Dollars only).
 
The government have started reimbursement of all outstanding debt to fore=
ign
contractors from 1999 to date. We that comprises the Federal Audit Commit=
tee
perfected a risk free plan to include a Foreign
contractor to act as beneficiary who will help us make claims to this sum=

of US$13.6 as value of the contract executed. To achieve this, your suppo=
rt
is imperative.

Our duty in the committee are follows: 
 
(a) To internally ascertain the authenticity of all
 departmental requisition and operations performed. 
 
(b) To verify the existence and value of goods
supplied, services rendered, contracts carried out and
foreign contractors fit for payment. 
 
I have therefore, been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues to
look for a partner into whose account,we can transfer this over-invoiced
sum hence I am writing to you this letter.It may also please you to know
that all the goods that  cover the payment are
on record, only us that are key members of the contract board committee
has this knowledge and information. 
Now my dear friend, what I want you to do is to act as the beneficiary of=

this contract claim. We can get you properly registered as one of the con=
tractors,
who has already been awarded part of this contract.The above stated sum
will be trusted to you provided you are capable of handling such huge  am=
ount
of money.  
Finally, I will like this arrangement to be concluded as soon as possible=

to enable my colleagues and I perfect our reports,The nature of your comp=
any
or business does not necessarily matter.Neither the
ownership of a company any criteria for the project. 
 
However, you are advised to handle this transaction
with absolute confidentiality. 
 
I look forward to your prompt reply. 
 
Yours faithfully, 

Louis Mahati.(lomaha@freenet.de)=20
