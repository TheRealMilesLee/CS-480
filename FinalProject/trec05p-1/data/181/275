Do people compliment you on your eyes?  They are striking.  I am sure you hear it all the time and hopefully do not tire of the compliments.  

My profile is cookiemonster8 and I am not allowed to send photos over the match system.  They will send the mean police after me.  If you trust me with your email address, I can send you some photos that way.

Hope you are enjoying the holidays and hope to hear from you!

ADDITIONAL TIPS from Match.com:

Our anonymous re-mailer will strip away your real email address, so 
that it will NOT appear in the 'From:' line.

You may also contact this person from their Match.com profile by 
clicking 'Contact this person' and composing your message directly from the 
site.

However:

* Check to ensure that your email address is not in the BODY of your 
message as we are unable to remove these.

* Check to ensure that you REMOVE ANY AUTOMATIC SIGNATURE at the end of 

your email. And note that you cannot use 'Cc:' or 'Bcc:' if you want 
your email to remain anonymous.

Match.com does not monitor private email between members, nor are we
