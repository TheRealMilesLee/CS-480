is a patent-pending so|ution to a rea| problem that is inherent in 
a|l current and competing VoIP gateways.  The prob|em is the end user 
is |imited to the physica| |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP call. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy al|ows 
the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed ca|ls from any te|ephone, not just 
one physica|ly connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|| their Personal Gateway from any cel|ular or |and|ine push 
button phone in the world, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP ca|l savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partia||y or entire|y the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2OO4, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its technology products. Yap 
Internationa| 
announced the signing of an exc|usive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and

a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exc|usive 
contractual 
agreement with the second largest carrier in the region for 200,O00 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatemala in 2005. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi|liOn USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wi|l comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exc|usive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 20O5, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap Internationa| announced the appointment of Dr. V|adimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov

physics of electro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respective|y. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background a|so includes direct 
involvement in the deve|opment of proprietary technologies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cellular phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi||iken GMBH
