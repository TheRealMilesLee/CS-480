<body>Pulling The Plug on Living Wills

Dr. James Hall was once committed to dying if incapacitated. <br>
"Pull the plug," he had said. <br><br>

But, now that he is dying, he has changed his mind. He has experienced a
<br>
pontine stroke, the most serious and devastating form of stroke known to
medicine, <br>
and unable to speak or communicate in any way, unable to say, "I've changed
<br>
my mind!"; he hears his death being planned. So rare are pontine strokes
they <br>
that only a few have been recorded to medical records. The doctors did not
know <br>
what to do.  He was—effectively—entombed within his body. He struggled and
<br>
he fought and he demanded, to live. However, as we have seen in the Terri
<br>
Schiavo case, the legal ramifications of ones choice—or no choice—are
numerous, <br>
exhaustive, and complex. <br>
<br>
Regardless of your political position or "feeling" about "right to
life"<br> 
issues, living wills, or the court's role in the cases of the
incapacitated, <br>
Locked In To Life will leave you wondering if you are right, or wrong.
Locked In To <br>
Life will challenge your perception of the living will and how we determine
<br>
that choice.<br>
<br>
If you are considering signing a living will, and think you would like to
<br>
have the "plug pulled" if incapacitated, Locked In To Life is required
reading <br>
before you sign your name. If you are thinking of signing a living will,
and <br>
don't want to have the "plug pulled" if incapacitated, Locked In To Life is
<br>
required reading before you sign your name.<br> 
<br>
Regardless of how you feel before reading Locked In To Life, and the <br>
ferocious conversations you may have afterward with friends and family,
Locked In To<br> 
Life will demand a deeper, thought provoking consideration. Professionals
<br>
consider Locked In To Life to essential reading in their career
considerations.<br>
<br>
 With the recent deaths of Terri Schiavo and the Pope, many people are <br>
considering end of life issues for the first time. Questions include: How
and under <br>
what circumstances would I want to be kept alive should I suffer a <br>
catastrophic accident or illness? What instructions should I give my loved
ones in the <br>
event I lose my ability to communicate?<br>
<br>
These are difficult questions. But we can all learn from the experiences of
<br>
celebrated author, Dr. James Hall, a man who suffered a rare and
devastating <br>
type of stroke that left him fully conscious but completely paralyzed --
except <br>
for the ability to blink one eye.<br>
<br>
Entombed within his own body, unable to speak, Dr. Hall went through a
long, <br>
agonizing journey of discovery, and eventually decided that he wanted to
live <br>
-- despite earlier instructions that he not be kept alive with medical <br>
assistance. He struggled for years to express his wishes, and then to share
his <br>
experiences and insights with others. The result is one of the most
remarkable <br>
books you will ever read:  Locked In To Life. <br>
<br>
The very famous Dr. Mehmet Oz recommends Locked In To Life saying: <br>
"James Hall teaches us how he lost his body, but found his heart. Hall's
<br>
mind-body disconnection freed him to discover profound truths that he
elegantly <br>
shares with his readers. Hall's challenge to find his body is an epiphany
for <br>
all who search for the essence of humanity."—Dr. Mehmet Oz, Complementary
Care <br>
Unit of New York City's Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and author of
<br>
Healing from the Heart: A Leading Surgeon Combines Eastern and Western
Traditions <br>
to Create the Medicine of the Future<br>
<br>
 "One of the most astonishing medical stories of the 20th Century ... Hall
<br>
teaches us that life and consciousness are precious and that the human
spirit <br>
can overcome obstacles most of us can scarcely imagine.  Anyone reading
this <br>
book will be humbled and inspired."<br>
 Larry Dossey, MD, author of "Healing the Body, Reinventing Medicine, and
<br>
Healing Words"<br>
 <br>
Locked In To Life-- the title comes from "locked-in syndrome," the term
<br>
describing Dr.Hall's condition -- is a book you'll remember forever.
Frightening, <br>
inspiring, brutally honest and ultimately triumphant, reading it as a
life-changing <br>
experience.<br>
<br>
If you, anyone in your family, or your friends, is wrestling with questions
<br>
involving quality of life, the right to die, living wills, and government
<br>
involvement in end of life issues, you owe it to yourself to read this
powerful, <br>
intensely moving book which will challenge and enrich you on this
topic.<br><br>
