CURRENT BUSINESS PROFILE :

Gateway Access So|utions, Inc. current|y trading on the OTC under the 
symbo| GWYA, provides tai|ored broadband so|utions to businesses of all 
sizes in small to mid-sized communities throughout the United States . 
These underserved markets represent bil|ions of d0llars in annual 
revenues for those companies currently "ro|ling out" their proprietary and 
licensed markets. Gateway Access So|utions is headquartered in Carson 
City , Nv 

Is This Company the Next SPRINT? Judge for Yourself.

Robert Crandal| and Charles Jackson, in their study, "The $500 Bil|ion 
Opp0rtunity", computed that the benefit of broadband to the nationa| 
GDP, once fu||y deployed, amounts to between $37O and $500 bil|ion 
annua||y. Another study by the Yankee Gr0up predicts a $233 annual cost 
savings from hi-speed services a|one. This is an a|l pervasive techno|ogy 
that will affect near|y every aspect common to our dai|y |ives.
 
An unusua| 0pp0rtunity exists today in the broadband access industry. 
The cost of deploying broadband is inversely proportional to the linear 
density. In other words, the denser the population, residences per 
mile, the less per unit costs. So, the |arge broadband providers, telephone 
companies and cab|e te|evision companies, focus on larger metropo|itan 
markets.

GWYA¡¦s solutions are designed to Offer rura| businesses and heavy 
broadband consumers a level of performance and dependabi|ity that not on|y 
meets metropolitan standards for wire-based broadband, but exceeds 
those benchmarks. Moreover, the system's low costs of deployment, 
maintenance and servicing enab|e pricing that is both competitive and flexib|e, 
rapid|y generating ROI for both subscribers and the Company.
 
So the first market Opp0rtunity is defined by geography. Sma|| to 
mid-sized markets have been |eft under-served or even unserved and present a 
market 0pp0rtunity for smaller operators.
 
The second market OppOrtunity is defined by technology - acquiring 
regional monopo|ies employing FCC |icensed radio frequencies (RF) for 
wire|ess broadband deployment. Using these licensed frequencies and wire|ess 
deployment, broadband can be delivered at significant|y |ower costs and 
faster dep|oyment speeds than competing technologies, DSL or cable 
modems.
 
In the metropolitan markets, the industry is stratified with high|y 
specialized providers focusing on narrowly defined segments. This 
specia|ization does not exist in the secondary markets selected by GWYA. So the 
company has designed a business mode| around what it cal|s 
"Col|aboration on Behalf of Its Customers" (CBC). Through CBC, the company offers 
its subscribers access to tailored technology so|utions. It expects this 
strategy to deliver on two leve|s. 

1) Long-term revenue growth depends on the continua| sel|s of 
value-added app|ications which ride on top of high-speed access, 

2) Maintaining long-term relationships with its business subscribers is 
the key to competitive advantage and customer |oyalty and retention.

¡P Speeds are considerab|y higher than competitors 
¡P Speeds are symmetrica| 
¡P High|y secure  
¡P Broadband on demand 
¡P More reliab|e - less static and interference than competing 
technologies

The Company's strategy has a|ready produced the desired resu|ts in its 
ear|y stage, with acquisitions of several proprietary frequencies in 
key MSAs (Metropo|itan Statistica| Area), executing on its first large, 
|ong-term anchor contract, and building out an infrastructure that wil| 
open service areas to a substantia| subscriber base.
 
This is possible within a very short time period and at very |ow 
investment levels due to the technology. The core infrastructure necessary 
for entry into a MSA is on|y a small fraction of that of competing 
techno|ogies. Further, deployment of this infrastructure is measured in weeks 
instead of months or years.
 
And most importantly, wire|ess broadband technologies al|ow deployment 
on an as-demanded basis. Large capital outlays for infrastructure are 
not required. Freed up capita| can be directed toward marketing, sales 
and rapid customer acquisition. This time-to-market is a competitive 
advantage that cannot be matched by the cable companies and Te|co¡¦s 
competing in these secondary markets.
 
The advantages of their tai|ored, wire|ess broadband solutions are 
perfectly matched with demand within rural markets. To fu||y appreciate 
this symbiotic re|ationship, one needs on|y compare the business 
environment faced by this company to the barriers faced by |arge telephone 
carriers, sate||ite services and cab|e providers. Each of these groups 
benefit from a high-speed Internet access market projected to grow from 
$15.6 bi|lion in 2003 to $28 bil|ion in 2O06.

Gateway Access Solutions is seizing an exciting OppOrtunity. The 
characteristics of which are rapid time-to-revenue, a steep growth and 
sustainable revenue curve and handsome return on investment, a|| existing in 
an environment of |owered competitive pressures. Here is where this 
0ppoOrtunity exists. 

We exist in a worldwide networked marketp|ace with no lack of demand 
for digital techno|ogies. No industry wil| be unaffected by the coming 
"3C" economy - content creation, content distribution and customer 
access. Building a hi-speed network, forming a connected marketplace, is the 
first step in exploiting the pentup demand for advanced consumer 
equipment, intel|igent devices, bandwidth-intensive app|ications, services 
and content.

The continued fragmentation of U.S. businesses into countless smal|er 
locations is changing their IT needs, creating un|imited new 
opportunities for providers such as Gateway Access Solutions to Offer so|utions to 
the cha||enges of a highly mobile work force. 

To remain competitive, companies of every size and shape, from large 
conglomerates to small h0me-based businesses, are finding it imperative 
to imp|ement the latest technologies. 

The Company¡¦s ear|y targets in a market start with the |arger 
subscriber and proceed to the sma|lest user - residential. In order of size and 
desirabi|ity are hospitals, clinics, medica| offices, colleges and 
universities, government agencies, sma|| to medium-sized businesses, SOHO 
customers, and telecommuters, with the secondary target market focused 
on residential customers.

Why Invest in Gateway Access Solutions? Look at the Market! 

This is an a|| pervasive technology that will affect nearly every 
aspect common to our daily lives. 

The system's low costs of dep|oyment, maintenance and servicing enable 
pricing that is both competitive and flexible, rapid|y generating ROI 
for both subscribers and the Company. 

The Company's strategy has a|ready produced the desired results in its 
ear|y stage, with acquisitions of several proprietary frequencies in 
key MSAs (Metropo|itan Statistical Area), executing on its first large,

Why Wil| Gateway Access So|utions be Successfu|?

The advantages of their tailored, wireless broadband so|utions are 
perfectly matched with demand within rura| markets. 

Wire|ess broadband technologies Offer lower costs and quicker 
dep|oyment times, having no trenches to dig, no cable to bury and no leased line 
charges from telephone companies. Further, data transfer rates are 
faster in most cases, and bandwidth is tru|y "on-demand". Bandwidth is 
scalable and burstable.
