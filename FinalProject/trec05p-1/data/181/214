ISAS Members.

Mark Meyer, Chair of the WSCC Operations Committee, has asked me to Chair
the Interchange Scheduling and Accounting Sub-Committee for calendar years
2002 and 2003. I have accepted Mark's request and look forward to working
with all of the talented professionals that comprise the ISAS.

Mark Hackney and I have received several inquiries about the January
14-15/2002 meeting currently shown on the WSCC meeting calendar. I have
elected to reschedule the meeting to February 14-15, 2002 in Phoenix. The
meeting will be sponsored by SRP. We are currently working on the details.
We will make best efforts to provide you hotel and meeting information by no
later than January 10, 2002. We understand that this is somewhat short
notice. However, it is important that we meet prior to the implementation of
E-Tag version 1.7. 

It has become a cliché to state that our industry is going through
incredible change. That has been the case for the last 10 years. However, it
appears that much of the rubber will hit the road over the next 2 years. I
believe that ISAS can and will play an important part in this evolution. We
can help develop the scheduling and business practices that can make the new
environment work for the WSCC. I suggest that our actions should be closely
coordinated with WSCC Operations Committee, the Western Market Interface
Committee, the new Electronic Scheduling Working Group, and the NERC
Interchange Sub-Committee. 

I'll be out of the office on business most of the next few weeks. However,
I'll be checking my E-Mail and voice mail. If there are specific items that
you would like to see on the meeting agenda please let me know. The agenda
will be mailed out on January 17, 2002.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks.
