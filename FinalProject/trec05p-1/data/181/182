<1> 	Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Trader:

A classic example of 'buy the rumor, sell the fact' was seen 
Friday when Crude Oil futures sold off on confirmation of OPEC
production cuts.  Natural Gas, boosted by winter chills, was
the only energy market to close on the upside.  Sentiment in
Grains and Oilseeds was influenced by a decline in Soybeans,
affected by South American weather patterns, the Argentina
crisis and the Pakistan-India tensions.  A bumper Brazilian
crop kept the lid on Coffee, a late surge in Cocoa ran out
of steam, Cotton ended lower on weak US consumption data,
while Sugar rebounded on short-covering.  A drop in lease
rates took Silver down, Gold went nowhere, while Copper took
a late hit.  Cattle was firm and Bellies pumped up.
Equities got a boost from improving consumer sentiment,
while in Foreign Exchange the Yen staged a rally.

Dear Trader:

Everybody always told me that I would have to work very 
hard to make a lot of money. 

But now I make up to $10,000 - and more - in a single day. 
That's when I push myself and put in more than an hour or 
two. Most days I feel more like playing than working, and 
with all the cash THE MONEY MIRACLE has brought me, 
I can indulge myself! 

My name is George Angell, and I was once an unemployed taxi 
driver, with just a few dollar bills between me and the 
poor house.

Announcing my latest trading course that reveals 
EVERYTHING you need to know about futures and options 
- and make lots of money trading them!

The strategies I'll show you let you start small, win big, 
and never risk more than you want to put on the table. You 
could quadruple your money each year, without a lot of 
drudgery and anxiety. 

And . . . my students agree that THE MONEY MIRACLE 
is easy to understand!
