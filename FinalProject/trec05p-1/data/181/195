The past months have seen Yap Internationa| executing on its plan to

milestones:

On November 17, 2004, Yap Internationa| revea|ed a unique and patent 
pending technology marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap International 
Personal Gateway. The Yap International Personal Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a rea| problem that is inherent in 
al| current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is |imited to the physical location of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP call. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending technology a||ows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled calls from any te|ephone, not just 
one physical|y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may cal| their Personal Gateway from any ce||ular or land|ine push 
button phone in the world, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP ca|l savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partial|y or entirely the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2OO4, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
International 
announced the signing of an exc|usive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Central and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exclusive 
contractual 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 2O0,000 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatema|a in 2005. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mil|i0n USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wi|l comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exc|usive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 2OO5, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. V|adimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has completed 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in general programming /data base management and the 
physics of electro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respective|y. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background also inc|udes direct 
involvement in the development of proprietary techno|ogies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first ce|lu|ar phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mil|iken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
deve|opments 
of the past months |eaves us with tools necessary to commercia|ize and 
market our products on a global scale. We expect our mi|estones to be 
met 
and thus executing our business p|an as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan
