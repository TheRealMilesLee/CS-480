Wealth Partners Presents a Special Program for Ex-Enron Employees, entitled

Transitions: Your Job, Your Career, Your Family, Your Finances
Keeping it all together, through the change.

Four Dynamic Experts will address several of the key issues that are
important to you, right now, during a period of transition.

    Kathie Nordt, president of I-focus, a technical recruiting firm,
will discuss how to market yourself in the new tight market environment.

    John Elder, creator of a grass-roots investment program to develop
abandoned research begun by Enron, will discuss the metaphor of "gold in
abandoned mines."

    Kimber Seal, Ph.D. in psychology, will discuss the very human
element of anxiety presented during transitions, and how to keep the family
harmonious during this time.

    Bill Dendy, Certified Financial Planner, will discuss personal
finances during transition; your choices, challenges, and opportunities.
