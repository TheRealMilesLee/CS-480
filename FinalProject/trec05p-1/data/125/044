As we discussed, attached is the final form of the merger agreement with the related disclosure schedules.  The Merger Agreement will be filed with the SEC.  The disclosure schedules will not become public documents.  As such, please do not redistribute the disclosure schedules.  I would appreciate your informing me of anyone else you feel needs to see the disclosure schedules, as opposed to a specific reference in any particular disclosure schedule.  When discussing any particular exception in the disclosure schedules, please pass on the confidential nature of the disclosure schedules.  Thank you.  Lance.
