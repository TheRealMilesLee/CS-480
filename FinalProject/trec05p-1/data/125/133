Hi Greg,

This email is meant to help you during this time of transition from
EnronOnline to Dynegy.

Since you are swamped these days, we here at AGENCY.COM wanted to make a
brief contact with you as you transition EnronOnline to Dynegy and offer our
assistance and expertise as we have particular knowledge of the systems for
the online trading environment.

AS you may know, we designed and built the EnronOnline system for the
Philippe Bibi organization under the guidance of Louise Kitchen for the
business processes and launched it in Oct. 1999.

We congratulate you on the succeess you have enjoyed with the system.  And,
we are still here and would very much like to work with you and the new team
as you transition EnronOnline to DynegyOnline.

I am the executive who put together this original deal with Louise &
Philippe and know the history which could prove advantageos to your team.
As we are located in Dallas, I can be in Houston to meet with you as
appropriate.   Please let us know if you have any interest in our assistance
and domain expertise.

I look forward to your resonse and to meeting you soon.

Sincerly,

~Madelon
