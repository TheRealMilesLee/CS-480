John, I'm responding to an RFP that asks the question, "Describe the provisions for handling scheduled and unscheduled facility shutdowns, both load and generation.  Include how a put to the grid will be accommodated.

Jeff references you in his response.  How do I respond to this?  They have 56 MW generation (40MW gas turbine and a 16MW steam turbine).

Additional question to be addressed in the S&L Cogen proposal re: scheduling a put onto the grid....

I asked our Client Rep @ ERCOT how this is to be addressed...

There way that I see this being done:

Simply generate the Mwhs & NOT schedule but collect from PURPA the strike price IN ADDITION TO the balancing energy price due to the Resource Imbalance (unscheduled Mwh flow). Realize that there are possible Resource Imbalance (RI=generating over or under the scheduled amount) penalties for doing this.

There may be other options but we need to discuss with John Forney, our RT Manager (and part of the Services Group) before offering to do so.

JM

There are no special provisions for handling PURPA Puts in ERCOT.  Power
that flows onto the system has to be scheduled by a QSE.  I understand
the problems this causes for a QSE since PURPA Puts are not a
"guaranteed constant flow" but they were given no special provisions in
the Protocols.

Mark,

How are PURPA puts handled with regard to ERCOT scheduling?  Is there
anywhere in the protocol where this is addressed?
