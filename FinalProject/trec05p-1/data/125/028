John -

What are we intending to get from them that would not relate to an EOL transaction?  If we believe we will discuss other matters than EOL with them, them I do not have a problem being a bit broad; however, if it is only EOL, then we should be specific.

Let me know your thoughts.

Mark

Mark

Caminus took out reference to EOL.   Would this be too broad?   How can we accommodate their wishes below?

Our attorney was fine with the NDA except that by restricting it to
information about the Enron On Line website, it would not cover material
which Caminus might disclose to you in that meeting.

Here it is back with a simple change to make it symmetric
