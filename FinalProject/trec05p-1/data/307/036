                        first products developed by the Company address the 
                        ground meat consumption habits of millions of consumers 
                        who have some level of concern about the possible

                        fat-free and heart healthy soy protein.&nbsp; The resulting 
                        products offer the nutritional benefits of “veggie 
                        burgers” but with the taste and texture of real meat.&nbsp; 
                        These are the first meat products to carry the soy 
                        cardiovascular claim:&nbsp; “25 grams of soy protein a day as 
                        part of a diet low in fat and cholesterol may reduce the 
                        risk of heart disease.”</span></p>

                        over 10 months, the Company made a strategic decision to 
                        withdraw from the market, and to reenter later as a

        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Natural Harmony’s 
        competitors produce either all-meat based or all vegetarian based 
        products.&nbsp; The Company believes this has created a gap in the market for 
        consumers who enjoy the taste and texture of real meat, but want lower 
        fat and are aware of the healthful benefits of soy.&nbsp; Natural Harmony 
        products represent a whole new category of products with this blending.&nbsp; 
        Consumer research and Natural Harmony’s experience confirm that 
        consumers want healthier versions of familiar foods, which require 
        little or no taste sacrifice.&nbsp; The Company’s strategy is to: a) Focus on 
        major trends: Interest in healthier versions of familiar foods, which 
        require little or no taste sacrifice, b) Create a new category: A hybrid 
        of meat and soy, which has the taste and texture of the meat with the 
        health attributes of soy protein, c) Create memorable brand names and 
        become the leaders of this new category of foods, d) Preempt competitive 
        entry with the timely development and introduction of an array of new 
        products.</span></p>

                    information contained herein, the statements on this website
                    and newsletter are forward-looking statements that are made
                    pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private
                    Securities Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements
                    involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may
                    cause a company's actual results in the future periods to
                    differ materially from forecasted results. These risks and
                    uncertainties include, among other things, product price
                    volatility, product demand, market competition and risk
                    inherent in the companies operations. You can identify these
