All dogmas perish the thinking mind, especially ones you agree with.  
Freedom and indedendence form my character.       
There is no such thing as fun for the whole family.  
Opinion is ultimately determined by the feelings, and not by the intellect. 
I never vote for anyone; I always vote against.
