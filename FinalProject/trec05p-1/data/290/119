<p>Dear User,</p>
<p>As part of our security measures, we regularly screen activity in the<br>
  PayPal system. We recently noticed the following issue on your account: </p>
<p>We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an<br>
  unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account<br>
  is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account<br>
  features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please<br>
  understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection.</p>
<p> For your protection, we have limited access to your account until<br>
  additional security measures can be completed. We apologize for any<br>
  inconvenience this may cause.</p>
<p>Please log in to PayPal to restore your account access as soon as possible:<br>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you log in, you will be provided with steps to return your<br>
  account to regular standing. We appreciate your understanding as we work to<br>
  ensure account safety.</p>
<p>In accordance with PayPal\'s User Agreement, your account access will remain<br>
  limited until the issue has been resolved. Unfortunately, if access to your<br>
  account remains limited for an extended period of time, it may result in<br>
  further limitations or eventual account closure. We encourage you to log in<br>
  to your PayPal account as soon as possible to help avoid this. </p>
<p>To review your account and some or all of the information that PayPal used<br>
  to make its decision to limit your account access, please visit the<br>
  Resolution Center. If, after reviewing your account information, you seek<br>
  further clarification regarding your account access, please contact PayPal<br>
  by visiting the Help Center and clicking &quot;Contact Us&quot;.<br>
  We thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please understand<br>
  that this is a security measure intended to help protect you and your<br>
  account. We apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
  PayPal Account Review Department</p>
