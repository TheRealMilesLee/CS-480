I am the Personal Attorney to Mr. James Arnold  a national of your country,who used to work with Chevron company in Nigeria.On the 21st of April 2000, my client, his wife And their three children were involved in a car accident along Sagbama Express Road.

All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost there lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful.After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet, to locate any member of his family but of no avail, hence I contacted you since you are from same country. 

I have contacted you to assist in repartrating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confisicated or declared unserviceable by the National Bank PLC where this huge deposits were lodged. articularly,the National Bank PLC where the deceased had a valued at about US$9 Million dollars has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confisicated .

since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over 4 years now I seek your conscent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you are from the same country  so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$9 million dollars can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money. 55% to me and 40% to you,while 5% has been earmarked to reimburse all expenses that may occure during this transaction.

All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this dealt. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.Please get in touch with me as soon as possible indicating your intrest in this transaction via email.
