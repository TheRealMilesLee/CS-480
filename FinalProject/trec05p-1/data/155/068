Hi,

Received your email, thanks for writing me back.  Don't worry I can deal with sarcasm, I just didn't want to include everything as a "turn on" or people would think something was wrong with me.
And as far as the "No Extremist" goes, I really was at a lost for a title and came up with that last minute.  So, now that I've defended my bio, let me knit pick yours, just kidding.  

I'm betting that with "Travelling Chick" as your title you must either travel a lot for work or really enjoy traveling, or both.  I travel a lot in my job, but it seems to come and go in spurts.  Right now we are gearing down for the Holidays, as well as other reasons, and I don't have any trips planned.  

I read your profile, do you really do all those things; hiking, biking, etc?
When do you get your rest?  Why Vail's chair 10, is that where you blew out your knee, and can you still ski?  Tired of all these questions?  One more than I'll let you go.  What pets do you currently have that you would have to disclose at a later date?  

Talk to you later!
Paul
