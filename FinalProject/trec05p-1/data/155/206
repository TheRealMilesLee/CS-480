Hello,

Thanks for the email.  I'll try and answer some of your questions.  I've only been using this servic since last weekend, and so far it's been a kick.  I think as long as you use it for amusement it stays fun.  I don't know really, if it starts getting weird I'll just turn it off.

I live up in Broomfield and work downtown.  I really haven't found anything worthwhile up in our area.  I spend most of my spare time downtown and elsewhere.

We'll have to meet for a drink sometime and all show you around the city!

Paul
