Mr. Lay,

It seems to have become fashionable to bash you and the other executives as things have become challenging at Enron.  I just wanted to let you know that there are some people who still care about Enron and are still thankful for what you have done over the past 15 years.  I have been completely distraught at the speed with which my coworkers have thrown in the towel and have essentially given up.  I urge you to continue to fight for Enron.  True, it may take another 15 years to get back to a leading company, but do not give up the fight.  You have made Enron a wonderful place to work and I know that Enron will survive.  It would be a tragedy if the innovative thinking made famous by Enron were to be discarded and corporate America returned to a status quo mentality.

I have been informed that I am on the list of those to be laid off because I am in a non-core business, and I agree.  I loved having the job, but desperate times call for desperate measures and I understand the need to focus.  I am tired of my fellow coworkers quitting, complaining, and giving up.  There are plenty of people that will join you in the fight, I hope that you are able to weed out the quitters and get a group of people together who will fight for the Enron way of doing business.  

I applaud you for your accomplishments over the past 15 years in building an incredible company - a company that will survive, a company that will once again thrive, and a company that will prosper well into the future.

Good luck and please don't give up,
Zach Streight
