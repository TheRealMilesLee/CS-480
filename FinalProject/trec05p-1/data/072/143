SWISS Pharm INT is a healthcare company with a uniquely broad spectrum of innovative solutions. <br>
For more than 5 years, we have been active in the discovery, development, manufacture and<br>
marketing of novel healthcare solutions. Our products and services address prevention, diagnosis and<br>
treatment of diseases, thus enhancing well-being and quality of life.<br>
<br>
We have reached big sales volume of pharmaceuticals in central ASIA and now we are trying to<br>
penetrate the USA and European market.<br>
Our focus is not just the diagnosis and treatment of manifest disease. The integrated<br>
healthcare approach is increasingly offering ways of identifying and targeting diseases early, when their <br>
damaging effects can still be prevented.<br>
Arranged in two operative divisions, our global mission today and tomorrow is to create<br>
exceptional added value in healthcare. These two units are:<br>
<br>
Pharmaceuticals.<br>
Diagnostics.<br>
<br>
SWISS Pharm INT aims to supply products and services that significantly improve people's lives<br>
by helping to prevent, diagnose and treat disease.<br>
SWISS Pharm INT is committed to a system of corporate governance that conforms to the latest<br>
standards and takes due account of our corporate development. The safety and health of our employees <br>
and the public, as well as the protection of our neighbourhoods and the environment, have high priority <br>
at all Group facilities. In all we do, we are guided by the principle of sustainable development.<br>
<br>
SWISS Pharm INT pioneering approach to healthcare innovation enables us to deliver significant<br>
benefits to patients as well as to healthcare providers and systems. In our vision of the future, <br>
therapies will be available for many of today's untreatable diseases, it will be possible to optimize <br>
drug efficacy and safety, and effective strategies will be in place for preventing disease. Early diagnosis <br>
and improved new treatments will significantly reduce the need for expensive surgical operations and <br>
long hospital stays.<br>
<br>
While this vision is an aspiration for the future, SWISS Pharm INT has begun pioneering the<br>
path, with a wide range of products and services available to:<br>
<br><br>

-provide health information that can be acted upon to prevent or delay the onset of illness<br>
-diagnose disease<br>
-treat numerous diseases and conditions<br>
-monitor the progress of therapy<br>
<br>
Advancing our understanding of how diseases develop and helping people to stay healthy longer<br>
are among the greatest challenges currently facing medical scientists and healthcare providers. <br>
In this, both our businesses can make a difference by bringing high quality diagnostic and<br>
treatment options to the market. The divisions concentrate in gaining an understanding how <br>
diseases develop and play a pivotal role in todays healthcare.<br>
