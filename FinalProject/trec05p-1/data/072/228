Hi Harry,

Thanks a lot for your help.
IOU big time buddy !!

Can you send me whenever you have time,
the titles, etc. of these people on
the email list,
or let me know where I can get it myself.

As suggested by Suresh, I emailed him 
my current resume. He was planning on me
coming in and meeting 6-7 EES people.

I am also attaching my updated resume for your
records.

Talk to you soon. We are anyway visiting
Houston this weekend for Kavita's baby shower.
and will see you then.

cheers,

Gurmeet
