Lindy,
Thank you for such a beautiful birthday message.
I am just on my way to bed, but I will write back
and answer all of your questions.  Unfortunately,
I was sick all weekend, including my birthday,
and I am still not 100%, but I wanted you to know
I received your lovely message. I will be writing
back soon.  Take care.  I love you!!! Margy
