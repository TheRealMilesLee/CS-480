Michelle -

We are struggling with the appropriate company identifier for business cards.  We are employees of Enron America, however some of our business cards show Enron North America (carryover from days of old), EWS (no longer/or will no longer exist), and some show Enron Corp (International Admin group).

Marge Nadasky in Corp Public Relations who deals with the Company logo and Company names on business cards, etc., has indicated that Legal prefers we use the operating company we are part of rather than Enron Corp (piercing the corporate umbrella issue).  She did say we could use just plain Enron if we are not part of the corporate group.  

As part of a network services function which crosses all Enron business units, do you see any problems if we use Enron on business cards?  We have several who have changed positions or never had cards and need new ones.


Thanks


Sheila
