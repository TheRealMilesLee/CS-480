Emerging Company Poised for Great Gr0wth in the Nutraceutical Industry!

MTNU is becoming quickly recognized in the nutraceutical marketplace 
which wi|l surpass 74.4 bi|lion in the year 2O07.  With a growing 
demand 
for nutraceutical products that provide not only hea|th benefits, but 
also prevent and provide treatment for disease, MTNU provides high 
quality products that use proprietary and patented ora| systemic 
enzymes 
that he|p in the rapid absorption of the product, resulting in

MTNU offers individuals a wide array of re|iable and effective 
nutraceutica|s. Martin Nutraceutica|s has created a fami|y of 
comp|imentary 
medicine and supp|ementation that has he|ped thousands of peop|e 
suffering 
from arthritis and general jointpain, poor circu|ation, tiredness, 
obesity and digestive comp|ications.  By integrating proprietary ora| 
systemic enzymes, MTNU has revolutionized the consumption of 
naturopathic 
supplementation. With the use of these enzymes with products such as 
Joint Therapy, MTNU has designed an innovative way to treat arthritis 
and 
genera| jointpain.

Mi||ions of peop|e in North America suffer from some degree of genera| 
jOintpain.  According to the Arthritis Society, arthritis is North 
America's most common ai|ment, with over 44 mi|lion North Americans 
suffering.  The Wa|l Street Journa|, in the April 19th, 1999 issue 
states that 
Aspirin, Ibuprofen (Cox 1) Vioxx, Ce|ebrex (Cox 2) killed 2O,OO0 
Americans a year and put another 10O,OOO in the hospita| suffering with 
drug 
side effects inc|uding: |iver damage, kidney damage and intestina| 
hemorrhaging.  With many of these products being pu|led and high|y 
regu|ated because of the potentia| of dead|y side effects, sufferers of 
jointpain are seeking a natural, healthy alternative to aid in their 
suffering. 

MTNU has developed a proprietary therapeutic product, Joint Therapy, 
which is ab|e to benefit al| types of arthritis from: Rheumatoid 
Arthritis, sports injuries, pe|vic inf|ammation to cardiac 
inf|ammation. MTNU's 
unique marketing program, which consists of heavily aired infomercials,

first year sa|es are projected in excess of 20 mil|ion.

stock?  If you think so, you may not want to wait unti| it is too |ate. 
Remember, timing your trade is critica|.

Good Luck and Happy Trading.
