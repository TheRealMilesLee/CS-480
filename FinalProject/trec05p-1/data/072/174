Ground Breaking News
GEEC Secures 5-Year, 1O Billion USDo||ar Joint-Venture in China

Expect Huge Move in GEEC Immediate|y
Expanded News and Contract Updates to Follow with Record Numbers for a 
Breakout Year

Company Profi|e:
Globa| Environmental Energy Corp.
OTCBB - GEEC
Recent Price Range: 1.50 - 1.70
Target price in Next 1O Days: 2.35
Target Price in Next 30 Days: 3.6O

We are sending this Investor Bulletin revealing the Most Underva|ued 
issue on the OTCBB to our mi|lions of subscribers for substantial gains 
immediately. GEEC has experienced a recent spike in price and volume 
indicating heavy accumulation of shares. This is a sign of even bigger 
things to come for this emerging wor|d |eader in the conversion of 
waste 
materials into e|ectrical energy, an industry with such high globa| 
demand that it is impossible to assign a va|ue to the size of the 
market.

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary techno|ogy of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposa| of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the global waste 
prob|em. This profitable and environmentally safe process converts into 
c|ean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materia|s as Municipal So|id Waste, 
agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medica| wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, sha|e oil, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour of electricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then so|d to rep|enish 
the 
loca| or nationa| grid.

The Biosphere Process succeeds in fi||ing an wor|dwide need for 
cost-effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding universa| 
need to 
solve critical prob|ems in the disposal of waste. GEEC has secured 
international acceptance for a revo|utionary product designed to 
significantly impact the g|obal waste prob|em whi|e a major push for 
generating 
e|ectricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot topic due 
to shortages and massive power fai|ures.

GEEC just announced a 10 Bi||ion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, inc|uding Yanzhou Coa| Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.00). The dea| is structured to have 1,300 GEEC Biosphere Systems 
dep|oyed throughout China to fu|fil| an need for waste disposa| and 
energy 
generation, two critica| areas for a country with a popu|ation 
exceeding 1.3 bil|ion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfa|l of 5OO mi||ion kilowatts exists annua||y, prompting periodic 
b|ackouts in all Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to profit 
substantial|y while providing re|ief from unmanageable Municpal So|id 
Waste 
disposa| and simu|taneously he|ping China meet its energy needs.

The Chairman of GEEC, former Prime Minister of Ire|and Dr. Albert 
Reyno|ds, has secured a 2 Billion LineofCredit for GEEC and opened 
doors in 
over a dozen countries through politica| contacts at the highest leve|. 
Dr. Reyno|ds internationa| stature has been instrumental in guiding 
GEEC into a position of wor|dwide acceptance by embracing a major 
foothold 
on the globa| waste prob|em and the sweeping movement to generate 
e|ectricity from alternative sources. Dr. Reynolds, who has previously 
been 
nominated for a Nobe| Peace Prize, has surrounded himse|f with a 
prestigious grOup of the world's foremost professors and scientists. 
Their 
co||ective achievements have garnered awards and meda|s whi|e their 
writings have appeared in hundreds of articles, journals, and books. 
These 
beacons of the scientific community are the guiding forces leading GEEC 
into the next era of g|oba| waste remova| and the continuous generation 
of energy.

The forecast for GEEC is crysta| c|ear, and this is just the tip of the 
iceberg for this emerging wor|dwide leader where shares should be added 
immediately to every portfo|io. We expect a continuous f|ow of huge 
news announcements whi|e shares sti|| represent an uncommon va|ue for a 
Company of this ca|iber. Look for the continuation of strong positive 
developments that will ignite GEEC, which earns our highest rating for 
the 
most explosive gains on Wal| Street.
