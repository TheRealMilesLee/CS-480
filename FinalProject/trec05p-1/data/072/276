Thersa,
Can you send me your revisions with the discounted price and commodity
charges applied to the planned storage injections today or tomorrow?  I
really need that ASAP to see if our numbers are getting any closer.  
I believe that the fuel calculations are being taken into account for the
planned storage injections for the whole path from CIG through WIC and into
Young Storage.  I was planning on calling you after I saw your revisions.


Thanks...Robert
