The following is a summary of the claims filed by Enron against PG&E.  Please note that this summary does not reflect any of the claims filed by Portland General, which would also add to Enron's "total."

<<Enron Claims.ppt>> 
Please direct any questions to Michael Tribolet, or myself. 

Thanks, 
Bryan
