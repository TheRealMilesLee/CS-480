Assalam Allaikum. From: Ms.Hendrina A. Khan
Email: hendrinakhan@fastermail.com
Dear 

May the peace of Our most Beneficient and Merciful
Allah be with you. 

I am Ms. Hendrina A. Khan, a Nationality of Dutch
South African and the wife of Dr. Khan Abdul Quader, a
native of Pakistan Nationality and a Renowned Nuclear
Scientist. 

All, I require from you in regards to my contacting
you at this point in time is honesty and sincerity to
assist me make claims of some funds, my husband's did
deposited in Abroad, as
other deposits documents have been confiscated and
seized by his government. 

But, this particular,one is the only one they could
not source out, as I did kept the documents with one
of my close confidant, who was also arrested. The
Amount being deposited is much about US$56,500,000.00
(Fifty-Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars Only), as this was the money that was
supposed to be for him, as part of his consultancy fee
for the transfer of scientific technologies. 

And this money has been lodged with a Financial and
Security Organisation, abroad by his associates, in my
personal details. My husband has recently been removed
and arrested from his post as the Scientific Adviser
to the Pakistani Prime Minister. And, because, of
this, he has given me the go ahead and source for
someone, who is not a family friend nor his associates
to make claim of this deposits, on my behalf and
invest it.

I will look for a way out and sneaked out of Pakistan
and travel down to meet you, so we can go into a life
time Joint venture Partnership together, in investing
this money in your country and anywhere else you
prefer. 

Regards,
