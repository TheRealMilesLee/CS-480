Dear Friend,
 
PLEASE TREAT AS ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENTIAL
 My name is Frank Nigel, I am one of the Senior Managers in the bank I  w=
ork
for (Union Bank, Nigeria PLC) and I work under the Director of  Foreign E=
xchange
Operations (International Remittance). 

I am  contacting you presently because I need your urgent assistance in a=

 business transaction that will be of immense benefit to both of us.  I h=
ave
the immediate need to transfer some money that has long been  declared "U=
NCLAIMED"
by the chairman and some members of  the board of directors of our bank.
The money is the closing balance  of one of our best customers ever, Late=

Engr.ASWARD FORSTER,I was his
 personal account officer just before he died in the ADC plane crash  of
1996 in Nigeria. Engr. ASWARD FORSTER an American citizen was a  contract=
or
with the Federal Government of Nigeria, he supplied and
 installed equipment and his company Richland Contractors completed  some=

of the best construction contracts in the country. His closing  balance i=
n
the bank, Union Bank of Nigeria PLC (US$18.5Million)
  has been tagged unclaimed because no relative of Engr.ASWARD has come 
forward to make a statement of claim. We have no knowledge of a next  of
kin.
 
At this point I trust you can picture what the situation is like. We  hav=
e
strong proof that the chairman and the board of directors will  keep most=

of the money for themselves and donate the remainder to a
 discredited military trust here in Nigeria. This invariably is an  attem=
pt
to infuse more money into the acquisition of military  equipment (arms an=
d
ammunition) for use in an already prostrate  Africa. This of course, is s=
enseless,
hence my mission. My colleagues  and my self have made several attempts a=
t
locating persons that could  be remotely related to Engr. ASWARD and we h=
ave
been doing this for  about 4 years now. Right now I am almost alone in th=
is
enterprise and  I have presently decided on moving the money to a foreign=

account.

 I am hereby soliciting your assistance and I will be very grateful if  y=
ou
will be willing to help in this regard. We have access to most of  what i=
t
will take to transfer the money. The only thing we do not  have is a safe=

account. We will provide you with answers to all the  security questions,=

which you will have to answer to move the process  towards  ompletion. We=

will also provide you answers to questions  that only a person related to=

him will know. You may however not need  to make any appearance, every th=
ing
will be concluded on phone and  fax between you and the bank [UNION BANK
NIGERIA PLC, LAGOS]  for your participation you will get 15%, 5% has been=

earmarked for the  expenses that may be incurred on both ends. 80% shall
be for my colleague and I. I make  this proposal in trust and in good fai=
th.
 
therefore, if you are interested and you agree to assist me then  contact=

me immediately , and send your banking details phone and fax  number,ther=
e
is a lot more to talk about. If you are not interested,
 then, please, do get rid of this email and please forgive me if this  me=
ssage
has upset you in any way.
 
Thank you and best regards.
 
Frank Nigel
