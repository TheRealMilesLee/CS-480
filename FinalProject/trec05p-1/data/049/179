Members of the Haas Community:

We are all saddened by yesterday's tragic events. This is likely to have 
personal ramifications for colleagues, friends, and families with close 
connections to the Haas School of Business and UC Berkeley.

Everyone is naturally eager to find out whether anyone from the extended 
Haas community has been affected. A website has been put up and is being 
used by many business schools to provide information in light of this 
national tragedy.  The address is http://www.finebrand.com/statuses. The 
site posts status reports of individuals by school and by class year. We 
encourage you to help update this information. Please note, however, that 
the School is not able, at this early stage, to confirm the accuracy of the 
information posted on this site.

Thank you for helping to alert the Haas community about those who may be in 
need of support. This is a sad time for our community and our nation.  As 
Associate Dean Ben Hermalin counseled us yesterday, we must recognize that 
many people will be severely affected by what has happened, and that they 
require our sympathy, understanding, and support.
