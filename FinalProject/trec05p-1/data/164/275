To:      December 2001 Graduates
From: The Evening MBA Program Office 
 
We in the Evening MBA Program Office would like to take this opportunity
to officially congratulate you on your completion of the MBA Program.
We're proud to have you as alumni and know that you will go forward with
the same enthusiasm, drive and success that you have had in the Evening
MBA Program.
 
The following is a list of important upcoming events and general
information: 
 
Commencement 
The commencement ceremony will be held on Sunday, May 26 at 9:00A.M. in
the Greek Theatre (you may invite as many people as you'd like to the
ceremony).  We invite December 2001 and May 2002 graduates to
participate in this ceremony.
 
We plan to mail a commencement packet to your home address in March.
Included you'll find information on the ceremony, caps and gowns,
champagne reception tickets (minimal charge for more than 2 guests), and
a commencement speaker voting ballot.
 
Commencement information is available at the Haas Alumni Network at:
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/alumni/newgrads/evmba.html
 
Diplomas
Your diploma will be ready in the Registrar's Office, 120 Sproul Hall,
about four to six months after you graduate.  It can be picked up
without charge.  The Registrar's Office will not give it to the Evening
MBA Program Office. You can have it mailed to you for a modest fee.  For
more information please refer to:
http://registrar.berkeley.edu/Records/transdipl.html
 
Party!
Our annual Evening & Weekend MBA Program End-of-Year Reception will be
in May, a celebration for everyone!  All students, graduates and
families are welcome.  Invitations will be sent in April. 
 
Auditing Classes
After you graduate you may be interested in auditing classes.  A week
before classes begin, please contact the Evening and Weekend MBA office
to find out if there are seats available.  Then, with the approval of
the instructor, alums are able to audit classes for $500 per course plus
the cost of books and readers, available in the office. Since there is
no formal audit status at UC Berkeley, the class will not show up on
grade sheets.
 
University Bills
You will likely continue to receive bills from the University after you
graduate regarding Spring 2002 semester.  Please ignore them.
 
Evening News
We will continue to e-mail you copies of The Evening News for the next
year, as you may be interested in the activities of your classmates.
 
Activities
If you are interested in participating as alums in any of these
activities, please let us know:
 
- interviewing applicants
- speaking at or attending Open Houses
- participating in panel discussions (career changes, etc.)
- arranging for speakers for the EWMBA Speaker Series
- planning for alumni events
