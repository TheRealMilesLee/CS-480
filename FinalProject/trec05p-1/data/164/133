                              comparison, the New York Stock Exchange would 
                              require approximately two months of trading volume

                              growth may be attributed to globalization, 
                              economic measures that integrated national

                              <p>The growth of electronic trading in the 
                              currency markets is rapidly changing one of the 
                              last unregulated financial markets and banks are 
                              losing their traditional dominance. Until 
                              recently, consolidation in the overall banking 
                              industry was expected to reduce the number of 
                              players and further concentrate liquidity and 
                              price-making power in fewer banking hands. These 
                              developments were seen as symptoms of a maturing 
                              market and limiting future growth potential. But 
                              the opposite has taken place. Groups such as 
                              Hotspot FX, GFT Forex and Currenex, offer access 
                              to the foreign exchange market, contributing to 
                              increasing price transparency. Some even rival the 
                              banks in terms of attainable leverage. With new 
                              providers, the barriers to entry into the foreign 
                              exchange market have been reduced and numerous 
                              hedge funds and trading advisers are taking 
                              advantage of the opportunities created by the 
                              non-bank entities. While there has been 
                              consolidation on the banks' side, a number of 
                              different business models are thriving in the

                    profile published by OTC Live, Inc is an independent
                    electronic publication providing information and factual
                    analysis on selected companies. All statements and
                    expressions are the opinion of OTC Live, Inc and are not
                    meant to be either investment advice or a solicitation or
                    recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. Investing
                    in micro-cap securities is highly speculative and carries an
                    extremely high degree of risk. OTC Live, Inc is not a
                    registered investment advisor or a broker dealer. It is
                    possible that an investor's investment may be lost or
                    impaired due to the speculative nature of the companies
                    profiled. Profiles rely on information provided by the
                    featured Companies and/or Edgar filings. While OTC Live, Inc

                    Readers should not rely solely on the information contained

                    respect to any investment opportunity, including any
                    contemplated investment in the advertised Company. </span>

                    FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: Except for historical
                    information contained herein, the statements on this website
                    and newsletter are forward-looking statements that are made
                    pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private
                    Securities Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements
                    involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may
                    cause a company's actual results in the future periods to
                    differ materially from forecasted results. These risks and
                    uncertainties include, among other things, product price
                    volatility, product demand, market competition and risk
                    inherent in the companies operations. You can identify these
                    statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to
                    historical or current facts. They use words such as

                    "suggest", ``believe,'' and other words and terms
                    of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of
                    future operating or financial performance.</span><font face="Arial"><o:p>

                    solely on what you read in an online newsletter or Internet
                    bulletin board, especially if the investment involves a
