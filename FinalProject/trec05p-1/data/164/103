Bill--pls prepare unanimous consent papers withdrawing the board resolution we did on TW approving the bankruptcy filing.  We'll get the papers in front of Stan, Rod and Dan soon and then we'll do a new board meeting in January (or whenever) if a decision to take TW into Ch. 11 becomes appropriate.  I'll let Weil know that the TW board will need a fresh briefing on the situation before bankruptcy is approved.  Thanks.  Good idea Danny.  DF
