 Sir, 
I am a lady accountant with a bank here in London. There is a fixed 
deposit of £150,000,000.00 (One Hundred and Fifty Million Pounds 
Starling) made to this bank since 1994 which ten years now and since 
then no claim or withdrawal have been made on that deposit. 
Fortunately, I have been the person working the interest from the day 
of deposit to date. The interesting part of it is that the fixed 
deposit belongs to the late Nigerian dictator General Sani Abacha, 
this means that the account may have been abandoned by the surviving 
family members or that they are not even aware of the existence of the 
deposit. However, I just finished updating the interest of the deposit 
this January, and it has come up to £105,000,000.00 at the 7% interest 
rate per annum. It is this interest that I am interested in because I 
know very well that the family will care less on what happens to the 
interest if they want to redeem the deposit, they will be interested 
on the main money, that is if they are able to claim it at all because 
all the money lodged into different banks here in Europe and United 
States are now been claimed by the Nigerian government. 
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3333557.stm Meanwhile, my plan 
is to withdraw just some amount from the accumulated interest, which 
will not even affect the main fixed deposit. I will give you the 
details of procedure and my full ID when I receive your reply and 
indication of partner. Your reward and amount to withdraw will be our 
mutual agreement to avoid any misunderstanding. We have nothing to 
lose, we only need courage to do this. Sincerely yours,

 Miss. NB: I decided to contact a stranger for this deal because of 
the saying that your best friend could be your worst enemy. 
regards


 cynthia wood
