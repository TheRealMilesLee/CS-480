Chris -Can we get these deals fixed (delete the triggers) so they can be reversed (corrected) in Unify?  We have April-02 out on A/R all ready, but May-02 is still in draft status (we have not closed the accrual/accounting month change in Unify for ENA).

The sooner the better.  Please let me know.

Thanks  WRP

I don't think the triggers are correct.

Ed, this brings up a good question that may already be addressed. Both of the Midland deals still show up in the trading system.  Should they be terminated effective 6/1/2002?  One of the Midland deals (MCV 2, deals #340305 and 332163) was put in Sitara with triggers.  We stopped serving MCV 2 effective 4/1/2002.  These triggers will continue to create an invoice each month unless we change the deal in Sitara.

Please check into deals 332163 and 340305 for sales invoices to Midland Cogen.  Max Doner thought these deals would not trigger activity anymore per your note to him on 5/13.  I see where these deals were updated by you on that date.  Are the deals legit, or are the triggers generated legit.  Please let me know ASAP.

Thanks  WRP
