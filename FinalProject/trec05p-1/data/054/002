Kim:

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

Thanks.
