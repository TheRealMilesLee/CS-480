Tracy,
I need to know what the consolidated to Enron numbers are for ETS, PGG, and the other portions of Stan's world (if material), accrual-wise.  I'm not so concerned with the cash, but the EBIT impact bottom line to ENE.  Also, I need to know what part has been accrued YTD and how much more will be accrued in the 4th Q.
Thanks

Approximately $19mm related to bonuses.  However, that is not all consolidated to Enron.  This is cash payout not accural.  This is for ETS only.

Hello everyone.  Management has begun to look toward the 4th quarter and is requesting certain information from each business unit.  

I need to know, by 10:30am Wednesday:

	a. Total bonus accrual for 2001
	b. Amount of bonus accrual that is (or will be) accrued YTD through September 2001
	c. Amount remaining to be accrued in 4th Qtr 2001

Additionally, each CAO* has been asked to compile a list of potential hurdles/challenges/clean-up items for the 4th Qtr. that will be discussed at an offsite this week.  You may want to touch base with them and make sure they are aware of this and come prepared.  I have sent a reminder message to them today also.

Thanks,
Steve


*with the exception of EGEP  (Jim call me if you want to discuss)


PS - Faith and Tracy - I'm assuming you guys will coordinate for wholesale and stan's world respectively.  If you'd like me to contact any group directly, let me know.
