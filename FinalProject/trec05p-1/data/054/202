Grumbling makes the loaf no larger. 



Laziness travels so slowly that poverty soon overtakes it. . Don't cross the bridge till you come to it. . Curses, like chickens come home to roost. . One man's loss, is another man's gain. .
A burden in the bush is worth two in the hand. 

It is the first step that is difficult. 

no more?

A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. . Never put off 'til tomorrow what you can do today. . Two cannot fall out if one does not choose. .
Don't cross the bridge till you come to it. . It's a poor job that can't carry one boss. . A good thing is all the sweeter when won with pain. .

Call a spade a spade. . It's an old dog for a hard road. . Not in a month of Sundays. .
