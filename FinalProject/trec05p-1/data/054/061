I'm hearing that ERCOT is backing off from ever invoking a fee for the REC program.   If you recall, ERCOT was going to take up this issue again at the end of year -- after initially suspending invoking any fees.  With the REC program up and going, ERCOT has determined that the fees to operate the program are not as high as initially projected.  We're hearing that in January they will likely permanently roll all the fees associated with running the REC program in with the overall market administration fees.   This is good news.
 
We need to keep a close eye on the transmission, though.  If there are transmission constraints and congestion getting the wind power from West Texas, this will likely bump up the cost.
