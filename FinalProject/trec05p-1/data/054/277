Gerald,

The Upstream group is doing a considerable amount of repeat business with several customers. There is an increasing need to execute Master agreements with these customers. 

We would like to begin the development of a Master Wellhead contract that includes the same type of provisions that our Upstream GTC contracts include such as tolerances, keep whole, nomination deadlines, etc. Can you please let me know if you see any issues with changing the Master Firm contract to accomodate the Upstream business or if there is anything else that you may need from us to begin creating this Upstream Master?

Thanks,
Judy
