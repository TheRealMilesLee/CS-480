No life can be dreary when work is a delight. 



A little body doth often harbour a great soul. . Different strokes for different folks. . He who laughs last, laughs longest. . If you lie down with dogs, you'll get up with fleas. .
Never let the sun go down on your anger. 

The fool wanders, the wise man travels. 

no more?

Absence makes the fond heart wander. . Cheerfulness smooths the road of life. . If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. .
Fax is stranger than fiction. . Don't blow your own trumpet. . Fax is stranger than fiction. .

What's the good of home, if you are never in it? . The early bird gets the worm. . Hasty judgements are generally faulty. .
