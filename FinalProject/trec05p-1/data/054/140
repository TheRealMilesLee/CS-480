I was in a car accident in Hawaii and hurt my lower back (the braking
leg side). For some crazy reason I've also been nauseous almost all of
the time last couple weeks. It is very weird. My back is not bad but the
doctors say it could get much worse if I am not careful over the next
couple of weeks. They were adamant that I shouldn't ride this weekend.
It is such a bummer. I am sorry you couldn't make it either. I hope you
have a fun trip to So. Cal. I can imagine that you miss riding very much
but I know you will have horses back in your life more once things calm
down a bit. 

Are you still living on Dolores? What do you think of the neighborhood?
Rob and I have been ratified on an offer at 3991 20th. It is far from a
done deal yet but we are excited. Will I be close to you? 
Big Hugs,
Madeleine

Sweetie, what happened?  How'd you hurt your back?  So sorry.  And SO
sorry that this isn't working out for anyone.  I really wanted to see
you guys and REALLY wanted to ride.  Another day, I guess.  Take care of
that back.  Herniated disks are bad, so take care.

Best,
Jeff

Hey gang-
Just back from the doctors and he said "do not go riding this weekend".
I am terribly disappointed but it wouldn't be wise. I don't have any
broken bones and it doesn't appear that I have a herniated disk--at this
point just a lumbar strain but he is afraid it will get worse if I ride.
I am sorry for the inconvenience and I will send Lari a separate email.
I hope the trip is wonderful. Please share the details.
Madeleine

Hi all,

Sorry that some of you won't be making it to Mendocino.  I talked to
Lari's
assistant Cynthia and they are not planning to exact cancellation
charges.
Cal and I are still planning an all-day ride on Saturday, and Pat and
Nora
will be joining us on Sunday for a four-hour beach ride.  Would love for
any
of you who are "on the fence" to join us for both days.  The Ranch would
like to know by Wednesday if possible.

Amy

Dear folks:
Hope all finds you well, given the circumstances.  I would very much
like to go, but I continue to be embroiled in the energy mess and school
has started (last year!).  Turns out I'm going to have to be in Southern
California that Friday and part of Saturday for work.  I'm going to have
to cancel.  If there are any charges, please let me know.  Hope to see
all of you very soon.  Be safe.

Best,
Jeff

that's really too bad, i hope you are still able to make it.  I am still
planning to go, but will definitely be riding only on Sunday and might
drive
up on Saturday instead of on Friday.  Lu, I'll call you after I talk to
Jeff
to confirm whether he's still going.

Hey guys--
It is my hope that you and your loved ones have not been directly
affected in the tragedy.

I assume that the trip to Mendocino is still going forward. I am not
happy to report that my lower back has gotten worse and not better since
the accident in Hawaii. Sadly, I may have to pass on Mendocino. I will
find out more this upcoming week and let you know.

If I do have to cancel I would assume we should keep the Grandma's room
for Jeff & Lu. If there are any potential cancellation charges I should
pay to Lari please let me know. I have been looking forward to this for
so long, I am sad to think of not joining all of you.

I will get back to you by Wednesday.

Madeleine

Hi Group,

Need input for Lari as our ride approaches (Pat can you forward to Lu
and
ask him to reply to me).

I know some of you have ridden with Lari many times, but her scheduler
is
facilitating this process and has asked for some information.  Please
provide the following and I will batch and send to Lari:


Years riding
How often currently riding
type of riding (i.e. English lessons, dressage, trail)
type of saddle preferred
age, height and weight


Also, we initially planned on an all-day ride on Sat, and a four-hour
ride
on Sunday so we could all head back relatively early.  Lari would like
to
know where we want to ride on each day.  Nora is only riding for the
four-hour ride, and prefers the beach.  How about an all-day ride in the
redwoods on Saturday, with a four-hour beach ride on Sunday?


Amy
