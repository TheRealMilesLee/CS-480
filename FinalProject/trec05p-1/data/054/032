Mark - 
Attached is Shonnie's proposed language for triggering the termination of the 4t qtr portion of the executory contract.  We would have this amendment executed and send an invoice to ENA for the 4th qtr payment.  Due to the IPAYIT system we would expect payment to likely be slow.  Can you have G-money review it on your side?
Thanks.  
 
Current thought is to bring forward all of 4th qtr payment through the early termination amendment.  Let me know if this causes you concern.  If you get in a jam, we may be able to find some firm capacity on LC or FU to cover you for the rest of the year (or life of pipe).
