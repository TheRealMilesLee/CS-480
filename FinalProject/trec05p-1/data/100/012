west .Africa my department, the treasury, does transactions that run 
into several hundresds of millions of dollars quaterly. Myself and two 
othercolleagues in thisdepartment are currently in need of a silent 
foreign partner, whoseinfluence and bank account we can use, to 
transfer thesum of twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars 
(US$12,500,000.00) This funds accrued legitimately but discretely to 
us as commission from foreigncontracts through our private 
connections. The funds is presently waiting to be remitted by our 
offshore funds managers to any foreign beneficiary cleared for 
payment. However by virtue of our positions as civil servants in our 
country we cannot acquire this money directly, in our names. We are 
not allowed by the civil service code of conduct to own oR operate 
bank account outside our shores, on the other hand it is not safe for 
us to keep the money here due to ourunstable political environment in 
this part of the world.
I have been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues to look 
for an overseas silent partner in whose account we would transfer the 
us$12,500,000.00 to, for our mutual benefit, hence the reason for this 
email. I am requesting that you assist us as our silent partner and 
receive the funds in your account for uson trust. We propose to share 
as follows, 20% to you as commision and 80 for us. You will be free to 
take your commission immediately the funds hit your account. since our
objective for now is to invest the money, it would be
appreciated if you can also of assistance by advising on short and 
long term investment possibilities your country. Should it not be 
convenient for you to assist with investing, we can end our 
cooperation after you hand over to our percentage of the money. The 
transaction although discrete is legitimate, the money will be 
transferred to your account with all necessary back-up documents 
showing legitimacy and source origin of funds. The transfer will be 
effected within seven working days to be completd. I plead with you on 
one issue, whether you are interested or not please do not expose this
