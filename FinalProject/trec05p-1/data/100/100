Harry - Here is the update that you submitted for last month.  I do not anticipate that there will be too many changes or additions for the November report, but I would like you to look it over just in case.  Would it be possible to meet in the next few days - or even Monday, and discuss any changes or ongoings that I should report to Jim?

 

Thanks,
Bryan
