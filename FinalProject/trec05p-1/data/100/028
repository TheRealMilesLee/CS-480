I NEED YOU TO ACT AS THE NEXT OF KIN TO LATE Mr. MORRIS THOMPSON
----------------------------------------------------------------

I am Miss Azzawi Atiku.

I have decided to contact you for this business proposal based on the mutual
understanding I know that can exist between us, having known that people
of your Country are trustworthy.

I am the manager of United Bank for Africa Plc. (UBA) , Ilupeju branch,
Lagos Nigeria. The intended business is thus; we had a customer, a Foreigner
from (Alaska) resident in Nigeria, he was a Contractor with one of the Government
parastatal. He has in his account in my branch the sum of US$30.5 Million
(Thirty Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S.Dollars) . Unfortunately, the
man lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which
crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only daughter. You shall
read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got during my
investigation;

http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ and

http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.htm

Now we want you (being a foreigner) to be fronted as one of his next of
kin and forward your account and other relevant documents to be advised
to you by us to attest to the Claim. We will use our positions to get all
internal documentations to back up the claims.

The whole procedures will last only 7 working days to get the fund retrieved
successfully without trace even in future. Your response is only what we
are waiting for as we have made all necessary arrengements to move this fund directly
to you through the account you have provided to us.

As soon as this message comes to you kindly get back to me indicating your
interest.Then I will furnish you with the whole procedures to ensure that
this deal is successfully concluded. For your assistance we have agreed to
give you twenty five percent (25%) of the Total sum at the end of the transaction.

It is 100% risk free and a mega fortune. All ! correspondence towards this transaction
will be through Phone Fax email.

I await your earliest response to my private mail box (msazzawi3@yalla.com)

Thanks, Yours Sincerely

Miss Azzawi Atiku.
