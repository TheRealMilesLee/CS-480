	We can not get the cost of funds data until Monday to pull the current PRM balance by counterparty.  We should have the OTC margin analysis through October soon.  We gave it to you yesterday in two pieces, however, we will have it on one report today.  Georganne indicated that you have the Nymex initial margin balances as of yesterday, it was net about $60 million.  We will be receiving @ $25 million today.  We can update that report for today.  Let me know if this is what you need.

Is the rest of the stuff coming and when?

Particularly I am looking for OTC margin analysis with updates (including all counterparties and with October) and also I want to know the actual Nymex balance as off yesterday - I can see cash flows but not the balance.
