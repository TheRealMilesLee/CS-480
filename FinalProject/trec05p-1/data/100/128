Tanya and Jay:

I need someone to please look into the following trades with various Enron entities (other than ENA) identified by Beth Ng of Morgan and whether these were booked incorrectly or should properly be booked in the names of the following affiliates:

Enron Liquids
Enron Reserve Acquisition Corp. (oil option)
EOTT (I think EOTT documents its financial deals separately)

Also, there have been trades for physical settlement, such as, an "oil forward" and a "gas TBP forward".  Maybe Jeff knows the answer to this one.

Thanks.
