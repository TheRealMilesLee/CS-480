Dear Jeff,

How are you doing? I hope everything is all right with you. I just came back from Wharton undergrad interview, it was good, we have very strong candidates, and hopefully we can have them as many as possible. It is a pity that you were not there. 

Will you have time to chat a couple of minutes? I need to figure out my career path at Enron and I really need your help. And I will really appreciate it!

Looking forward to speaking to you!
