Jim, i suggest that the group includes Exelon (Jack Crowley), Constellation (Harvey Reed), Edison Mission Energy (Reem Fahey), Reliant (John Orr), Duke (Mike Gildea or Lee Barrett), Mirant (Jim Mayhew), PG&E (Richard Doying) and Cinergy (Dennis Flaherty).  Some of these parties may not be supportive but would appreciate being contacted (which at least opens up the communications channel for NG).  

I suggest that NG make contact with the executives rather than Enron (we need to continue to hedge our position, the old no fingerprints approach)...

cheers
Mike

Mike --

When you have the list of customers we should contact, please let me know.  I should try and get back with Ashley today.
