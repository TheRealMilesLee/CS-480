BA294.1 Corporate Social Responsibility brings top-notch speakers who will discuss how today's companies deal with increasingly complex issues of social concern, and how their companies cope with the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities arising in this rapidly changing world. 

"As the globalisation debate develops, from the events at Seattle to Davos this year, companies are seeing there is something out there they haven't understood -- that society wants more from business" (Financial Times, 02-02-2001) 

Why does an institution such as UBS Financial Services Group take Corporate Social Responsibility so seriously? 

Want to find out what it is and how to deliver it? Sign up for BA294.1 Corporate Social Responsibility. 



BA294.1 Corporate Social Responsibility 
Thursdays 4-6pm, Spring 2002 
One unit 
Guest lecture series 


How can corporations enhance customer value and build competitive advantage through social responsibility? This class will explore current challenges and opportunities facing companies in areas of corporate social responsibility. Through discussions with speakers each week we will examine and evaluate contemporary trends in corporate responsibility with respect to environmental protection, community development, employee welfare etc. and relate these elements to their business strategy and business opportunities. 

The speaker schedule is not yet finalized, but it will be comparable to last years schedule. Past speakers have included Paul Rice (Transfair USA), Ray Anderson (Interface), Amory Lovins (Rocky Mountain Institute), David Olsen (Patagonia), Paul Dolan (Fetzer Vineyards), George Zimmer (Men's Warehouse), Amanda Tucker (Nike), Geoffrey Ashton (Calvert Investment Funds), Thomas W. Van Dyck (US Bancorp Piper Jaffray), and Gail Brownell (Agilent).

"Sustainability has become a crucial success factor in business. Moving proactively to meet future economic, environmental and social challenges is increasingly seen as an important lever to increase long-term shareholder value." (STOXX Limited's Managing Director Scott Stark)
