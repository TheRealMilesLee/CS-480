Tana/Mark,
Columbia Gulf has requested the following changes to their NDA. The legal entity name should read "Columbia Gulf Transmission Company."  They would also like to add point number 9 which states, " The execution of this agreement relative to confidential information does not obligate either party to enter into any other agreement or any transaction as that term is referenced herein."

As long as you don't have any issues with the changes, please forward a copy to Jim Hart at Columbia.  They are scheduled to come over for a demo next week.

Thanks,

Dan
