i think we're getting 2 meetings confused (my fault).  mike, would you set up a PG&E/SCE coordination meeting (my assistant is sick today)?  anytime except 2-3 or 4-5 is good for me.

i think we've sent a markup to SCE.  i am available today and agree it would be a good idea to meet.  BTW are you available for a call today at 2 CST to discuss strategy for the mon meet and confer with SCE?

Bob --

Where do we stand on the SCE stipulation?  I want to make sure that our push in SCE doesn't conflict or contradict something we are doing in the PG&E discussions.

Can we meet today?

Jim
