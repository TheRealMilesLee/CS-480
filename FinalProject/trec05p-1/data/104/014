In the second version I eliminated the market share cap for affiliates (it is something we wanted to claim in Arg since we knew nobody would respect any rule of conduct). 
Bob Frank ask me if he could have more time to read the original paper to add his comments. You decide if we wait.

Guillermo --

I should sign the letter.  Also, we should be consistent on affiliates given EPMI and Enron Gas Mktg.  We are affiliates of a pipeline.  We offer competitive services on the affiliated pipelines.  Let's be consistent with our own business.

When are you going to send the letter?

Jim

Attached is a first draft of comments to CAEM about the Disco of the future document to discuss in our 4pm meeting.
The idea is to comment just the top 5 issues.
Regards,
Guillermo
