EAS reviewed a sample of invoices with company codes altered by the end user prior to coding and approval to ensure that the original invoice dates were maintained.  Our testing showed that the fix was effective and the invoice date did not change after October 10, 2001.  Several other issues were uncovered and are described in the draft report.

Attached please find the draft report detailing the results of our testing. I will contact some of you next week to discuss the recommendations.

Feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns regarding this draft report.  

Thank you
