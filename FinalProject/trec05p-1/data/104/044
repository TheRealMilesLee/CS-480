This course will offer a hands-on review of the activities that occur on the 8th workday for general ledger close.  Specific topics that will be covered include:
	Printing trial balances out of SAP
	Developing an accrual template
	Reviewing DARS adjustments in TIS
	Creating an Other Adjustment in TIS
	Reviewing the voucher
	Executing certain ad hoc queries
	Reviewing tax and book roll-up information
	Tieing out TIS to SAP

This training course will be in the Training Room (EB1702), so the participants will actually perform each of the activities listed above.  Who should attend?  All parties that are directly involved with preparing income tax accruals utilizing TIS are encouraged to attend.  

As usual, all three classes will cover identical materials, so attendance is only necessary at one class.  Since this is a hands-on class, each class will be limited to 20 with the more-experienced users watching and assisting the newer users.  

A majority of the analysts that will be attending this training course will be out of the office the week of November 5 for the CPA exam.  If you are certified already or will be in the office on Nov 6, please sign up for that course if at all possible leaving spaces in the other 2 classes for analysts that will be out for the exam.

Please sign up through the October and November training calendar on the tax web page at  http://tax.enron.com/.
