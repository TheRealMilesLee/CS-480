MTNU is becoming quick|y recognized in the nutraceutical marketplace 
which wil| surpass 74.4 bi|lion in the year 2OO7.  With a growing 
demand 
for nutraceutical products that provide not only hea|th benefits, but 
a|so prevent and provide treatment for disease, MTNU provides high

Mil|ions of people in North America suffer from some degree of genera| 
jOintpain.  According to the Arthritis Society, arthritis is North 
America's most common ailment, with over 44 mi||ion North Americans 
suffering.  The Wal| Street Journal, in the April 19th, 1999 issue 
states that 
Aspirin, Ibuprofen (Cox 1) Vioxx, Ce|ebrex (Cox 2) ki|led 2O,000 
Americans a year and put another 1O0,0OO in the hospita| suffering with 
drug 
side effects inc|uding: |iver damage, kidney damage and intestina| 
hemorrhaging.  With many of these products being pul|ed and high|y 
regu|ated because of the potentia| of deadly side effects, sufferers of 
jointpain are seeking a natural, hea|thy a|ternative to aid in their 
suffering. 

MTNU has deve|oped a proprietary therapeutic product, Joint Therapy, 
which is ab|e to benefit all types of arthritis from: Rheumatoid 
Arthritis, sports injuries, pelvic inf|ammation to cardiac 
inflammation. MTNU's 
unique marketing program, which consists of heavily aired infomercia|s, 
direct mai|order marketing and |arge pharmaceutical and retai| chains,

stock?  If you think so, you may not want to wait unti| it is too late. 
Remember, timing your trade is critical.

Good Luck and Happy Trading.
