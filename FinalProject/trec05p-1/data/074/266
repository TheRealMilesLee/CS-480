Just a quick question while I remember, as you know I am giving an overview of the DASH process and the Legal Risk Memo that must accompany any DASH.
My understanding is that the Legal Risk Memo must be attached to the DASH when the DASH is circulated and that on the face of the DASH form prepared by RAC, we should not be and there should not appear any Legal Risk assessment, which must only be contained in the Legal Risk Memo. The DASH should simply refer to "See attached Legal Risk Memo".
	
I am hoping that this is also how you like to see the process work in practice.

In addition I am going to say that if possible you need to be briefed and receive a draft of the Legal Risk Memo before it is circulated with the DASH.
	
See you shortly.
