Here's my attempt.  No reference books or web searches were used in the preparation of this email.  Afterward I researched it and found out how miserable I did.  Here is the link.  Kamp, it looks like there might be two for the 1B category as well.  Sorry you didn't make it.

Hope you're all doing well!  GO YANKS!!

There has been an MVP who reveived the award two years in a row at each position (center field has two), including at pitcher.  Name them.  

I will share the answers in a future email.  I'm thinking Bert or DiLeo are the only ones who have half a chance at this one.  Prove me wrong.

Pitcher :[Claffey, Jim] Roger Clemens

Catcher:[Claffey, Jim] Yogi Berra (this is a lock)

First Base: (no it was not Rich Kampmann)[Claffey, Jim] I was gonna guess you!  How about Gehrig? Carew?

Second Base:[Claffey, Jim]   I haven't a clue but will stab at Joe Morgan (only because I liked that thing he did with his armpit when he batted.  My brothers and I learned to make the farting noise with our arms from him!

Third Base:[Claffey, Jim] Mike Schmidt (No doubt about this one)

Short Stop:[Claffey, Jim] Robin Yount?

Left Field:[Claffey, Jim] Mickey Mantle 

Center Field:[Claffey, Jim] Joe Dimaggio and Dale Murphy (I had help on Murphy from some Braves fans)

Right Field:[Claffey, Jim] Roger Maris ?
