Elliott this is a great initial product description. Can we expand this to include the blended  products (incorporating existing renewable resources and/or non-Green-e certified) and is it reasonable to begin to put notional pricing behind these products?

Here's a first shot at a product description for RECs with the type of layout I thought might work. Please send suggestions. Richard, clearly we have some work to do on pricing. Also, what are the logical geographical divisions? Do you agree with my NERC region distinction?
