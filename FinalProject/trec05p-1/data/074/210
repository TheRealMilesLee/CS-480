Hi Richard,

I like this - can you let me know where we are with delivering this initiative. I would like the initiative to combine all business units if possible.

Thanks

Sally & Mark,
	Attached below is the executive summary for Beth's project management initiative. I would be happy to discuss this effort in more detail if you like. There is several deliverables to the organization before the end of year to help with monitoring and consistency of projects across ENA/EGM/EIM. Also, EES, ETS, and EEL have been in discussions as to our direction and timing and the solutions they currently have in place.

Richard

I've prepared the attached presentation for your review as sponsors of the Project Management Focus Group effort.  It is an overview of our initiative with high-level status and schedule information.

I will schedule a more detailed status update meeting within the next 2 weeks.  

Please call with any questions you may have.
