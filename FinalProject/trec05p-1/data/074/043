Dear Sir,
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for
me, because, I believe everyone will die someday.
 
My name is  Tariq Alotaiba Ahmed, a merchant in Dubai,
in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal
cancer which was discovered very late, due to my
laxity in carrying for my health. It has defiled all
forms of medicine, and right now I have only about a
few months to live, according to medical experts.
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I
never really cared for anyone not even myself but my
business. Though I am very rich, I was never
generous, I was always hostile to people and only
focus on my business as that was the only thing I
cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know
that there is more to life than just wanting to have
or make all the money in the world.
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come
to this world I would live my life a different way
from how I have lived it. Now that God ! has called
me, I have willed and given most of my properties
and assets to my immediate and extended family
members and as well as a few close friends.
I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul
and so, I have decided to give alms to charity
organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed
money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E,
Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any
more. I once asked members of my family to close one
of my accounts and distribute the money which I have
there to charity organization in Bulgaria and
Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to
themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as
they seem not to be contended with what I have left
for them.
The last of my money which no one knows of is the
huge cash deposit of twenty four million dollars
that I have with a security company in Amsterdam
Holland.
I will want you to help me collect this deposit and
dispatched it to charity organizations.
I have set aside 20% for you for your time and
patience.
 
God be with you.
 
Tariq Alotaiba Ahmed
