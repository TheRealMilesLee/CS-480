Ken, we are working with a team that is building ethanol plants throughout
the Southeast and the Midwest, and we are in the process of arranging the
right capital partner as well as identifying the right strategic partner for
that endeavor. The other players in this ambitious project have
relationships into Enron, but I thought that you might be able to shove me
in the right direction of the person to talk to there.

I hope all is well with you, and one day when you are in the DC area and
have nothing better to do you will let me have the opportunity to visit over
dinner and reflect on how many years it has been since you and we created
the Natural Gas Clearing House. We are having a lot of fun putting together
large private equity deals and you might find that aspect of what we do as
possibly interesting as well. We have expanded into the energy and utilities
space as telecomm and technology have had their share of problems. In any
event, would appreciate the input and look forward to a visit in the not too
distant future. Best regards, Tom
