                            PROPOSAL FOR URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE


ATTN: My name is Mrs Monica Malani, the first wife of Mr. David Malani of 
Zimbabwe. This might be a surprise to you about where I got your contact 
address. I got your address from the South African Chamber of Commerce 
through internet in Johannesburg, South Africa. During the current war 
against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the supports of our President Robert 
Mugabe to claim all the white-owned farms to his party members and his 
followers, he ordered all white farmers to surrender all their farms to his 
party members and his followers.


My Husband is one of the best farmers in our country, and the President to 
the Famers associations in Zimbabuwe. And because he did not support 
Mugabe's ideas, Mugabe's supporters invaded my Husband farm and burnt 
everything in the farm,and killed my Husband and made away with a lot of 
items in my Husbands farm. Before his death, my Husband had deposited with 
one of the Security Company in Johannesburg, South Africa the sum of US$ 
18.5 Million Dollars(Eighteen million five hundred Thousand united state 
Dollars).


After the death of my Husband, we decided to move to the Republic of South 
Africa where he had deposited the money in the Security Company as a family 
valuables. So I decided to contact overseas firm and companies that will 
assist me to move this money out of South Africa because as asylum seekers 
we are not allowed to operate any bank account within South Africa, even to 
do any business is not allowed.


We have agreed to offer you 30% of the total sum for your assistance, 5% 
will be mapped out for any expenses that may be incurred in the course of 
this transaction and 65% will be for me and my family to invest in you 
country. All I want you to do is to furnish me with your direct phone and 
fax numbers for easy communication. your home and work address, and any form 
of your identification, like drivers licence or photocopy of your 
international passport.
Note that this transaction is legit, and 100% risk-free and it requiers, 
absolutely confidential.You can contact me through my son Joseph with His 
direct number+ 27-73-153-6545.


Reagard,


Mrs Monica Malani.
