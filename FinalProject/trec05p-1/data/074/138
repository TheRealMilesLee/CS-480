Jenny,
 
We have a main Renewable Power Desk folder on the O Drive (O:Portland/WestDesk/Renewable Power Desk). Since we all have access to the O Drive, I would prefer to store all of our info there. I have created a new folder called Shared in which we can store our Competitive Analysis and other files.
 
Howe does that sound?
Elliot

All - 
 
You should all now have access to a shared folder in the O drive.  Together with the internal competitive analysis web site we are developing, we can use this to keep files we all need access to.  
 
Check it out - 
 
O:\StateGovAffairs\Renewables
 
Let me know if you have any problems accessing this.
 
Jenny
