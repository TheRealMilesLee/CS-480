Not so impressed with David goldman.  For a guy who has worked in derivatives for 10 years, couldnt answer some simple questions.  Very poor financial derivatives knowledge even though he worked at CRT for a long time and a Lyonnais for a while.  The only value I see in him is that he worked at BP for a while and might have some knowledge as to how they work.
