Paul,

RE: Dashboard	 Here is you id/password for the dashboard.

RE: Pipeline profile You will have to push Java WebStart to your PC.  To do so go to windows Start , Programs, JavaWebStart, and click on the Java Logo (looks like the one below).  If you do not find Java WebStart or encounter other problems please call.
