The movers will be packing all Forest Products and Steel files, reports, magazines, etc, on Thursday.  If anyone has any books, files, newsletters, etc, that are from the filing cabinets or research area, please either return them to their home before Thursday or drop them off at my desk (EB 2999e), so that we can account for everything with the move over to the new building.
 
Admins - if you could check the desk areas of those people away this week, we would greatly appreciate it.
 
 
Thanks,
Avril
