Attached is a brief for you to forward on to the State Department.  There have been numerous press articles on the transaction since it was announced and I will forward several for your reference.  We will continue to let the British government take the lead on this (good to know that State agrees with this strategy).  Call me to discuss the brief at 713/853-6973
