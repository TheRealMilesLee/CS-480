We are discussing this posting on not including shipper data and will be back in touch.  Glen is cooridnating the discussions as they reflect information from prior meetings.  At this time, we don't want to update any posting.  We'll be back in touch.  MK

	Wanted to be sure you were both in the loop that we are NOT posting Shipper
	imbalances to the Web, only OBA Dollar Valued agreements.  If you have any
	questions, please let me know.  This was decided after a meeting this morning
	with Shelley and Teb to review TW tariff and compliance.  Thanks. Lynn

Please review the attached draft on the TW posting for trading imbalances.
The data is not real imbalance data.I wanted to get a draft out since Glen would be out of the office until Thursday.
Please make any changes to the document & return to me by COB Wednesday, 9/12/01. I will then send a revised final draft out on Thursday and Richard will send the imblance posting document to Toby on Friday afternoon for posting.

Thanks Ramona
