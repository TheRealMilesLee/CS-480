Don't be so touchy!  I was only teasing. BTW, I tried to call you Sunday but you never left me your number. I left you 2 messages at work. Actually it was you who blew me off, thanks a lot. ; )

I'm off to Virginia late this morning so I may not see you. 

You are done on double or nothing, but I thought the bet was $20. I'm just a lowly originator, I can't afford big trader bets!

And my name automatically comes in at the bottom of a message.
