Sheila/John

In reference to the discussion on Wednesday, I wanted to provide more information concerning the Secretary of the Army's Civilian Aide Program.  As I mentioned last Friday I received a call from Tom White's office indicating his intention to nominate me to be a Civilian Aide for Texas.  

This is an honorary position (protocol equivalency of a Major General).  Each state normally has one person serving in the capacity of a civilian advisor to the Secretary of the Army.  Large states like Texas, New York, California, Florida may have two representatives.  Generally the Civilian Aide  may be asked to represent the Secretary at functions within the state or to work with active duty installations, such as Ft Hood, on matters impacting the civilian interface with the Army.  It also could involve activities associated with reserve and national guard components within the state.

It is my understanding it may require being out of the office 6 to 8 days a year in addition to several functions in the evening or on the week end or meetings at the Pentagon or Ft Sam Houston.  I do not believe this would conflict with Enron's interest or work requirements.  In fact may bring some positive recognition to the Company in having a person serve in this capacity.  There is no compensation paid for the service but I understand the Army reimburses for travel related expenses.  It is not a political position but one designated for community/business leaders within a given state.

I trust this will be acceptable to Enron.  Perhaps, it could be viewed somewhat similar to a person being in the National Guard or Army Reserve.

Please let me know if you need any more information.

Randy
