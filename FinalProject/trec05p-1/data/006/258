Mark, I left you a message on Friday regarding the Riser Agreement that the Enron Networks business folks are anxious to put into place.  I understand that you will be out of town until Wednesday.  Is there anyone else on your staff that I could work with to get this fairly simple document reviewed and approved?  Many thanks.
