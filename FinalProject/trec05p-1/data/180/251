Dear Senator Dorgan, 

           Why Is Government Protecting The Real Thieves?   The sale of counterfeit securities is the vehicle for blatant thievery of Enron and other securities! 

           Evidence Of Counterfeiting:   The fact that short sold receipts are never issued by the represented public company; in simple terms, this means they are bogus, counterfeit receipts representing shares of legitimate stocks or bonds.   Falsified publicly reported data then helps to conceal the malicious scam. 

           Who Is Behind This Counterfeiting Operation:   How it's done, why it's done, and those protecting it may surprise many.   Remember, when the Public is buying the Thieves are selling opposite the public while often holding price down to sell even more ... especially when legitimate shares are not available. 

           Deliberately Engineered   economic hard times and bankruptcies are sure to follow.   The Thieves are not going to buy back their bogus receipts in a legitimate market ... they're protected and the laws are ignored as they share illicit fortunes via secret unaudited omnibus accounts.   It's all in US Congressional reports. 

           For More Information Start Here:
