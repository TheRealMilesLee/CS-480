 Strategic Research Institute Presents:
  
LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS
Economics & Technology Summit
  January 28 - 29, 2002 w Renaissance Houston w Houston, TX
 
www.srinstitute.com/CR210 <http://www.srinstitute.com/CR210>
 
Make the Right Investments in the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Industry by Learning the Latest Developments in:
    
  wTerminals      wTechnology            wRegulations      wTransportation
  wEconomics     wDistribution Plans   wTrends             wProduction Facilities  
 
    Within the next decade, LNG will become one of the most reliable energy sources for
    the United States. The opportunities for LNG continue to grow, as illustrated by 
    recent plans to extract 12 Tcf of natural gas from Alaska as early as 2002. As a 
    result of similar discoveries in Australia and other neighboring countries there has 
    been an increase in proposed receiving terminals in the United States. You will hear 
    first hand from current and future terminal owners along with why there is a rush to 
    build LNG carriers. 
 
    Due to the drop in natural gas prices and the United States economic downturn, it is 
    important for you to understand the latest economic issues facing both the LNG 
    and natural gas industries.
