Didn't get anything for this Friday, but here is the flyer for New Years.



Organizers of the first" National Orgasm Week" held this year were very
disappointed with the results obtained.
It seems at least three quarters of the women polled just pretended to
celebrate it.


  Everyone loves champagne during the Holiday season! Do we have a present
for you !!!!!! Compliments of Korbel. When you come to Marlowe's New Year's
Eve after work between 4:00 and 6:00 and bring two friends, you will receive
a complimentary half bottle of the bubbly. If you bring in 4 friends you
will  recieve a full bottle .Be sure to invite everyone. The more the
merrier.

  For us fans of "Sex In The City", new episodes start January 5th. Yeah !!

 Please bring your e-mail in and present it to the server or bartender.
Looking forward to seeing you. Happy New Year!


Liza
