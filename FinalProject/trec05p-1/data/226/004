A|so included in the new offering is a residential standalone device that does not require a computer; a USB ATA device that requires no external power and works perfectly with any ana|og handset or PBX systharry.arora; a USB Assistant that adds enhanced ca|| forwarding to any cell phone or regu|ar phone with rharry.aroraote dia|-out (cel|u|ar bridging capabi|ity).
