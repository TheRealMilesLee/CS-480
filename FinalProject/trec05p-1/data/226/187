NNG:
Carlton Resolution continued at 75%
The SOL for Sunday February 10th was pulled.

TW/FGT:
The MOPS outage looks like it will continue through this week due to weather prohibiting the divers from being able to work on the leaks. Approximately 100,000 a day will be cut during this outage. 

There were no significant system issues reported to me this weekend and I received no calls from Reps needing assistance.
