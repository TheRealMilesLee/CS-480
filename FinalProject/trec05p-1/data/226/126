Q,

I think I'm going to sweat to death.  It's rainy here and sooooo muggy.
I've done everything wrong in my battle to control jet lag.  I took a short
nap yesterday about 2:00 pm.  I didn't wake up until 7:00 that night.
Needless to say, I did not sleep well last night.  As a result, I'll
struggle to keep my head from crashing thru my computer monitor this
afternoon.  I have not had a chance to look around Jakarta yet, but it is a
huge city.  Our office here is on the 18th / top floor and has a commanding
view of the city.  Jakarta has quite a few tall buildings, but they are
spread out around the city.  Quite a contrast to Houston's skyline.

Is your Sister coming next weekend?  I hope so, as it will be nice for you
to see your sister.

Time to get back to work.  I want you to know that I miss you and I promise
to hurry home.

Love Kim
