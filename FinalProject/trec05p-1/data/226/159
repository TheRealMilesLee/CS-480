We will see record numbers of new powerplants coming on line this year. New, much larger RTOs promise dramatic increases in liquidity. The Enron fallout will continue to force balance sheet improvements-- perhaps more mergers and acquisitions. Price volatility will continue, and risk management techniques will continue to be honed.

TRANSMISSION AND RTOS
Representatives from PJM, Cal ISO and Midwest ISO on their respective regions. 

INSURANCE
Scott Ettien from NCM, Lynda Clemmons from Element Re and Pat Toner Goudarzi
