Hunt Oil Commissions Study for Camisea LNG Project

 

    A subsidiary of Hunt Oil, Camisea LNG, has selected Kellogg Brown 

& Root, a division of the Halliburton, to conduct a Front End 

Engineering Design study for a LNG liquefaction facility and marine 

terminal on the coast of Peru south of Lima. The $8.5 million study 

is expected to be complete in about 8 months. The facility will be 

near the Camisea natural gas field, which is estimated to contain 13 

Tcf.  Development of the field and construction of a pipeline and 

related facilities to deliver gas to Lima are currently underway and 

are expected to be completed in 2004. If the plant is constructed, 

Peru would become the first country in South America to export LNG, 

with shipments expected by the last quarter of 2006. The FEED 

contract will include studies from the inlet to the LNG facility, 

through the liquefaction process, to the marine LNG loading facility. 

The design study contemplates a one-train liquefaction plant with a 

total production capacity of at least 545 MMcf of gas per day. 

Kellogg Brown & Root will also study and engineer plans for a 

dehydration facility, an acid gas removal facility, and other 

necessary infrastructure. Concurrent with the FEED contract, 

environmental impact assessment for the Camisea LNG export project 

will be conducted.

Most New Single Family Homes Prefer Natural Gas Heat 

 

    About 70% of the single family homes completed in 2000 featured 

natural gas heat, demonstrating consumers' strong preference for the 

efficient, clean-burning fuel, according to the AGA's 2000 

Residential Natural Gas Market Survey. Electric heat was 2nd at 27%, 

followed by heating oil at 3%. Natural gas has been consumers' 

favorite energy for home heating for more than 12 years, because 

customers prefer its comfort, reliability and value.  Along with 

natural gas heating systems,  builders are also including natural gas 

fireplaces, barbecue grills, garage heaters and other amenities in 

new homes to meet consumer demand.  The natural gas share of new 

single-family home completions matched or exceeded the electric share 

in all regions. More than one of every 10 new natural gas residential 

customers in 2000 converted to natural gas from electricity, heating 

oil and other energy sources, the AGA survey reported. In the multi-
family sector, 

natural gas was in 45% of the units completed in 2000, 

up from 43% in 1999. When both single and multi-family units are 

considered, natural gas house-heating market share of new housing 

increased from 64% in 1999 to 65% in 2000. The electric home-heating 

market share dropped from 33% to 32% in 2000. Overall, 59 million 

residential customers, or 61% of total US households, had natural gas 

service in 2000. About 83% of those natural gas customers use natural 

gas for house-heating purposes, representing 51% of total US homes. 

The total number of natural gas residential customers rose by almost 

1 million from 1999 to 2000. 

 

Baker Hughes Weekly Rig Count

 

     The number of rigs searching for oil and natural gas in the US 

fell by 15 to 838 last week, according to Baker Hughes.  There were 

1137 a year ago. The number exploring in Canada was down 13 to 439, 

compared to 565 a year ago. The number of rigs in the Gulf of Mexico 

was up 2 to 116, compared to 161 a year ago. The number searching on 

land was 694, and the number of offshore rigs was 123. There were 21 

inland rigs. The total North American rig count dropped 28 to 1,277, 

compared to 1,702 a year ago. The total searching for oil rose by one 

to 144, and the number searching for natural gas fell by 16 to 693. 

There was one miscellaneous rig, unchanged from last week.
