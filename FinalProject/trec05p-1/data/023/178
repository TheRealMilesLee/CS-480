Dad and I are going up to the dome tomorrow about noon.  We will, of
course,
bring Annie - is there anything else we can do to help you guys?  Should
I
make a Nicoise salad for Saturday?   Friday??  Sloppy Joes??

We will bring eggs, butter, cheese, etc.

I'm going to let the Sheas know too - I'll also let them know that you
will
be up there all week (two shows a night)
