Hey Mike
To install the SO2 Report program just go to O:\Liquids\Liquids\Coal\SO2_Report\Install and run setup.exe.
There is not much to it, just be aware that it takes about 15 min. to generate the report and you should not
cancel it once it has been started.

Wade,

I am a new analyst working under John Massey and Trevor Woods.  Trevor told me to contact you to get the SO2 Model installed on my computer, so I can view it.  

Thanks,
Mike
