FROM Mr MOHAMMED NASSER 
FINANCIAL BANK OF BENIN 
REPUBLIC OF BENIN. 
WEST AFRICA. 

DEAR FRIEND 
I am Mr MOHAMMED NASSER, the director in charge of auditing

and accounting section of Financial Bank of Benin cotonou 
Republic of Benin in West Africa with due respect and 
regard. I have decided to contact you on a business 
transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at 
the end of the transaction . 
During our investigation and auditing in this bank,my 
department came across a very huge sum of money belonging 
to a deceased person who died in (beirut-bound charter jet)

plane crash on the 25th December 2003 here in cotonou 
(replublic of benin) and since his untimely death the funds

has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any 
claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or 
relation before our discovery to this
development.(http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/index.html).

 Although personally, I keep this information secret within

myself and partners to enable the whole plans and idea be 
Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The

said amount was US$24.1M(Twenty Four million One Hundred 
Thousand united states dollars). 
 As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive 
information through my a friends who works with the 
Ministry of Information here in Cotonou-Benin. It is him 
who recommended your person to me to be viable and capable 
to champion a business of such magnitude without any 
problem .Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim 
over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the 
deceased,get the required approval and transfer this money 
to a foreign account has been put in place and directives 
and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as 
you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and

also benefit yourself to this great business opportunity. 
In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my

position in this country as a civil servant,we are not 
allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually 
raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer 
because I work in this bank. 
This is the actual reason why it will require a second 
party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin 
to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he 
will need the money to be re-transferred into on his 
request as it may be after due verification and 
clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where

the whole money will be remitted from to your own 
designated bank account. 
May I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100%

risk free as I have made arrangements for a successful 
arrangement as an insider of the bank before contacting 
you. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be 
entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 
10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may 
arise during the time of transfer and also telephone bills,

while 60% will be for me and my partners. 
Please, you have been adviced to keep this a top secret as 
we are still in service and intend to retire from service 
after we conclude this deal with you. 
I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank 
until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to 
come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the 
fund according to percentages previously indicated and 
further investment, either in your country or any country 
you advice us to invest in. 
All other necessary information will be sent to you on your

acceptance to champion this transaction with me. 
I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible on my 
personal email address.stating your wish in this deal. 
Yours faithfully, 
Mr MOHAMMED NASSER
