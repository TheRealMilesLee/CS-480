PLEASE FORWARD TO YOUR OASIS USERS


All OASIS Users -

We recently discovered erroneous data in the OASIS database effecting the
following reports.  This problem only effected the data reported for the
Hour Ahead and Real-time markets as shown below. Please note that the
Forecasted Transmission data reported for all future operating hours was not
effected by this occurrence -- i.e. all 2-Day Ahead Forecasts and Day Ahead
Forecasts are (and have been) accurately reported.

Tab Location	Report Name			XML Report Name
Market Types Effected 
Transmission 	Available Transmission Capacity	TRNS_ATC		Hr
Ahead & Real-time 
Transmission 	Transmission Allocation Report	TRNS_TAR		Hr
Ahead & Real-time 
Transmission 	Actual Scheduled Flows		TRNS_ACT_SCHED_FLW	Hr
Ahead & Real-time 
Forecasts		Available Transmission Capacity	FCST_ATC
Historical Data Only *
Forecasts		Transmission Usage Report
FCST_TRNS_USAGE	Historical Data Only *

Effective, today August 9, 2001, at 1300 the problem has been resolved and
the system is now reporting correct information.  We have removed the
erroneous historical data back to May 30, 2001 to avoid confusion.
Therefore, data will not be available for the above Transmission reports
prior to 1300 on August 9, 2001. We are currently looking into the
possibility of recreating the historical data, however a schedule for
completion is not available at this time.

* Please Note: You may notice that historical Forecasted data will continue
to be available.  Once the operating hour ends, these forecasted
transmission reports were designed to reflect the final real-time values for
that hour.  However, since the Real-time information is currently not
available, all historical hours within the forecasted transmission reports
from May 30, 2001 through August 9, 2001 will reflect the Day Ahead Final
Information until further notice.  Effective August 9, 2001 at 1300 the
forecasted transmission reports will contain the real-time values for all
historical hours as originally designed.

Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.
