I have not heard back on if you have corrected your reports.  Again I want to clarify that I am not using gross/net reports to prove to you that R112386 has a balance of only $64,720.92, I am using SAP cost center reports.  The only difference between the gross/ret report and the R cost centers is a $196.48 direct charge for computer expense to a FAR order.  This difference is detailed in the spreadsheet I have provided.  Are you still sure my R cost centers are over budget by $26,000?  They sure look under-budget by $23,000 to me.  Please let me know as I would like to submit an expense report.

 Sorry we could not meet.  The problem seems to be Mary lists the total in R 112386 as $114,109.41 while in SAP the total is $64,720.92.  Please see attached.  I don't see how Mary's report could possibly tie to SAP.  Please provide me an SAP report that details $114,109.41 in R112386 because the one I run keeps coming up with $64,720.92.
