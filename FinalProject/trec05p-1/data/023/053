Hi,

Sorry for bothering you, but I am really interested in your opinion on the 
following matter. Recently, there has been a lot of investment scams on 
the web. I have been seeking worthwhile investment opportunities for a 
couple of years now and would very much appreciate it if you shared with 
me the projects you have joined. You can also click on the link below to 
view the project I have invested with: http://www.rogernutt.com

All the communication between you and me will remain fully confidential.

Have a nice day,
Roger Nutt
