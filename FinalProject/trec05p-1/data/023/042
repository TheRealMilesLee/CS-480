				FILENET SYSTEM OUTAGE

				AUGUST 17 - 19, 2001


The FileNET System is scheduled to be down for maintenance to start the upgrade process to IMS 3.5.  This upgrade will be done in several stages, the first stage being the Oracle database.  For this upgrade all batches scanned or imported into queues must be cleared from the FileNET System by Friday, August 17th at noon.  All users will not be able to access the System after close of business on Friday, and we anticipate users having full access on Monday morning August 20th. 

If you have any questions or concerns about this outage, please feel free to call the Help Desk @ 713-853-1555 Option #1
