I am forwarding this message to John Forney.  He is the person that handles this book now.  I have previously given him the information.

Hi Clint,

I am emailing you to find out if you have gotten any information on this counter party for August production on the 400mw and the Sept production for the calculation of the dollars on the 8050mw that we purchased from COA. Please update me on the status at you earliest.

Thank you!!!!!!
