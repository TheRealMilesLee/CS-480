Stacey and Martha,

Clara and I met with Pushkar on Friday.  Take a look at the Proposal discussion and let us know your thoughts.

We are basically suggesting that we treat the front two years as MTM via all normal processes and the back years as a different process.

Thanks. Sheila

Stacey and Martha,
This outlines our discussion yesterday between Stacey, Clara and myself.
I have given to Pushkar today.  We will discuss with him and set  up a meeting next week.
