 Little Amy was in the garden filling in a hole when her neighbor peered over the fence. Interested in what the cheek-faced youngster was doing, he politely asked, "What are you up to there, Amy?" 

 "My goldfish died," replied Amy tearfully, without looking up, "and I've just buried him." 

 The neighbor was concerned, "That's an awfully big hole for a goldfish, isn't it?" 

 Amy patted down the last heap of earth then replied, "That's because he's inside your damn cat."
