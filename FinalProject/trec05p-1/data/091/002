Hey reitmeyj,

Welcome to Yahoo! Sports Fantasy NBA.

This note is to confirm that you've created the team called
WXGURU and signed up for one of our Public Leagues, where 
you'll compete against other managers who've chosen the same 
settings as you have.

You have chosen to participate in an autopick draft.  Set your 
draft status to ready by using the change status option found 
on your Edit Pre-rankings page (all drafts must be conducted by 
Thursday, November 29).  We'll notify you by email as soon as your
team has been selected.

We have set default player rankings for you, but suggest you
personalize them to your liking. You can begin pre-ranking
players as soon as you want to by simply going to the
Fantasy NBA home page and clicking on your team name.

Thanks for joining.  Good luck.

--Fantasy NBA Commissioner
