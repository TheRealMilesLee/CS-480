Richard - Per your request of Friday 10/19, this is the list of San Francisco users in question. You mentioned there are probably only 4 or so users that actually need to be exemptions to the Email retention policy. Do we need to do any kind of special communication the 4 or so users or the remaining SF users that are not exempt?

Thanks-
Cyndi

Cyndi,
Here is the latest exclusion list, it includes the 29 San Francisco users.  The one SF user that is on 05v has been disabled.
Thanks,
Tim
