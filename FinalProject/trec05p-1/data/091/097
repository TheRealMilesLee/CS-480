Hi:
Hope you are all doing well. I liked the pictures you sent Mom of the girls
at the zoo. She is amazed by the digital camera technology.

I found some nice sleeping bags for Reagan and Madison at JC Penney. They
have animals on them and the pillows are the animal on the bag. They have a
dog, bear, dolphin, frog and monkey. Which animals do you think each girl
would like? I'll also get each of them some "Little House" books. What does
Lauren need? What do the two of you want? Do you want a gift certificate for
a restaurant so you can go have a nice evening together or something for the
new house?

Mom is apparently telling both of us the same thing for Dad. Are you
planning to get the clippers or shall we? I know he also wants some chairs
for the patio. Let me know what you decide, and I'll get the other.

It's 284 days until my partner starts, not that I'm counting. I'm firing one
of my nurses--actually we're transferring her to another department because
she hasn't screwed up enough to fire but she is just not giving me the help
I need to run a busy practice. My front office staff is finally catching on
to things. So overall I think I'm calmer. We're going to Fredericksburg next
week for a 3 day weekend.

Take care,
Meg
