Thanks for the response.  A face to face with Mike I sounds like a good idea.  Among other things, remind him to contact Michelle Cash when he intends to use an outside counsel for legal matters.  Also, I'd like to review his 2001 and 2002 HR Budget with you when you get your hands on it.

Saw the email you forwarded......someone's lost the plot here!

I had sent an email to Mike -hinting that there should no longer be a need for retention (didnt want to go into print and actually say NEPCO was off the table given there's still one interested buyer in play, and I havent yet thought thru the impact of bringing in a partner).

Have now left two voicemails for Mike asking him to call to discuss.


Will be talking to Brian about it today, and will probably go up to Bothell for a day next week (mountains and Mohammad)! Also plan on getting together with Aaron and Lydecker early next week.

Will keep you posted
