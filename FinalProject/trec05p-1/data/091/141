DEAR SIR/MADAM,
I MAKE THIS APPEAL WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ANY FACTS OR OPINION EXPRESSED BY ME ARE GIVING IN CONFIDENCE AND SOLELY FOR YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND USE. 
I AM A  MANAGER WITH STANDARD TRUST BANK PLC OF NIGERIA. I WILL LIKE
TO DO  BUSINESS WITH YOU.  THERE IS AN ACCOUNT IN MY BANK WITH A CREDIT BALANCE OF (USD$21.000.000.00) TWENTY-ONE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS, WHICH HAS BEEN DORMANT FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS NOW.
ON MY FURTHER INVESTIGATION, I DISCOVERED THAT THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT, A FOREIGNER,MR. MORRIS THOMPSON (AN AMERICAN) AND AN INDUSTRIALIST WHO WAS A RESIDENT OF ALASKA, ALSO DIED FOUR YEARS AGO DIED AND THAT HE LEFT NO BENEFICIARIES NOR NEXT OF KIN FOR THE ACCOUNT, BECAUSE HE WAS HIDING THE SOURCE OF THE MONEY FROM HIS GOVERNMENT.
WHAT I NEED FROM YOU IS TO USE YOUR NAME AS THE BENEFICIARY AND NEXT OF
KIN TO THE ORIGINAL ACCOUNT OWNER, AND THEN USE MY POSITION AS THE MANAGER AND GIVE CLEARANCE FOR ONWARD REMITTANCE OF THIS FUND INTO YOUR NOMINATED ACCOUNT. I WILL SUPPLY YOU WITH ALL THE NECESSARY
INFORMATION ABOUT THE ACCOUNT, WHICH YOU WILL PRESENT TO THE BANK THROUGH A LAWYER.
AFTER THE BANK HAS ACCEPTED YOUR APPLICATION, THEN I WILL MOVE AHEAD TO
DESTROY EVERY DOCUMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BUSINESS. AND WE WILL GO AHEAD TO SHARE THIS FUND AT A RATIO OF 70% FOR ME AND 25%  TO YOU FOR
YOUR SERVICES TO ME AND THE REMAINING 5% WILL BE SET ASIDE FOR ANY EXPENSES INCURRED DURING THIS TRANSACTION.
THANKS
YOURS FAITHFULLY,
MR. CREDO MIKEL
