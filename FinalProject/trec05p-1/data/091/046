Subject: [Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Crowell OUT For Season
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hi Folks,

After Biakabutuka, another mid level guy with potential is apparently gone.

ESPN.com is reporting that Detroit WR Germane Crowell is out for the season
with a knee injury.   From ESPN.com :  "Detroit coach Marty Mornhinweg said
Crowell probably will not be able to play again this season."

This probably boosts the value of WR Johnnie Morton but clearly decreases
the value of QB Charlie Batch who seemed to connect well with Crowell.
Wait to see how it shakes out for the # 2, but I'd expect Larry Foster to
get the first shot.

More as we hear it.

Joe
