Extreme Chat Forums!

 The biggest, little corner of the web.

 Let's face it, the WWW is a pretty big place. All the info scattered over millions upon millions of pages. Wouldn't it be easier if there was a place where all the best bits could be collected, linked too and discussed in a single site? Well that's where Extreme Chat Forums comes in.

 ECF hopes to bring together the best of the net with a great community. And that community is constantly growing. Together with the general stuff linked to above, ECF also covers a broad range of subjects, and will be expanding further in the future.

 There's TV, Movies, Music and Literature:

 Gaming:

 Hobbies, including writing, drawing, painting and other arts:

 You can even have your very own board, which can be open to everyone, or limited to only a select few. And for the wrestling fans who like a bit of role-playing, you can even have your very own role-playing federation(E-Fed):

 And in addition to the many boards already available there's also a chatroom:

 So no matter what you've got to say, there's someway, and somewhere for you to say it at ECF. Want to share something? Feel free to post it, and I'm sure the other members will make good use of our brand new 'Thank You' hack, to show their gratitude. Looking for something but haven't turned it up in any searches? Just ask, and I'm sure someone will be able to help.

 But we're not over just yet. As well as all the above ECF also includes a great RPG that can be used by all members. Here you can battle the RPers in a fierce competition for fortune and glory!

 Of course, these are just the basics. Its up to you to explore and make full use of everything the site has too offer. I'm sure you wont regret it.
