Hi Michelle, 

The original fax I sent to you on Friday are the only names that John wanted the letters for.  I misread the paper and did 4 extra people by mistake.  EEEK!  Anyway - I think he may want some revisions today, so please let me know if you are making any adjustments or changes to the documents from Friday!  Thank you!

Best Regards,
