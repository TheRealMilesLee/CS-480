I spoke with Joe Dilg over the weekend regarding V&E's assistance with respect to questions/issues surrounding our structured finance vehicles.  He advised that V&E retained Williams & Connally to represent them in connection with inquiries made of V&E by the Special Committee.  Williams & Connally apparently has interviewed the V&E individuals involved in the vehicles/transactions and has compiled quite a bit of info re the same.  Joe advised that as we pose questions to V&E, they will involve Williams & Connally to make certain that the answers that we receive are consistent with information provided to the Special Committee. Please keep this in mind as inquiries are made to V&E.  Thanks and hope that each of you have a very happy new year!   Regards,  Julia
