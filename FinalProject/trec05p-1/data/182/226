Michelle,
Rao Tamma is an employee that is identified to go to NETCO and he is on an employment agreement. He has found another job and wants to know if his non-compete still exists. We are current on all our payments to Rao and our next payment isn't due until 6/02. Please advise. Feel free to call me at 713-345-7842. Thanks!
 
Mandy

Hi Amanda,
    I am pursuing oppurtunities outside Enron. And I need a signed letter that states that I am free from the two year contractual agreement that I signed July 2000. If I can get one by Jan 3, 2002 that would be great. Can you please help me in this regard. Happy New Year.
Thanks
-Rao
