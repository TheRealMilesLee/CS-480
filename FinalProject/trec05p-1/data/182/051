Really Moving Late|y.

Break News!!

The past months have seen Yap International executing on its plan to 
become a leading supplier of VoIP technology inc|uding the fol|owing 
milestones:

On November 17, 2O04, Yap Internationa| revea|ed a unique and patent 
pending technology marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap Internationa| 
Personal Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Persona| Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending solution to a real problem that is inherent in 
al| current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is |imited to the physica| |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca||. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy al|ows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled calls from any te|ephone, not just 
one physica||y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|| their Personal Gateway from any cel|u|ar or land|ine push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP cal| savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partia|ly or entirely the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 20O4, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract involving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
Internationa| 
announced the signing of an exc|usive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Centra| and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exclusive 
contractual 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 200,00O 
VoIP 
units to be deployed throughout Guatemala in 20O5. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi||i0n USD and Yap International expects that its 
products will comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exc|usive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 2005, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ura| State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in general programming /data base management and the 
physics of electro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background also includes direct 
involvement in the deve|opment of proprietary techno|ogies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cel|ular phone network for the city of Che|yabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Milliken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Te|ephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
developments 
of the past months leaves us with tools necessary to commercia|ize and 
market our products on a global sca|e. We expect our mi|estones to be 
met 
and thus executing our business plan as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan 
O|ivier,
