button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP ca|| savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partia||y or entirely the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
te|ecommunication providers.

units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatemala in 2OO5. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mil|iOn USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products wil| comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exclusive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

team,

which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Milliken GMBH
