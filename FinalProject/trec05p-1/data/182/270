 California Energy Commission Releases
 Tracy Peaker Project Staff Assessment

  Sacramento - The California Energy Commission Staff Assessment of the
  Tracy Peaker Project is now available for review. The Staff Assessment
  - outlining the conditions that should apply to the design,
  construction, operation, and closure of the project, should the
  Commission grant a license - can be found online at:

            www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/tracypeaker/documents/

  The Staff Assessment is not a Commission decision or a proposed
  decision on the Tracy Peaker Project. It is a staff document, analyzing
  the project based on a thorough and independent review of the proposal
  in accordance with the Public Resources Code and California
  Environmental Quality Act.

  The staff has requested more information in the area of biological
  resources to complete its review. An addendum to the Staff Assessment
  analyzing the requested information and including the staff's
  recommendation on the project will be published after the January
  workshop detailed on page two.

  GWF Energy LLC is requesting approval to construct and operate the
  Tracy Peaker Project. The proposed location for the 169-megawatt,
  simple-cycle generation facility is a nine-acre, fenced site within a
  40-acre parcel in unincorporated San Joaquin County. The property is
  located six-tenths of a mile southeast of the Tracy Biomass plant and
  is bounded by the Delta-Mendota Canal to the southwest and the Union
  Pacific Railroad to the north.

  The Commission will hold Staff Assessment Workshops as follows:

        When:     Wednesday, January 9, 2002
                         5 p.m. - To last no later than 10 p.m.

                         Thursday, January 10, 2002
                         5 p.m. - To last no later than 10 p.m.

        Where:    Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites
                         3751 Tracy Boulevard
                         Tracy, California
                        (Wheelchair accessible)

  The purpose of these open and publicly noticed workshops is to allow
  members of the public to participate in the power plant certification
  process. To find out how to get involved, contact the Energy
  Commission's Public Adviser, Roberta Mendonca, at (916) 654-4489, toll
