Dear 
Richard, 

Our next catalog launches the splashproof Twin CD Shower Companion - an exciting new stereo from Sharper Image Design. It features dual vertical CD/CD-R players, an AM/FM digital PLL (Phase Lock Loop) tuner with 60 presets, a wireless remote, plus excellent sound from built-in stereo speakers. 

Innovative, water-resistant housing makes this portable system ideal for enjoying music in every room in your home - even the shower! Great for all kinds of outdoor activities, too. Like our best-selling single CD Shower Companion, this new stereo offers the unique option of hanging it from a shower rod - like a regular shower radio.

Special Offer: Place any order with this email and enjoy the monthly special <http://www.sharperimage.com/go.jhtml?tcid=42&tlid=ms&source=16825&url=http://www.sharperimage.com/us/en/catalog/prodview1.jhtml?sku=KT127> - 50% off our Leather Overnighter Bag. 
	

Having two CD players makes it easy to please the musical tastes of multiple users - or the different music desired for an energizing shower versus a relaxing bath. In addition to AM and FM, you can listen to TV broadcast audio on VHF. Other great features include ramp-up alarm clock, sleep timer, optional AC plug-in adapter and a headphone jack. We include hooks for hanging from the shower rod; a countertop stand; and a wall-mount bracket.
