A comfortable house is a great source of happiness. It ranks immediately after health and a good conscience.
When business is good it pays to advertise; when business is bad you’ve got to advertise.
Life is just a journey

Restlessness is discontent and discontent is the first necessity of progress. Show me a thoroughly satisfied man and I will show you a failure.
Give a lot, expect a lot, and if you don't get it, prune.
An expert is someone who knows more and more about less and less, until eventually he knows everything about nothing.One must learn by doing the thing, for though you think you know it, you have no certainty until you try.
There is no satisfaction in hanging a man who does not object to it
