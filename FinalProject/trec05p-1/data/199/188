Sometimes, we wonder why friends keep forwarding jokes to us
without writing a word, maybe this could explain:

When you are very busy, but still want to keep in touch, guess what
you do ... you forward jokes.  When you have nothing to say, but
still want to keep contact, you forward jokes.  

When you have something to say, but don't know what, and don't
know how, you forward jokes.  And to let you know that you are
still remembered, you are still important, you are still loved, you
are still cared for, guess what you get?  A forwarded joke.

So my friend, next time if you get a joke, don't think that you've
been sent just another forwarded joke, but that you've been
thought of today and your friend on the other end of your
computer wanted to send you a smile.  =)
