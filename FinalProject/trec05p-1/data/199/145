Doug-

Take a look at this spreadsheet I made and let me know what you think.  It takes the BES interval prices from the operating day reports and computes the following:
	
	Hourly average for each zone
	Hourly average ERCOT wide
	Daily peak average by zone and ERCOT wide
	Daily offpeak average by zone and ERCOT wide

It only is updated as often as they update their operating reports but I think it's still a useful tool for looking at prices over time.  Maybe will benefit from some graphs - spreads - both???
