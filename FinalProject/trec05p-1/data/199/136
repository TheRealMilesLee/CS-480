How are we handling this type of issue? Are we sending them a letter indicating that they still have to pay for gas we have already delivered? Are we reading the contracts on a one-off basis to determine our rights? This is probably our largest gas deal with the biggest receivable $$ in the door - and also big in the money MTM from our perspective.

Bryce,

I spoke with Scott Borgmeyer of Florida Power and Light and FPL Energy Power Mktg.
concerning their payments that are due on December 17th and December 26th.
 According to Scott, they will not be making payments to us on these days due to the termination 
of their contract effective December 12th.  They will not be paying at this time due to unwinding 
arrangements of terminated contracts.  Payment amounts due are as follows:

December 17th	$21,064,010.57  FP&L

December 26th  $ 6,965,765.30   FP&L

December 26th  $     22,077.24   FPL Energy Power Marketing

Thanks,

Max
