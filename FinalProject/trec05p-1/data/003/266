As you should all know, Jean will be out of the office on vacation from Thursday, July 12th through Wednesday, July 25th, returning to the office on July 26th.  Please note the following:

There will continue to be a weekly Upstream Products Desk head Meeting in her absence, each Monday at 3 pm in EB 3567.  She would like you to track each other's progress.

The Hot List Update will continue to go out weekly, and should be forwarded to myself each Tuesday by 10:00 AM.  I will be sending the revised Hot List to Louise Kitchen every Tuesday afternoon.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.
