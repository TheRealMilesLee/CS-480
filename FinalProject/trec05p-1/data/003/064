(Subject: CAISO Notice - Non-Operational Generation Report Change)

ISO Market Participants:

Recently, some market participants have indicated that there is some
confusion regarding the ISO's Non-Operational Generation Report, published
once daily on the California ISO Web site. This report includes any outage
to any unit at any time of the day. However, many of the reported outages
occur off-peak while consumer demand is low. Generation that is fully
available for peak periods can be shown as unavailable, even if it was
unavailable for only part of the day. 

To avoid this confusion and to provide more up-to-the-minute generator
outage information as appropriate, the California ISO will now report
Non-Operational Units on its web site based on a "snapshot" of conditions,
rather than including all outages which may have occurred at any time during
the day. Because system conditions may change throughout the day, we will
update this report throughout the day. Beginning today, the ISO will publish
the Non-Operational Generation Report four times daily at approximately 7:15
AM, 11:15 AM, 3:15 PM, and 7:15 PM at
<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/01/25/2001012508442613704.html>
http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/01/25/2001012508442613704.html. The first
report will be later today. This snapshot report will state the time when
the "snapshot" was taken. 

Please keep in mind that this information is a snapshot of conditions at the
time of the report and may change at any time. Also note that there may be
multiple outages for any given unit on these snapshot reports. Without
releasing confidential information, the ISO will indicate whether the
outages are Planned or Unplanned. If there are multiple outages, there may
be more than one such designation (one for each outage of record).

We hope that this additional information will provide a more accurate
picture of generator outages through the day. If you have any questions
about this report, you may send them to Greg Van Pelt, Manager of Outage
Coordination, at  <mailto:gvanpelt@caiso.com> gvanpelt@caiso.com.
