transaction. You will be paid 4% for your "management fees".
If you are interested, please write back by email 
euroslinks@yahoo.com  or fax 0034 653 564 416 and provide me with your =
confidential 
telephone number, fax number and email address and I will provide further 
details and instructions. Please keep this confidential; we can=92t afford 
more political problems. Finally, please note that this must be concluded 
within two weeks. Please write back promptly.I will also suggest you 
visit these news sites on the internet to be better informed about this 
project.
