   This is in response to the language you added to Great Lake's  EBB agreement, they would like to revise it.  Please let me know if you approve.

Shane,

Below you will see what our attorney suggested be added to the GLConnect
agreement instead of the language which your attorney proposed.  If your
attorney agrees, let me know and I will revise the agreement and fax it to
you.  Call me if you have any questions.
