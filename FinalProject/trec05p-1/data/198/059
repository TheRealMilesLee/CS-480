This is one unbelievable offer. Fly to Europe from $178 roundtrip, now through March 20, 2002, and you could earn double airmiles. This is one heck of a double whammy.

For 30,000 airmiles, you could fly to the Caribbean or Mexico. For example, Los Angeles, San Diego or San Francisco to Rome, Munich or Frankfurt is only $328 roundtrip and you will earn over 27,000 airmiles. If you're short on miles, you can purchase up to 5,000 additional miles for three cents a mile. In this case, you would only have to purchase 3,000 more miles for $90 to fly to the Caribbean. From Dallas to Amsterdam, you can earn 20,000 airmiles or enough miles for a free off-peak domestic ticket.
