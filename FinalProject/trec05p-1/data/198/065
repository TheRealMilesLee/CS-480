Salam for Everyone

That is happiness: to be dissolved into something complete and great.
You cannot divide the individual, man is a whole human being.
Conscience in most men, is but the anticipation of the opinions of others.

http://droste-hulshoffzx.net/qiVIH7nqv3pP2SA5OGSioY38h/BBAbMAsAJwcLTA0y.htm

Nothing is beneath you if it is in the direction of your life
A man likes his wife to be just clever enough to appreciate his cleverness, and just stupid enough to admire it.
What we have to fight for is the freedom and independence of the fatherland, so that our people may be enabled to fulfill the mission assigned to it by the creatorNothing is beneath you if it is in the direction of your life
No change of circumstances can repair a defect of character

Khuda hafiz
