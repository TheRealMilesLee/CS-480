Thanks a bunch.  They wanted to know 2 clients and you were the first that came to mind and definitely my most favorite.  I will really miss working with you.  You are so efficient, easy going, smart, kind, helpful, etc.  the list goes on and on.  Take care, Maria

Absolutely!

Currently, my title is "Director Customer Service Initiatives (I think?), Marketing, Transwestern Pipeline Company".

I thought it would be wise to broaden my horizons up here by applying to be licensed in the State of Nebraska.  Can I put you down as a client/reference?  By the way, what should I put down as your current occupation?  Maria
