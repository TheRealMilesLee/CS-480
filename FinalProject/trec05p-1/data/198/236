Teb - Even though PPL has a discounted rate for Red Rock, will we have to file it as a negotiated rate because the fuel is locked in at 5% for the term of the contract?

I am not familiar with the deal, but if the path is something different than East of Thoreau to Calif, the fuel rate is above max which I would think would qualify is as a neg rate transaction.  I would suggest talking to Teb Lokey regarding the actual filing as his shop will be making this filing.

Donna - Red Rock ?  Is PPL's discounted rate deal still going to be filed as a negotiated rate because we locked in the fuel rate at 5%?
