Travis Henry to Face Possible Sex Charges


Entire story:   http://www.buffalonews.com/editorial/20011019/1047714.asp

Clipped from the Bucky Gleason article:

Buffalo Bills running back Travis Henry faces criminal charges that are
expected to be lodged next week in connection with a sex-related incident
involving a 15-year-old girl in his home, law enforcement officials said.

The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Thursday that Henry
likely would be offered a plea arrangement that would allow him to avoid a
statutory rape charge in exchange for a guilty plea to a
yet-to-be-determined misdemeanor charge.

Charges could be filed as early as Monday or Tuesday, officials said.

"I've just become involved," said Henry's attorney, Terrence M. Connors.
"I'm talking to Travis and trying to find out the underlying facts and
exploring all the options."

Investigators have been looking into the incident since Sept. 23, when two
girls escaped from Hopevale Union Free School, a detention home for girls in
Hamburg.

Investigators said Henry, 22, had returned with the Bills from their game in
Indianapolis and met the girls, 15 and 14, during a chance encounter at a
Camp Road gas station.

The three went to watch television at Henry's house, where the sexual
encounter is alleged to have taken place with one of the girls, who
apparently told Henry she was 18.

Sources said Henry acknowledged having sex with the girl but said he didn't
know she was a juvenile.

Henry had not been charged as of Thursday. The rookie was in Jacksonville
for the Bills' game against the Jaguars.

Hamburg Police Chief Joseph Coggins would say only that the case was under
investigation. Erie County District Attorney Frank J. Clark would not
comment on the case.

A person who is older than 21 can be charged with statutory rape for having
sexual intercourse with someone younger than 17, regardless of consent.
However, authorities generally treat cases differently when one person is in
the early 20s and the other is in the midteens.

Sources said prosecutors might be willing to give Henry leniency because the
girl admitted lying about her age and said she was not forced into having
sex, and because Henry has no prior criminal record.

The Bills have been aware of the inquiry for more than a week. President and
General Manager Tom Donahoe would not comment on the case.

"Until there's something that officially comes out, I can't respond,"
Donahoe said from Jacksonville.

Let's see how this plays out.   As the article says, it's likely this would
have the end result of a misdemeanor charge.   Still troubling though.
More as we hear it.
