>>> do you know any phone number for BMG?

As far as I know, they do not do any customer service over the phone.
(A cost-saving policy, I assume.)  The best way to contact them is to
go to their web site, proceed to the customer service section, and use
the online forms to contact them.  If you are more comfortable with
low-tech methods of communication, simply send them a letter via snail
mail to the customer service address listed in your monthly magazine.
