Hi Everyone,

As you know, every semester we host a series of pizza dinners for each 
class in the Evening  & Weekend MBA Program.  The purpose of the dinners is 
to provide the students with a smaller forum from which to ask questions 
and express concerns about the program.

The schedule for this semester's pizza dinners is listed below:

Monday, October 22		C125
Tuesday, October 23		Bank of America Forum
Wednesday, October 24	Bank of America Forum
Thursday, October 25		C220

All pizza dinners are held during the break from 7:30 - 8:15pm.

The agenda items we have for this round of pizza dinners are:

(1)  Meet the new Director of the Evening & Weekend MBA Program
(2)  Discussions of new MBA options at Haas
(3)  Electives

If you have any items that you would like added to agenda, please let us 
know by responding to this email.

We hope you will be able to join us for pizza and soda,
