I ask Dana the question about pricing.  He said it was a low probability that we would not serve over the next week because of pricing concerns.

Let us look to pre-pay until the 2 January, to avoid any further default, to be confident that we are able to meet the terms of any final Standstill Agreement and to continue to serve our contracts, subject to Dana's view as to the pricing over this period, to ensure that we are still likely to make money on these contracts during this period.
