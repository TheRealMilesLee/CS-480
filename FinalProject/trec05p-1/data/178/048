Leslie:
Could you please let me know if any of these counterparties owe us a payment before the 31st or if they have failed to pay us any amounts recently?  Also, please let  me know when you receive LG&E Marketing's payment today.


Ed and Bill:
Have you heard anything from Enserco, El Paso Electric or LG&E Marketing?  Let's talk later about what the next step is on all of the 12/31 LC's as I will be in today but out the rest of the week.  Sara will fill in for me while I am gone.  Is someone calculating a Termination Amount for Enserco?
