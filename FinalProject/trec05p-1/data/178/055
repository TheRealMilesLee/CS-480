We had the rear window of a friend's minivan smashed Friday night (Dec 21)
between 7 and 9pm outside 607 Peden.

Neighbors, yesterday four cars were vandalized at Bomar St. The  glass
windows were shatered. My cousin from Michigan was visiting me. The window
behind the driver's seat was broken. The police was at Bomar and Grant with
the same problem. I am sick and tired of this abuse. And yesterday I was
also ashamed. It's not only the broken glass is all the secondary effects
that this kind of incidents cause to the victim. And the perpetrators are
probably laughing at all of us. Because for them is probably a joke. I am
sorry of giving all of you this news in this beautiful day but we need to be
aware. Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Hedda, 416 Bomar.
