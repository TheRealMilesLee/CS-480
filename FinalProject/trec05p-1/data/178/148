Pursuant to my discussion with you earlier today, attached are the following items for your use in preparing for the drawing:

1) Sight Draft form ("Sight Draft");
2) Statement of Beneficiary (Enron Clean Fuels Company) ("Statement").

Please make sure that the amount is completed in the form of the Sight Draft before it is signed by a representative of Enron Clean Fuels Company. The dollar amount should be spelled out just like a check on the line below "Pay to the Order".

Also, please make sure that the amount is typed in for the first paragraph of the Statement. Then, have the Statement signed by a representative of Enron Clean Fuels Company.

As we discussed, in order to do a draw under the L/C we must present at SG's counters in NY on or before December 28, 2001 the following:

A copy of the commercial invoice covering 30,000 barrels plus or minus 5% of MTBE delivered basis Houston, Tx at USD 0.7225 per gallon deliverd during November 2001 (telex/telecopy acceptable);
Copy of document(s) issued or cosigned by an independent inspector indicateing quantity and quality as invoiced (telex/telecopy acceptable);
Signed Statement
Signed Sight Draft

If you have any questions, please call me.  


Regards, Alan
