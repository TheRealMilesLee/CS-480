Please open the attachment which contains the business
sale agreement for the Norwegian branch of ECTRIC. 
The document is ready for signature.  

For those of you are not familiar with this
transaction, I am also attaching a short summary
description describing this deal and the need for
urgent action.  

I am in Norway, working with Eric Shaw to preserve
Enron/ECTRIC's value in the region.  Aside from this
e-mail address, you can contact me by mobile phone +47
97 523 863.  

The plan is for this document to be executed on Monday
(Dec 24).  Thanks for your assistance.  

Regards,

Matt
