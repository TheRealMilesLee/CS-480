Mark -- I am working with the East power desk to purchase space for an EnronOnline banner ad on a PJM website.  We are buying 7 ads at 500/month/ad for 3 months ($10,500 total).  They are running this ad as a pilot program offered for only 3 months.  I am attaching the agreement they sent to us.  I would like to revise section 2.01 to state that EnronOnline has first right of refusal to keep the ad on their site if they extend the program after three months.  Could you help me revise this agreement?

Thanks

Kal
