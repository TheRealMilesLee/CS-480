Stephany,

I hate to admit it, but that is because I forgot to attach it. Sorry about that.  Let's try it again.

Stephany,

Per my voicemail, I am forwarding for your review the attached sample of
Enron Upstream Company, LLC's GISB.   I apologize, but I was unable to
get the name of the trader from Mirant with whom we transacted.

Please do not hesitate to give me a call with any questions you may have
regarding the enclosed.

Thanks,
Judy Thorne
