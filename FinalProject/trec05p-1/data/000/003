John/Gerald,

We are currently trading under GTC Spot contracts with El Paso for ENA Upstream.  Would you prefer to review their Master agreement or just send them our GISB?

Thanks,
Judy Thorne

Judy:  Thank you for your quick response.  Attached please find a copy of
our pro forma master agreement for your review.  I am filling in for the
analyst, Harry Gregory, who usually handles the Enron companies while he is
on vacation this week.  This may be turned back to him when he returns but
for now, you can call me with any questions, comments or recommendations.

Thank you,
Jan McGowen
Sr. Contract Analyst
