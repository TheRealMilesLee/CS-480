ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

PREVIEW for October 28, 2001

======================================

Dear Folks –

   Shortly after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, I had a meal with
Michael Butera. We get together and talk about our spiritual journeys.
I find him a most gifted spiritual being. After listening to him for I
while, I asked him if he would be willing to come and speak to our
Ordinary Life Gathering. He his agreed to do so this Sunday.

   His title will be:

"Fear, What Is It and How to Handle It"

   This is what he says about this topic:

   "Finding ourselves alive in an independent form, vulnerable and
subject to death, we become frightened, afraid of extinction. This fear
is then projected on all our experience. Especially today we may find
that our usual consolations are not doing the trick. Like the "bottom"
reached in an addiction, we will become overwhelmed with our fear or
discover that fear is a characteristic that is unnecessary - just as an
addict discovers that the object of addiction is not necessary. What a
blessed discovery this is."

   Do yourself a spiritual favor and come to hear this spiritual
fellow.

Much love,

Bill Kerley
