Gerald,
I am researching several outstanding receivables from Bridgeline.  I am looking for the Schedules to Contribution Agreement, which is item 3 in the index of documents.  Do you know where I might obtain a copy?  Also, is there any type of brief available on these contracts.  I have seen one for ECS, so I was hoping that one might be available for Bridgeline.


Thanks for your help.
Karen
