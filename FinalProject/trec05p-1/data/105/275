Carl,  Either date works fine for me right now.  But I would prefer an afternoon or a late morning (10:30 a.m. or after) meeting.  I also would like Jean Adams to be available.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks!

Janet

There are a growing number of things for us to discuss relative to gas
supply for Pleasant Valley Station.  I would like to suggest the following
dates to meet in Houston.

Choice #1:	November 13, a morning meeting

Choice #2:	Novemer 6, a morning meeting

Please let me know (and reply all in your response) if one or both dates
work. 

I will put together an agenda of the items for discussion.
