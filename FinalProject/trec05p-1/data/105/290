Steve Wheeler would be the first person to call.  However, I feel I must have drafted this pleading very badly for it to be so misinterpreted (and you are not the only one).  The press report on the filing is virtually 100% inaccurate.  We are not suggesting a day's delay in divestiture, and I certainly don't know where the 2008 date came from.  Secondly, this filing has no effect on the Settlement, so I doubt APS will want to discuss reopening it, but you can always ask.

There is some interest here at Enron to meet with APS and talk about
Arizona, future plans and their filing (which I have not seen) to push
back transfer of the generation assets until '08.  I don't think we want
to go back into AZ and argue for restructuring all over again, but it
seems that APS will be reopening the settlement. I think we would like
to see what they might be amenable to.  Do you think you could set up a
meeting for us, or should I just call over?  Would Mr. Wheeler be the
right person to talk with?  I am not even dreaming of asking you to do
anything substantive, so don't get worried, I just would like a nice
meeting in Phoenix.
