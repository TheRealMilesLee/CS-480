As we discussed yesterday, Northern needs to be prepared in the unlikely event, power disruption occurs at Hubbard.  In order to do so would ENA please provide the following:   1) a copy of each month's Midland Power electric invoices back to October 2000,  2) the net book value of the Interconnection Facilities, and 3)  a copy of any other contracts, leases or other agreements that are necessary to provide the Compression Services at the station along with one years worth of historical cost for each.   This information can be faxed to me at (402) 398-7122.

Thanks
