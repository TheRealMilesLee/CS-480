I would like to take off Fri (28th) and Mon (31st).  Since Tana will be back in the office on Fri, that would allow one other person to take of Wed. and Thurs., and one to take of Fri and Mon, give each of us a nice break, and still leave two of us here on all days.

You better grab your chance now!

Holly, please count one of those days as my discretionary day.
