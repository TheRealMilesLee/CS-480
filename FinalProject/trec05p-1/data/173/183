Lance,

I just spoke to Mary Cook and she would like all four areas done by the end of today.  Is that doable?

		Lance,

		Can you have your install people mark with a yellow sticky or something where the analog lines for the PCs are located.  Much thanks!

					Tana, 

					The suite of offices on 29 will be complete with a fax machine and an additional analog line for P.C. dial-up access by close of business today.  The only exception to your requirements is for an additional table in the empty room.  I believe that will be in by mid day tomorrow.

					We will prepare 32 Thursday.
