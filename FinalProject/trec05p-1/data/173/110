Tuesday humor;  I think we can all relate!


I think I've found inner peace.
My therapist told me a way to achieve inner peace was to finish things I
had
started.  Today I finished 2 bags of potato chips, a lemon pie, a fifth of
Jack Daniels and a small box of chocolate candy.
I feel better already.
Pass along to those who need it.
