Hi there -

Thanks for the compliment on the picture.  It's a little unnerving putting a 
digital image of yourself out there and hoping it is a true representation.

So tell me more about yourself.  You must work hard in your job - but what 
else do you enjoy.  Are you skier or mountain enthusiast?  What brought you 
to Colorado?

I love it hear and take advantage of as many activities as I can...

Do you have big holiday plans?

S
