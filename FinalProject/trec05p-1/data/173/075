Stephanie:  scott never called back yesterday, after repeated calls.  I called him a few minutes ago, and he wanted his lawyers to talk to Gerald, before they make a deal.  So at least the ball is starting to roll.  Will let you know what happens.  Thanks

Greetings Randy:
 
Did you ever make the sale to Scott at Sid Richardson? (or anyone else for that matter)  If so, please get the information to Gerald Nemec. 
 
Thanks.
