Hi,

Thanks for the email.  Glad you enjoyed my profile.  I'd like to hear more about you!  So, are you a Colorado native or did you move here from someplace else?  How do you like working downtown?  I live in Wash Park and currently commute to Boulder 3 times a week where I work for a software company so I'm quite envious of you!  Do you have any plans for the holidays?  I'm headed to warm, sunny Florida to visit my family in West Palm Beach.  Must say I'm looking forward to it!  I leave tomorrow but I'll be taking my laptop with me and will be doing a little work/checking emails while on the road.   Are you a skier/boarder?  If so, have you gotten out yet this year?  I've been up to Breckenridge a couple of times already and it was pretty fun but I'm really hoping for some major snow storms in January! 

Well, have a good Thursday and I hope to hear back from you soon!  

Take care,

Christie

The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.
