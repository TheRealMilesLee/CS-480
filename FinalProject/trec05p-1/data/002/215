I have not received a response from you regarding the pricing discrepancies on these deals.  Please let me know which price is correct if possible.

I have two outstanding pricing issues that I tried to resolve with Gary Lamphier, but didn't have any luck.  These deals are both day deals for February 2001 done by Danny Conner. The customer is showing a pricing difference according to what we have in Sitara.  Can you please help me resolve this pricing issue.

	Sitara Deal #		Sitara Price	Customer Price

	627800			   $5.25		   $5.23
	598392			   $5.78		   $5.77
