Dear Sir/Madam,
I am MISS FINA KATE a Solicitor. I am the Personal Attorney and Legal
Representative
to "Mr. Larry Val", a national of your country, who used to work with She=
ll
Oil Development Company in Nigeria.


On the 21st of April 1999, my client, his wife and their three children
were involved in a car accident along Abuja Express Road. Unfortunately,
they all lost their lives in the event of the accident. Since then, I hav=
e
made several enquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my client's exten=
ded
relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful.


After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relativ=
es
over the Internet to locate any member of his family but of no avail, hen=
ce,
I contacted you to assist in repartrating the money left behind by my cli=
ent
in a Security Company here in Nigeria.
Particularly, the Security Company where the deceased deposited the two
trunk boxes containing $10 Million(TEN Million United States Dollars Only=
)
does
not know the content of the two trunk boxes deposited with them.


Consequently, the Security Company issued me a notice to provide the
Next-of-Kin
to claim the two trunk boxes in their custody within the next ten officia=
l
working days.
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 2 years=

now, I seek your consent to present you as the next-of-kin of the decease=
d
to claim the two trunk boxes since you are from the same country so that
the two trunk boxes can be delivered to you by the security company.


Upon receipt of the two trunk boxes, I will come over to your country to
meet with you for the disbursment of the fund, and then you and me can sh=
are
the money.
60% to me and 40% to you. I have all necessary legal documents that can
back up any claim we may make with the Security Company.


All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal
through.
I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement tha=
t
will protect you from any breach of the law.
Please reach me through my alternate e.mail address fina_kattie@jumpy.it.=






Best regards,
Fina Kate.
