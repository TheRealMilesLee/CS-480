Good morning, everyone.

Just wanted to let you know that we finally have some of our proofs 
available on-line.  It isn't our whole book, but it is a fair sample.  I 
think they got most of the pictures of you guys posted if you are interested 
in buying a print.  I believe you can order directly from the page.

If anyone wants to see more, call Andrea or myself and we can help you out.

Steps for accessing the proofs are:

1.  Point your browser to "www.elanphotography.com"
2.  From the home page, select "Weddings"
3.  From the Weddings page, select "On-line Ordering".  This will open a new 
browser window to a list of weddings shot by our photographer.
4.  Select the "Childers/Luebbering" wedding.
5.  This will prompt you to enter a username and password.
       Enter:
          username: childers
          password: gnirebbeul
6.  Browse at will.  I believe there are three or four pages of proofs.  If 
you drill down on a picture, you can order it there.

Let me know if you have any problems accessing this site.

Later,

Jason
