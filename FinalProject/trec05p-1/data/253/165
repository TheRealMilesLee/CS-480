Dearest Valued Friend,

Naturally, this letter will come to you as a surprise since
we have not 
met,permit me however It is with deep sense of honour and
respect that 
I humbly make this appeal to you with the understanding that
any fact/s 
or opinion/s expressed in this letter are given in
confidence and 
solely for your personal information and use. .If it does
not interest you ,discard the mail but if it makes sense to
you, I open my arms wide to do business with you
                
Details OF THE BUSINESS PROPOSAL

I am MR.Marcus Milton,a Zimbabwean Farmer. I am contacting
you as the 
need for me to have a foreign partner in your country has
become 
necessary due to my plans to relocate and establish a
private company in that region, as the present political
instability in the country (Zimbabwe), does not encourage
financial investment as the environment is not conducive for
investment and most of all security is not guaranteed,just
as reported by the International media. This problem started
when the Zimbabwean government under the leadership of
President Robert Mugabe announced a decree on May 31st 2001
to seize more
than 6000 white-owned farms. So far, more than 5,400 white
owned farms 
have been invaded, properties confiscated and farm lands
seized. During 
these periods, as reported by the international media and
C.N.N, more 
than 500 white farmers were killed, the government didn't
stop at this, 
as just recently the government have asked all white-farmers
to give up 
their farms to black farmers or risk going to prison.
 
Having lived in this country (Zimbabwe) for more than 35
years, I have 
no other country to go to, nor can I trace any of my distant
relatives. 
Therefore, I decided to contact you for your assistance so
that I can 
establish a company in your country and relocate there.
Also, I must 
re-iterate the importance of having a citizen of your
country to front as 
the owner of the enterprise, due to the fact that I will be
a foreigner 
in your country.
 
I have deposited in a BANK all the funds realised from the 
sales of my farmland and other farming equipment which
amounted to 
USD8.5,000,000.00 (Eight million five hundred thousand
United States 
Dollars) which I intend to start a new life with and do
business with you as soon as I relocate.
 
For now, I stay in Lagos because Zimbabwe is highly unsafe
for me and my 
family. You can mail your immediate response to me. Upon
your immediate 
response with the good intentions to help, I will
immediately instruct the BANK to make swift online wire
transfer of the funds to any of your nominated BANK
account.I will arrange for and send to you all the 
documentation that will empower your good self in finalizing
the transaction.I;e Power of Attorney, certificate of
deposit,insurance certificate and a contract agreement by
will be duely signed by both parties.Let me use this
opportunity to also inform you that this transaction is 100%
risk free and should also be handled in the most
confidential manner.
 
I have options to offer you, first you can choose to have
certain 
percentage of the money for your assistance, or you can go
into partnership for a proper profitable investment of the
money in your country. Which ever option you choose, feel
free to notify me. If for some reasons you do not prefer a
partnership, I am willing to give you 25% of the money while
the remaining 75% that is meant for me, will be for the
investment in your country. So based on the above, it is
important you communicate with me. On the event that you
cannot assist me to do the business, I beg you to still keep
my contact and existence of my fund a secret.I also want to
make available from my share of the funds the sum of one
million dollar (USD 1,000,000.00) to the TSUNAMI VICTIMS as
my kind heart felt for the survivals.
 
I also require you make available to me your confidential
telephone 
and fax numbers to enable me communicate with you easily.
 
Sincere Regards,
 
Marcus Milton.
