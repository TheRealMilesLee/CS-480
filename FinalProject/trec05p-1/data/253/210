Joe,

Based on our discussions, the facts are as follows: Prior to 12/2/01,
ENA sold gas to One Oak.  During the period 12/4-12/31/01, Duke Field
Services inadvertently flowed gas on the MRT pipeline to ENA. ENA used
the gas received from Duke Field Services to fulfill its obligations
under the sales agreement to One Oak.  

ENA is obligated to pay Duke Field Services for the gas it received and
later delivered to One Oak because this event occurred post-petition and
benefited ENA.

Shemin
