My Name is Fehmi Mehmi and I am a staff of Natwest
Bank London. I am writing following an opportunity
in my office that will be of immense benefit to both
of us.
In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of
Â£26.5million British Pounds Sterling (Twenty-Six
Million Five Hundred Thousand British Pounds) in an
account that belongs to one of our foreign customers
Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American who
unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of
Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January
31 2000, including his wife and only daughter. 

Since we got information about his death, we have
been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come
over and claim his money because we cannot release
it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or
relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking
guidelines. 
 
Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin
being his only daughter died along with him in the
plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of
this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon
this discovery that I and two other officials in
this department now decided to make business with
you and release the money to you as the next of kin
or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and
subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for
it and we don't want this money to go back into
Government treasury as unclaimed bill.

The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that
such money remained after five years the money will
be transferred into banking
treasury as unclaimed funds.
 
We agreed that 35% of this money will be for you as
foreign partner, while the balance will be for me
and my colleagues. I will visit your country for the
disbursement according to the percentages indicated
above once this money gets into your account. Please
be honest to me and trust is our watchword in this
transaction.
 
Note this transaction is confidential and risk free.
As soon as you receive this mail you should contact
me by return mail. Please note that all necessary
arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to
you has been finalised. We will discuss much in
details when I do receive your response.
Do call me and lets discuss more on this. 
 
Best regards
Fehmi Mehmet
