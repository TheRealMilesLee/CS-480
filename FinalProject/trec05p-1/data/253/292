   Word of the Day for Thursday March 21, 2002:

   logorrhea \law-guh-REE-uh\, noun:
   Excessive talkativeness or wordiness.

     By  his  own  measure,  he is a man of many contradictions,
     beginning with the fact that he is famous as a listener but
     suffers  from  "a  touch of logorrhea." He is so [1]voluble
     that one wonders how his subjects get a word in edgewise.
     --Mel  Gussow,  "Listener,  Talker, Now Literary Lion: It's
     Official." [2]New York Times, June 17, 1997

     It's also not good if your date has logorrhea.
     --Monte  Williams,  "8  Minutes  in  the  Life  of a Jewish
     Single:  Not  Attracted? Next!" [3]New York Times, March 5,
     2000

     Mr.  King,  who  possesses  an  enviable  superabundance of
     imagination, suffers from a less enviable logorrhea.
     --Michele  Slung,  "Scare  Tactics." [4]New York Times, May
     10, 1981
     _________________________________________________________

   Logorrhea  is  derived  from  Greek logos, "word" + rhein, "to
   flow."
