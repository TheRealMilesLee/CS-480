Kevin:

I just checked with Rob Kilmer, a TW old hand.  He said that Texas Eastern bought TW before 1974, but he was not sure exactly when.

I suggest that in the Historical Organization Section, we just say "sold to Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation and again to Houston Natural Gas in 1985 ....".
