Joe,
 
We suffered a loss in the family last night and I will not be coming in today.  I was able to get a hold of Matt Lenhart and asked that he give you a call regarding the curves we were discussing yesterday.  You can reach me on my cell phone if you need anything (713-775-6472).
 
Susan
 
-Could you please forward this to Ed as I do not have access to his email from home.
