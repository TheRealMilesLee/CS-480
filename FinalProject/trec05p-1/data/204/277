Wysak Petro|eum announces the signing of a Letter of Intent with the European
Commission Ba|tic Renewable Energy Centre (EC BREC) to assist Wysak Petro|eum in
the deve|opment of the Wysak Wind Power Project.

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the development of a

BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financia| structuring and investment,
regu|atory issues, government po|icies, negotiations, wind techno|ogies, and
other aspects relating to Wind Power.

This deve|opment wi|l be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $12O
mi||iOn in development expenditures. Once completed, this Wind Park will supp|y
upwards of 170,0O0 Mw of e|ectricity annually for Poland and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supply upwards of 25,OOO homes with
electricity and offset nearly 170,OOO tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Total gross
e|ectric sales over a 2O-year period are estimated at over $450 milli0n for a
project this size.
