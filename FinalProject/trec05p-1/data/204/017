From : Mr Jainakai Liu
Dah Sing Bank Ltd,
Mei Foo Sun Chuen Branch
Kowloon,
Hong Kong,

I am Mr.Liu Jiankai, Head Private Banking of Dah Sing Bank
Ltd. I have an urgent and very confidential business
proposition for you.

On November 8th, 2001, an American consultant/contractor
with the Chinese Rail Corporation, Mr. Morris a private
business man unfortunately Lost his life in the plane crash
of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31st 2000, including his wife and only daughter.You can read more about the crash on visiting these sites
below,

1. http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list
2.http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html

Before the plane crash, Mr. Morris Thompson made a numbered
fixed deposit for 18 calendar months with a value of
US$14,300,000.00 (Fourteen Million Three Hundred thousand
Dollars only) in my branch.Upon maturity,I sent a routine
notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply.

After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered
from his contract employers, the Hong Kong Rail Corporation
that Mr. Morris Thompson died from a Air Plane crash
accident. On further investigation,I found out that he died
with his family, and also
without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next
of kin was fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that
Mr. Morris Thompson did not declare any other kin or
relations in all his official documents apart from his wife
and daughter,whom also died in the said crash,including his
Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$14,300,000.00 is still
sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over
with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward
to claim it. According to Laws of Hong Kong, at the
expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the
ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to
claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Morris
Thompson so that the fruits of this old man's labor will
not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.This is
simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full
names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents
and affidavits that will put you in place as the next
of kin.

The money will be paid into your account for us to share in
the ratio of 65% for me and 30% for you and 5% for Expenses
Incurred in the course of the transaction . There is no
risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will
be done by the attorney and with my position as the Head Private Banking guarantees
the successful execution of this transaction. If you are
interested, please reply immediately to my email.
liujiankai@kaixo.com Upon your response,

I shall then provide you with more details and relevant
documents that will help you understand the transaction.
You should observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured
that this transaction would be most profitable for both of
us because I shall require your assistance to invest my
share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply.

Thanks and regards.

Mr.Liu Jiankai.
