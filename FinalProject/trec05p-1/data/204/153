Thanks for the kind words, Jerilynn.

Regarding "toque blanche," I knew that a toque was the traditional brimless
chef's hat, but was unsure of the spelling.  Looking at my on-line
dictionary (www.m-w.com), I got the right spelling and found out that the
adjective "blanche" (white) was commonly appended.  So I added it, too.

I'll pass along your appreciation to Kim.

John

a

John

fellow

seated

> Galveston, and was astoundingly and persuasively well-informed about the
> restaurant and its wonderful offerings.  The menu, the "daily" menu and
the
> "off-menu" menu were replete with fabulous dishes, exquisitely prepared.
> Kim is still marvelling over the small dark round objects that had a
> delicate smoky taste, and of which her husband guessed were some sort of
> mushroom, only to discover that they were roasted baby brussell sprouts.

> After an appetizer selection that included a very light White Lobster

was
