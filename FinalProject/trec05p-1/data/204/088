The Dynamic Extracts have been temporarily disabled. This was necessary
to correct an issue with an extract and verify that all extracts are
operating properly. We hope to have these restored soon, and will send
notice when they are. If you have questions or immediate concerns,
please contact you Client Services Representative.
