We are in the process of preparing a list of all changes to the NETCO as of Friday. These would most likely be people that were offered jobs, turned them down and were replaced. I don't think we have had very many of these yet but I just wanted to verify. If you could get back with me today that would be great. John Lavorato is wanting this report by Tuesday am. Please feel free to call me if you have any questions at 713-516-0324. Thanks!
