Hi Richard,
     
I am writing to let you know (if you have not heard already) that over
twenty-five former Regional Directors of the Global Association of Risk
Professionals (GARP) have formed a new international nonprofit
association of risk managers. The new association, called the
Professional Risk Managers' International Association (PRMIA, pronounced
as "premia"), will include local chapters in Europe, Asia, the Middle
East, North America and South America. If you would like to know more
about the new organisation and how to join please email me and I will be
happy to give you more details.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Regards

Geoff Kates
