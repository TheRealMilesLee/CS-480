ERCOT will be conducting follow up training on 814 enrollment
transactions along with information on drop to POLR, Move-In, Move-out
and concurrent processing.
 
The training session will be held at the ERCOT Met Center on Thursday,
January 17th, 2002 in Room 206A from 9:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M.
 
Because of space constraints, participation is limited to 50, so please
email your RSVP to kbergman@ercot.com ASAP. If necessary a follow up
training session will be scheduled at a later date.
 
We look forward to seeing you next week.
 
Thanks,
