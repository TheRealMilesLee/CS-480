<p><font size="1.0px">House and Senate backers unveiled a bill dubbed the Access to 
Legal Pharmaceuticals Act (ALPhA) on Thursday. It would allow a pharmacist to 
refuse to fill a prescription only if the prescription can be passed to and 
filled by a co-worker at the same pharmacy. According to NARAL Pro-Choice 
America, a reproductive rights group, legislators in 10 states are considering 
bills that would permit pharmacists to refuse to fill birth control 
prescriptions. A federal law, if passed, would pre-empt any state law.</font></p>
