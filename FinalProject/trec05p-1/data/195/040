Dear Traveler:</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Voyages to Asia is a specialty travel company to China and the Orient. </DIV>
<DIV>
Our business consists exclusively of programs individually arranged for families, groups of friends, and major university study tours to China and its neighbouring countries. </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Unlike other mass tour operators, we mainly specialize in custom-made private trip itineraries, using the very finest hotel accommodation and unique ground tour arrangements. </DIV>
<DIV>
So our group size is always small with an average of 6 and maximum of 12 tour participants. Therefore, you enjoy more flexibility, more personal attention and more comfort.</DIV>
<DIV>
Our&nbsp; itineraries can be seen on our&nbsp; online catalogue <A href="http://www.voyagestoasia.com"><FONT color=#0000FF><U>www.voyagestoasia.com</U></FONT></A> and have been carefully formulated to ensure your maximum enjoyment. </DIV>
<DIV>
However, if you are unable to find an itinerary that suits you, we would be happy to tailor-make one catering to your particular needs and interests. </DIV>
<DIV>
Whether you require a short itinerary visiting Tokyo, Beijing and Hong Kong and staying at the finest hotels, or you wish to spend four or five weeks exploring some of the remote corners of China and the Orient, we would be pleased to offer you our prompt assistance and professional advice.</DIV>
<DIV>
We specialise in groups for Universities and colleges, for further assistance its just a local call 0845 838 5114 and speak to one of our reservation team.</DIV>
