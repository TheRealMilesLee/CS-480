MARKET NOTICE

In Re:  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's ("FERC") June 19, 2001  
 	 "Order On Rehearing Of Monitoring and Mitigation Plan For The
 	 California Wholesale Electric Markets, Establishing West-wide
Mitigation,
 	 And Establishing Settlement Conference." 

 	The ISO is considering new processes for implementation of the
must-offer obligation that would permit compliance with the FERC's Order and
take into consideration the particular concerns of generating units with
long start-up times and operating costs that may not be fully recoverable
during periods of relatively low Energy prices.  As indicated in the ISO's
compliance filing in response to the FERC Order and as indicated by the ISO
during the ISO's Market Participant Conference Call on July 16, through this
Market Notice the ISO is providing notice of the following dates and
actions:

Monday, July 23, 2001:	The ISO will post on its Home Page a draft
 				implementation proposal on the
above-mentioned 
 				issue for review and comment;

Friday, July 27, 2001:	Written comments on the draft implementation
  				proposal are due;

Tuesday, July 31, 2001:	The ISO will post a revised draft implementation
 				proposal and, as appropriate, responses to
written
 				comments;

Thursday, August 2, 2001:   The ISO will hold a conference call with Market
 				Participants and interested parties.
