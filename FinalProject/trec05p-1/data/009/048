Cara,

Following issues are handled in this version.. 

Slowness - Overall optimization of handling all routines dealing with data extraction within sheets.

"Variant Conversion" errors showing up upon routing. - this issue ended up being multiple issues but now dealt with.. 

"Copy Workspace" functionality - Created under 'Workspace' menu option 

"Capability not supported: deal has multiple delivery points" - handled as being a transmission deal which will not be handled in this version.

Print button on error form - Printing the error sheet functionality 

Font button within Excel utilities bar -  Allow change font properties (color, bold, etc) and cell properties (highlight color) 

Search button within Excel utilities bar - Allow searching in the sheets. e.g. search for a deal number.

Will,
Were the routing records deleted for 6/22 at TVA (Into System) ?


Also,  I'm trying to find consistent errors (to confirmation) ... having a difficult time getting started.
