Subject:	Gray Davis' latest

CA, under Gray Davis leadership, has been buying power at roughly $135 per megawatt hour.  Because CA has no real experience in the business of buying and selling power, they've bought far too much and been forced to dump their power glut back on the market for as little as $1-15.

Gov. Davis reaction, "Who cares.  That's just minutiae."
