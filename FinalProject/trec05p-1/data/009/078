We are told by a private source that Sen. John Burton has promised that he "can prevent anything with a rate increase for consumers from passing the Senate--I can make that stick, I have done the head count."

He will push SB78xx, which puts all rate increases on the business sector.  Bad news for all the bills (supported by SoCal) that spread the rate increases more widely.  When the legislature resumes in August, a continued push for this bill by Burton could push SoCal into bankruptcy.
