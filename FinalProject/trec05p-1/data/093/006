Please be advised that this contract is setup between Enron North America Corp.  and Northern Natural Gas Company.
 
 
I have confirmed with Zula Carter 3-5473, Northern Natural Gas, that Enron North America Corp. is the agent for Great River Energy on this pipeline.
 
 
I have an executed copy of the contract.  I do not have an executed copy of the agency agreement.  
 
 
I need to know if I can change the Global Contract and the Deal No. 762368 to reflect the agency relationship.
 
 
Please respond as soon as possible.
 
 
Thank You.
