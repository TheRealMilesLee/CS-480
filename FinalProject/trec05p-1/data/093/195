Ken/Greg:

The water cooler talk is focused around two areas:  potential bankruptcy and liquidity concerns; and massive layoffs (30% or so).  

Clearly, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs dictates that tomorrow's meeting address:
Personal issues:
-	Commitment and ability to pay salary and bonuses
-	Potential layoffs
Company-related issues
-	Risk of Enron bankruptcy
-	Sources and uses of liquidity;

I believe I know the answers to all of the above but these are the issues upon which the 'average' employee is focused.
