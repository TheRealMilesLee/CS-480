Michelle:  I think I filled out the service request right.  We are looking to pick up the San Juan lateral space for 10,000 MMBtu per day starting 6/1/2001 for a term of 15 years to match our Red Rock expansion space from the Permian to the Cal Border.  Let me know if you have gotten the fax. 

In addition, is there any chance there will be any LaPlata-Blanco space becoming available at any time in the near future that you can see and what's the rate?  Hey who's releasing this lateral space?  I'm assuming someone turned it back since you said it was exisiting capacity.

Sorry I didn't get to talk to you earlier...we have been in one meeting
after another!

What's going on?  The receipt points are in the Blanco area at the
Bloomfield Compressor, so that would include the Transcolorado point.
The NWPL interconnect is further north, where we are currently fully
subscribed.

FYI, one of the meetings I was in, was a strategy session on what to do
what all our remaining capacity (of which part of that is what you are
now interested in).  Transwestern is thinking of posting an open season
utilization this space with California capacity.  

It sounds like you guys are definitely interested and because I am out
of the office next Monday, please call me on my cell phone 713-907-3198.

Michelle:  I did talk to Rick Maceyka (my boss) regarding our
conversation about the lateral space on TW.  We are definitely
interested.

Is the receipt point in SJ pool good from either NWPL or Transcolorado? 

Thanks, Terri
