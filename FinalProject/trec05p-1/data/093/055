I haven't actually done anything yet, but my model is built, I just need to add the inputs (vol, price, correl...).  I will call you when I do.  Thanks.

Hi John,

I'm the one who's working with eric on the spread option price. Jared indicated you'd get him something today....could you tell me what your using for you vols (FGT/MKTAREA and correlations (between Z2/Z3, and between (Z2/Z3) and FGT/MKTAREA)? Also, once I've plugged in the numbers if you'd like to see my results, let me know.

thanks, 

cjc
