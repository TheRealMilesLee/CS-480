This was sent to me and I thought it was hilarious. Also, Dave went on a Business Salmon Fishing Trip in Vancouver and we now have 160 lbs of salmon.  Could you please send any Salmon recipes you have, I only know how to fix salmon 2 ways.  Thanx - Dawn

SUBJECT:  THE HOMOSEXUAL AGENDA
Many of you have heard Dr. Laura, Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, and others speak of the "Homosexual Agenda," but no one has ever seen a copy of it.  A friend of mine recently obtained a copy directly from the Head Homosexual.  At long last we will all know exactly what is on this "Homosexual Agenda".  I certainly hope it will assist all of you so that you will be prepared...
