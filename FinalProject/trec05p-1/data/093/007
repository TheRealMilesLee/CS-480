Claudia please arrange a conference call with Tim, John and myself to discuss the method for allocation going forward.

Please note that John is in Calgary and has a 1 hour time difference and Tim is in Seattle with a 2 hour time difference.

Thanks.

I am amenable to many different allocation methods.  I think that John has a good point.  John, the allocation for Canada includes both Toronto and Calgary.  However, there is also an argument that there should be some fixed component and a transaction-based component.  

I think that we need to come up with one methodology that applies to Canada, West, and East.  What methodology do you guys want to use?

Since Alberta Power trades 15 times/day and East and West power trade in excess of 1000 times/day, I believe that a 10% allocation for my desk is inappropriate.  I would be willing to settle for 5% and I believe that this is more that generation/
