Subject: [Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Seifert Names Huntley Starting RB

Hi Folks,

As we reported to you last night, Tshimanga Biakabutuka is out for the year
with a broken foot.   That brought an avalanche of "who's the starter now?"
emails.

Fortunately, Coach George Seifert answered that today in his weekly press
conference.

From the Official Panthers Website:
http://www.cpanthers.com/games/index.cfm?cont_id=75023

Seifert on Sunday's Injuries:   "There is significant loss as far as a
couple of our players. Tshimanga Biakabutuka's right foot was operated on
last night. It will be some time before he will be able to be active. By
some time, I mean a number of months. He is obviously going to go on injured
reserve and won't play this season. Also, an ACL tear was sustained by Kevin
Donnalley in his right knee, and he is going to be placed on injured reserve
as well. It will probably be a couple of weeks before he has that operated
on. Hannibal Navies broke his right arm, and he is being operated on today.
He will be out a minimum of six weeks. It could be longer, so there are some
decisions that have to be made there, also. Those are the three most
significant injuries. I don't have anything to report specifically about any
others right now. Steve Smith's knee is bothering him. But I've got to wait
until Wednesday when I can be more accurate about who is going to be
available to us. Obviously, Biakabutuka, Donnalley and Navies won't be. Dan
Morgan will not play. Kory Minor will not play. Deveron Harper will not
play. We will wait and see on Jason Peter."

Seifert on running back Richard Huntley:   "As we go into this next game,
Huntley would be our starting running back. He has progressed from the
standpoint that he is now healthy. There was a period throughout camp where
he didn't practice. So he has a better feel for what we are doing. He hasn't
had an awful lot of opportunities, but now is the time when somebody comes
to the front. Here's a golden opportunity. He came in here wanting to be the
starting back. Now he is going to have his chance to do that."

As Seifert said, this is Huntley's "Golden Opportunity".   Not quite the
"Golden Opportunity" handed to Trung Canidate as the Panthers are a
struggling team, but still, Huntley gives you the chance to scoop up an NFL
Starting RB and that doesn't happen very often.   The injury to OL Kevin
Donnalley will hurt though.   Carolina gets a break this week against the
Jets but they have a tough stretch after that with Miami, St. Louis, San
Francisco, Atlanta and New Orleans.   So I wouldn't trade the farm to pick
him up, but he could be a value if the price is right.

More as we hear it.

Joe
