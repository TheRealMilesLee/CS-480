Hi All,

We've been looking into determining why certain reports are taking longer to run than usual.

After examining the log, it seems that, either by fact or coincidence, the longer runtimes 
began to occur after our migration to the new database server -- no code had been changed.

Although there are other possible causes to investigate, we can start by rebooting 
our machines to ensure there aren't any issues caused by low memory on the machines 
running reporting jobs as scheduled tasks. 

We will continue to look into the possible cause of the bottle neck, and will seek to have it resolved
this week.  However in the meantime please reboot your machine if it is running scheduled
reporting jobs.

Thanks,
Kim
