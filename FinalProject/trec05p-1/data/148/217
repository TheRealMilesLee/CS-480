Gentlemen and ladies,

Check it out, OSU beat OU (NO ONE thought THAT was possible) we are going to 
the Big 12 Championship game VS. Colorado.

Damn we're smooth.


Hook'em Horns.

Brett.

AUSTIN -- Texas coach Mack Brown was channel surfing through college 
football Saturday, hoping his team would get a break.

It wasn't too long before his television was locked in on the second half of 
Oklahoma State's 16-13 upset of Oklahoma.

His phone was ringing off the hook as the final seconds ticked down. Brown's 
fifth-ranked Longhorns were now Big 12 South Division champs and headed to 
the conference title game next Saturday against Colorado.

"I had some players calling and screaming with 20 seconds left," Brown said.

"Our two sons and my wife were screaming and shouting like they were on the 
sidelines. We had some unsportsmanlike conduct there, I think."

Brown said he tried to stay calm after the Cowboys took the lead in the 
final two minutes. He was trying to figure out how many timeouts and how 
much yardage the Sooners needed to pull off the victory or at least tie and 
send it to overtime.

"That's what coaches do," Brown said. "We're trying to figure out how to win 
the game."

Ranked 11th or higher all season, Texas (10-1, 7-1 Big 12) had been on the 
outside looking in at the South division title. The Sooners handed Texas its 
only defeat back in October and had the head-to-head advantage before 
Saturday.

The Sooners were heavy favorites to beat Oklahoma State before the loss 
dropped the Sooners to 10-2 overall, 6-2 in the Big 12.

"You really don't know in this crazy game of college football what's going 
to happen," Brown said. "As of yesterday, nobody thought Colorado and Texas 
would be in this ball game."

Colorado (9-2, 7-1) won the North division with its 62-36 whipping of 
Nebraska on Friday, a game the Texas players could listen to on their way 
home from a 21-7 win over Texas A&M.

The Longhorns defeated Colorado 41-7 back in October. Brown said the rematch 
should be much closer.

"We won the game handily but they had some turnovers early in the game. 
Obviously they're playing much better now than they were then," he said.

Colorado coach Gary Barnett said his team is happy to have another crack at 
Texas.

"We'll be primed for the rematch," Barnett said. "We know we didn't play 
very well the first time and we'd like to think that wasn't who we really 
are."
