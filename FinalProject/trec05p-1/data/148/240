John, I maybe "seeing ghosts" but the prospects of us getting paid under the current form of paper are remote. As per my voicemail, the following changes need to made: 

1. Performance Bonuses - needs to be small caps (ie performance bonuses)
2. remove the words "to be provided to you under your existing bonus opportunity" so the sentence reads " This memorandum describes performance bonuses for calendar year 2001 performance..."
3. after affiliate, insert " or any of the respective successors, assigns, representatives, trustees or administrators"
4. specify "U.S $"
