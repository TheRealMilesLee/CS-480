excellent!
My turkey day was nice - saw my niece that i haven't seen in 10 years - had about 18 people at my parents, so it was a mad house!

Didn't do alot, did some shopping, set up my new computer, went to dinner, cleaned the house....how about you?

just wanted to remind you to start looking for your c-card now!  don't know if you want to scuba or not, but nice to 
have options.

Hope you had a nice thanksgiving - we need to go for drinks soon!
