Dear Students,

The library will close at 5pm on Wednesday, November 21 (the day before
Thanksgiving) and will be closed through Thanskgiving, Thursday, November
22. Will re-open from 1-5pm on Friday, November 23 and resume regular
weekend and other hours thereafter.

Though you will be in classes on Wednesday, you will find that most of Haas
and the UCB campus are in "out for holidays" mode. I will not be here on
Wednesday since the library will be closed in the evening. Send weekend
questions NOW if you want a response from me before next Monday.

Give yourselves a nice holiday and I look forward to seeing your refreshed
faces when you return.

Monica Singh
