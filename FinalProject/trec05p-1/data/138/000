>Dear Investor Friend,
>
>As you may know, I have been making my subscribers rich for over a decade.
>
>As a best-selling investment author, ON24 Analyst, and award-winning
>editor of The Natural Contrarian financial publication, I have made
>thousands of investors mega-rich over the years.
>
>Just 10 weeks ago I told my Elite Subscribers about a stock which was
>trading at $2.76. Within 10 weeks it hit $5.06 -- a gain of 83%.
>
>Amazing? Maybe.
>
>But vast profits are commonplace for my Elite Subscribers.
>
>To put it simply, my Elite Subscribers have been making money
>hand-over-fist. And they are about to become even richer.
>
>You see, the stock I just told you about -- the one that shot up 83% in 10
>weeks -- will soon be going higher. Much higher.
>
>I will tell you more about that at a later date -- but first let me tell
>you about my track record.
>
>My last 3 oil and gas stock picks made 660%, 230%, and 915%. In fact, I am
>receiving constant "thank you" emails from my followers who have become
>multi-millionaires buying and selling my oil and gas stock picks over the
>last several months.
>
>Just think how your stock portfolio would look today if you had:
>
>* bought shares in Pennaco Energy at $2.50 and sold at $19
>* took a position in Atlas Pipelines -- before it lept over 230%
>* purchased Ultra Petroleum 11 months before it shot-up 915%
>
>In fact, if you had been one of my Elite Subscribers you would have made
>vast profits on Pennaco, Atlas and Ultra -- plus you would have racked up
>multiple triple-digit stock gains back-to-back.
>
>As you can see, many of my Elite Subscribers have become mega-rich. That's
>why they pay me $1,000 -- year in and year out.
>
>But my bottom line is this: even though you are not one of my Elite
>Subscribers (yet), I still want you to become rich.
>
>As one of my free subscribers, you won't receive the ultra-secret stock
>picks that I share with my Elite Subscribers. But once in awhile, I will
>tell you about a stock that will create vast profits for you.
>
>On one condition.
>
>I want you to promise to reserve some of your profits to become one of my
>Elite Subscribers.
>
>That's a fair deal, right?
>
>But remember, this gift has strings attached: I want you to promise that
>you will reserve $1,000 of your profits to become one of my Elite
>Subscribers.
>
>So get ready for my next email.
>
>And get ready to make a fortune.
>
>Yours,
>
