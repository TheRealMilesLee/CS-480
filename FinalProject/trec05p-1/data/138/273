I am trying to coordinate a meeting with you, Tanya Rohauer, Kim Theriot, Bryce Baxter and myself to discuss payment netting for physical gas contracts. It seems as though there is some confusion as to when Enron is able to net, depending on the type of contract on which the deal was confirmed. I am shooting for early next week so please let me know your availability.

-Darren
