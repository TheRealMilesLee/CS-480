 A federal attorney I know gave me this site, I thought you might find
 it interesting. You can check to see if the FBI has ever had a file on you.
 I was shocked to see that there was a file on me.
 Do not use your Social Security Number. Just check your state, and put in
 your name, if a match is found they will ask for a year of birth to narrow
 the search.
 You will get the case number, date of investigation and any photos on
file.
 It's a free site, but is expected to be closed due to a federal court
order.
