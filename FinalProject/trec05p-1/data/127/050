It is that time of year.... Please complete your list of accomplishments by the end of November.  

Also, please complete your 2002 Objectives by December 14.  Your objectives will need to outline your specific marketing plan for each customer, project and idea you may have for adding/increasing value to Transwestern in 2002.  As discussed earlier, we will get together in mid-December to review account loads to see if we need to do any shifting.  Your 2002 Objectives will be helpful in determining whether your load is heavy, light or just right.   

I will be happy to visit with each of you individually if you have any questions or would like to discuss these items.    :>)

Thanks,
Kim.
