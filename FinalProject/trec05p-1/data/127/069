Per the file, I see a separation agreement that you drafted that indicates the Company will pay for the London apartment through April 30, 2001.  I suggest that be removed since he was asked in May to vacate the apartment.  The lump-sum payment specified at the time was $350,000.  Mary has that changed?  If not, then the calc. would be $350,000 less what he owes on outstanding expense reports which would be $230,505 so for a net payment of $119,495.

This does not address whether he ultimately agreed to reimburse Enron for the tax advances.
