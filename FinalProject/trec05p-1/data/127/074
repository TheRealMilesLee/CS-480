The A&A program plans to give one month's salary to the prospective program hires for November - students who turned down other offers to accept ours. (There are only a couple - we have not made any decision about the January/February hires yet).

My understanding of our current position on this is to give one month's pay to applicants who: 1. quit a job; 2. sold a home or relocated; or 3. have visa issues.  I suggest we confer on any request regarding paying anyone who doesn't fit the above.  If we do so, we should be able to maintain some consistency.

Dear Lizzette: 

That's great news. 

I trust that we will treat each person uniformly and consistently so as to minimize allegations of discriminatory treatment.

Thanks. 

Sharon

I am generating a form waiver and release for use in cases in which we decide to pay an individual whose offer has been revoked.  I'll forward a draft to you shortly.  If you have other forms or suggestions, please forward them to me.  Hopefully, we'll all be able to be consistent and use just one form.
