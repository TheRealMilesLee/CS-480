Mr. Lay:

I appreciate the time you took to review my memo concerning internal communications suggestions. Cindy Olson called to thank me and Sarah Davis did meet with me to discuss the memo. 

I have some ideas regarding the transition and would like to share them with you and/or your communication transition team.  Could you please put me in contact with your team handling the communications for the transition or meet with me personally to discuss?  I would only take a few minutes of your time.

Thank you again for your time and all that you have done for us. You have a large following that are here to support you and Enron.  We just need direction from the top, more importantly, you. 

Yours Sincerely,

Amanda Day
