FYI,

This outage is complete, and Dave Cammock is on his way to start bringing the pressure back up at LaCrescent.

Do to the pressure being lowered to 520 psig at LaCresent on the discharge for this outage, I have reset the HI & HI HI alarm limits to give us fore warning should the regulator fail.
								Original Alarm Values		New Alarm Values
					LaCresent discharge -  HI  715	HI HI  725		HI  525    HI HI  530
					Tomah # 1 Inlet PSI  -  HI  725	HI HI 750		HI  525	  HI HI  530

FYI, 

This outage was move up from 10/25/01 to 10/2. The  outage will last from 10/02 to 10/08. We wanted to get this done earlier in the month. This is a Platteville Team outage, but the pressure reduction on the B/L is controlled by the Owatonna Team. See the details below, and the contact people.

Tomah Valve #4 replacement.  Install new valve setting 11901-BYB04 @ the Sparta Takeoff. Stopple fittings will be installed upstream and downstream of BV BYB04 and a 4" temp.bypass fab. & installed. Reduce pressure for excavation to 65% maop (520 psig) regulated at LaCrescent during stopple ops.
