Hi, Tebby:
Had a great 5-mile walk today, accompanied by two women from Hancock. One of 
them--Martha Wilder--is the daughter of the elderly man whose father AND 
grandfather were born in my house!! Just learned the latter part today. 
Martha brought over the Hancock Town History and some photos of her father, 
grandfather, and great-grandfather.

I didn't realize that I was supposed to have had checks to hand over to the 
American Cancer Society today, so I'm mailing them a check. I raised $200 
(most of it from me as I started adding names to the list--Daddy's and 
Sheryl's.) Didn't want to bother Daddy with this as I don't think he would 
have understood what I was doing and Sheryl is still pretty stressed out over 
Candice, but their names are on the sheet, along with yours, Mother's, 
Preston's, Annie Baxter's, and mine. So what I'm asking people to do is 
simply send me their check, made out to me. Apparently, $200 was a big number 
as I was given a sweatshirt! It was a great way to spend part of the day and 
I hope to do this again next year.

Hope you had an enjoyable weekend. And thanks for your $25 contribution!
Love,
Sandy
