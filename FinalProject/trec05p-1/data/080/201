Title: Crude Oil Price Outlook after September 11

CERA's CRUDE OIL PRICE OUTLOOK

In this uncertain environment, CERA has made assumptions about how events will 
unfold in order to form a price outlook, and then has assessed the risks. 

* CERA's revised oil demand forecast is for a gain of just 0.3 million 
barrels per day (mbd) in 2002. The trend during 2002 is for a sharp year-on-
year drop in demand in the first quarter of 0.7 mbd,, followed by a 1.3 mbd 
increase in the fourth quarter as economic recovery sets in. 

* Contrasting against this message of very weak oil demand growth is CERA's 
outlook for a 1.0 mbd year-on-year gain in non-OPEC supply in 2002. 

* As a result, the potential exists for a dramatic oversupply of oil next 
year unless OPEC restrains its production. CERA's view is that OPEC continues 
to restrain production in late 2001 and 2002 in an attempt to shore up prices.
