Thresa:

Just FYI, the items below are requests of all brokers and ENA/ECT Investments, Inc. provide our own format (i.e., we do not use the broker's format).
Please forward the agreement when you receive.  Thanks.  Sara

Sara,
	We are looking to restart the process of  establishing an executing broker agreement with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.  We had temporarily put this on hold due to the WTC attack.  We have been given a new contact.  Sheila had previously already sent the memo to authorize going forward with the process.  Below are their requirements for account set up:

1.  Corporate Resolution
2.  Trading Authorization
3.  Settlement Instructions.


I am trying to get them to fax me their broker agreement.  As soon as I receive some documentation, I will forward to you.  

Thanks,
Theresa
