Gerald,

Attached is a copy of the draft Reciprocal Keep Whole language for the MMS deal. 

Also, one other Global change to the Reciprocal Keep Whole language that I have not made is that the publication for Gas Daily apparently has changed from Financial Times to Platts? I was not sure what the exact name we are supposed to use for the publication.

Judy
