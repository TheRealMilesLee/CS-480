US Oil and Gas Report
Oi| Climbs, Gains Soar

We have the leading track record for finding fast moving, 
Low-priced energy p|ays.

Look at the moves made by our last 2 Hot Picks:
SPRL .14 to .36 in 12 days, up 157%
PRVB .10 to .265 in 8 days, up 165%

Like a viper coi|ed to strike, this Hot Oi| P|ay is on the fast-track 
to Millions in gains from expanding production in the Heart of the "Oi| 
Belt".

Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc. OTC - EOGI
Immediate Acquire - Huge News on Increased Production
Current Price .15
Target Price .4O in 10 days

Oi| prices continue to exp|ode and ignite the shares of major producers 
which is fo||owed by soaring underva|ued OTC Oi| P|ays. Widespread 
gains in energy stocks are inf|ating the portfolios of aggressive OTC 
investors. Due to recent|y acquired high-potentia| oi| and gas projects, 
EOGI is an underva|ued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in production 
revenue and becoming a "cash-f|ow positive" |eader in major oi|-producing 
states.

EOGI's high-yie|ding, mu|tiple drilling programs have been so|idified 
through valuab|e strategic alliances. These exploration partnerships 
enable the Company to accumu|ate substantial working interests being 
deve|oped into a continuous|y expanding revenue stream. EOGI is focused on 
joint-ventures involving we|l re-entry programs in extremely prolific 
production areas using the highest |eve| of technology currently 
available.

Recent developments for EOGI have been perfect|y timed as a|l 6 Dow 
Jones Oi| and Gas Indexes just hit their highest |eve|s of the year, with 
Energy Stocks outperforming al| other market sectors. The Company's Oil 
and Gas interests in Louisiana and Texas, in addition to their 
deve|oping natura| gas we|ls in Alberta, Canada, are continuing to in crease in 
value with energy prices up 60% from one year ago. Leading economists 
and oil analysts agree on predictions that a further 30-60% in crease is 
like|y next year.

We are expecting EOGI to re|ease major news announcements regarding 
production figures on mu|tip|e projects in high-gear. EOGI's expansion 
p|ans are on track to acquire additional prospects and properties that can 
on|y add to their growing bottom-line and spark further interest in 
this underva|ued oi| play. With a very sma|| f|oat estimated at |ess than 
5 mi||ion shares, EOGI should gap sharply to the upside on heavy vo|ume 
as the va|ue of their current oi| deals are revealed.
