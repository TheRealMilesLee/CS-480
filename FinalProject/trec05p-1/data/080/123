 FROM THE DESK OF : MR. WANGA MBEKI 
TEL:+2348056115698 
CITIZENS INTERNATIONAL BANK PLC, 
DEVELOPMENT HOUSE MARINA 
LAGOS 

DEAR, 

PLEASE KEEP CONFIDENTIAL 

WITH DUE HONOUR AND RESPECT,I AM WANGA MBEKI 
THE MANAGER AUDIT AND ACCOUNTS UNIT, FOREIGN REMITTANCE 
DEPT. OF CITIZENS INTERNATIONAL BANK PLC. I GOT YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS 
RECOMMENDED BY A BENIN BUSINESS CONSULTANT ELDER JOHN KAFUI AND I 
DECIDED TO CONTACT YOU FOR BENEFICIAL AND A 100% RISK FREE BUSINESS 
TRANSACTION. 

DURING OUR AUDITING AND INVESTIGATIONS IN THIS BANK MY 
DEPARTMENT CAME ACROSS THE SUM OF EIGHTEEN MILLION, FIVE 
HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLAR( US$18,500.000.00) ONLY 
BELONGING TO A DECEASED CUSTOMER OF THIS BANK WHO DIED ALONG WITH HIS 
NEXT OF KIN ON 5TH NOVEMBER 2001 AEROPLANE CRASH IN ABIDJAN. BEFORE OUR DISCOVERY TO THIS DEVELOPMENT, THERE WAS NO TRACE OF CLAIM FROM ANY PERSON AS THE FUND REMAINS DORMANT IN HIS ACCOUNT WITH THIS BANK. 

ALTHOUGH I KEPT THIS INFORMATION SECRET WITHIN MYJURISDICTION TO ENABLE US PUT CLAIM AND TRANSFER THE SAID AMOUNT THROUGH A TRUSTWORTHY FRIEND OVERSEAS WHOM WE SHALL PRESENT TO THE BANK AS THE BONA FIDE NEXT-OF-KIN TO THE DECEASED FOR A PROFITABLE AND SUCCESSFUL DEAL. 

MEANWHILE ALL THE ARRANGEMENT TO PUT CLAIMS AS THE BONAFIDE 
NEXT-OF-KIN TO THE DECEASED, TO GET THE REQUIRED APPROVAL AND TRANSFER 
OF THIS MONEY TO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE. THE DIRECTIVES 
AND THE  NEEDED INFORMATION WILL BE RELAYED TO YOU AS SOON AS YOU INDICATE YOUR INTEREST AND WILLINGNESS TO THIS GREAT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. 

INFACT, WE COULD HAVE DONE THIS DEAL ALONE BUT 
BECAUSE WE CIVIL SERVANTS ARE NOT LEGALLY ALLOWED TO 
OPERATE FOREIGN ACCOUNT AND IT WOULD EVENTUALLY RAISE EYEBROWS ON OUR 
SIDE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER BECAUSE WE ARE STAFF OF THE BANK. THESE ARE THE ACTUAL REASONS IT REQUIRES A SECOND-FELLOW WHO WILL FORWAR 
CLAIMS BY OUR SUPPORT AS THE BONA FIDE NEXT-OF-KIN WITH COURT 
AFFIDAVIT TO THE BANK AND ALSO PRESENT A FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNT WHERE THE 
MONEY ON HIS/HER REQUEST WILL BE RE-TRANSFERED INTO. 

ON CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION, YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO 25% OF THE 
TOTAL SUM AS GRATIFICATION 5% OF THE TOTAL SUM WILL BE USED TO REIMBURSE 
EXPENSES THAT MIGHT ARISE FROM TELEPHONE BILLS AND OTHER EXPENSES DURING THE TRANSACTION WHILE 70% WILL BE FOR ME AND MY COLLEAGUES HERE. 

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED,PLEASE GET BACK TO ME ON MY PRIVATE AND 
CONFIDENTIAL EMAIL ADDRESS: wangambeki@citizensbankng.net  FOR MORE INFORMATION 

YOURS FAITHFULLY, 

WANGA MBEKI 
TEL:+2348056115698 

NB: 
PLEASE REPLY ME THROUGH MY ALTERNATIVE AND CONFIDENTIAL 
EMAIL :wangambeki@citizensbankng.net
