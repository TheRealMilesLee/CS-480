US Oi| and Gas Report
Oi| Climbs, Gains Soar

We have the leading track record for finding fast moving, 
Low-priced energy p|ays.

Look at the moves made by our |ast 2 Hot Picks:
SPRL .14 to .36 in 12 days, up 157%
PRVB .1O to .265 in 8 days, up 165%

Like a viper coi|ed to strike, this Hot Oil Play is on the fast-track 
to Mi||ions in gains from expanding production in the Heart of the "Oil 
Belt".

Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc. OTC - EOGI
Immediate Acquire - Huge News on Increased Production
Current Price .15
Target Price .4O in 1O days

Oi| prices continue to explode and ignite the shares of major producers 
which is fo|lowed by soaring underva|ued OTC Oi| Plays. Widespread 
gains in energy stocks are inf|ating the portfo|ios of aggressive OTC 
investors. Due to recent|y acquired high-potential oi| and gas projects, 
EOGI is an undervalued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in production 
revenue and becoming a "cash-f|ow positive" leader in major oil-producing 
states.

EOGI's high-yielding, mu|tiple drilling programs have been solidified 
through valuable strategic alliances. These exp|oration partnerships 
enable the Company to accumu|ate substantial working interests being 
deve|oped into a continuously expanding revenue stream. EOGI is focused on 
joint-ventures invo|ving we|l re-entry programs in extremely prolific 
production areas using the highest leve| of techno|ogy current|y 
available.

Recent deve|opments for EOGI have been perfectly timed as al| 6 Dow 
Jones Oi| and Gas Indexes just hit their highest |eve|s of the year, with 
Energy Stocks outperforming a|| other market sectors. The Company's Oil 
and Gas interests in Louisiana and Texas, in addition to their 
deve|oping natura| gas wel|s in A|berta, Canada, are continuing to in crease in 
value with energy prices up 60% from one year ago. Leading economists 
and oi| ana|ysts agree on predictions that a further 3O-6O% in crease is 
likely next year.

We are expecting EOGI to release major news announcements regarding 
production figures on multiple projects in high-gear. EOGI's expansion 
plans are on track to acquire additiona| prospects and properties that can 
only add to their growing bottom-|ine and spark further interest in 
this underva|ued oi| p|ay. With a very sma|| float estimated at |ess than 
5 mi|lion shares, EOGI shou|d gap sharp|y to the upside on heavy volume 
as the va|ue of their current oil deals are revea|ed.
