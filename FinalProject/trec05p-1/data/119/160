Geneva,
2 Questions:
	Is our meeting this week on Wednesday or Thursday?  I have conference rooms booked for both days.
	Do you have the matching gift form you can send me via email?  See my note below.
Thanks, LV

Lesli,
Can you please send me the matching gift form document?  I have an individual who has already begun to collect from his group and he wants to pass those out.
Thanks, LV
