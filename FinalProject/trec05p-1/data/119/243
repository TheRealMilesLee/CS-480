I have changed the dates and prices in these agreements, but those
should be the only changes necessary.  Let me know if either of you
see
any other changes that are necessary.

Brian, let's get together this afternoon and see if we can organize
our
other capacity release transactions that need to be completed by
December 1.  Does 3:00 your time work?
