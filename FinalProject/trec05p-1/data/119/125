Kevin,

I know you will find this hard to believe, but our Transaction Structure has changed once again.  We negotiated a new structure last night and I have put it on paper this morning.  Take a look and let me know if you have any questions.  I'm going to run this by Jeff and Mitch to get their confirmation and I'll let you know of any changes.
