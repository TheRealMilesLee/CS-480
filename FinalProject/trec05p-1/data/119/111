14(c) was removed because we removed Paragraph 5 - exclusivity.

I'll finalize and forward the final draft to you for forwarding to Energy Argus - unless you would prefer we do it from the Legal Dept.

I've reviewed the redline and did have one question: Why are we taking out 14(c)?

I've filled in the blanks, updated the fax numbers, and made some additional changes in Paragraph 2. 

For the time being, Net Works is still using the 1400 Smith address as everything still goes through the mail room there.

Attached are a redlined and clean version of the Information Services Agreement between ENW and Energy Argus.  The redlined version shows the modifications made to the existing Information Services Agreement with Fieldston.  There are a few blanks that need to be completed - such as the effective date (on Page 1), the "Commencement Data" (in Paragraph 2) and a fax number for Brad (in Paragraph 15).  Also, we should double check the fax number for Argus as the number listed is a Washington D.C. number.

Finally - is ENW still using the 1400 Smith Street address or has this changed?

Please take a look at the attached and let me know if you have any comments or questions.

Thanks for the patience.

Mark
