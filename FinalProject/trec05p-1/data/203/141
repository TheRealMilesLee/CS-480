"The universe is a big place, perhaps the biggest.  -- Kilgore Trout",
"Death is nature's way of saying HOWDY.", "Committees have become so important nowadays that subcommittees have to be appointed to do the work.",
"These days, the wages of sin depend on what kind of deal you make with the publisher.  -- Ivern Ball, WSJ",
"One is never disdainful of talent.  Never.  But spinelessness and meekness are harder to stomach.  Passion, vision, and ambition are what separate the agents of change from the sheep. Talent without passion/ambition is one of the most depressing/pathetic states of being.  -- Rohit Khare",
"Why did Kamikaze pilots wear helmets?", "Slightly Less Common Latin Phrase:  Fac me cocleario vomere!  Gag me with a spoon!",
"In the end, you can't tell if it happened to you, or if you just saw it on TV.  -- Slacker",
"Stupid question:  Why don't people look or talk to each other on buses and subways?",
"There is a theory which states that if ever anybody discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.  There is another theory which states that this has already happened.  -- Douglas Adams",
