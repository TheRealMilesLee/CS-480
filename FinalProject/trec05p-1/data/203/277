I just told Mitch that I might be able to get him a little more $ in the form of cash/equity and mitigate his non-compete concerns.   He asked about the title and raise and said that you suggested title was possible and probably the only way to get more $.  Is he working us?  I am OK with a VP promotion because he sure seems like some of the other VP's, but Kevin did not think he earned it.  As such, I have been trying to convince him that there is no difference between VP and Director; he is one of 15 lead marketers (half VP, half Director) and he will be compared to his peers and more importantly he will be compensated based primarily on financial performance.   
 
Bottom Line: VP with base of $150 gets him done.  I am trying to get him done with $25 cash/equity plus a $15K raise.  If you think it is better to bite the bullet and make him a VP, I am ok but we need to talk with Kevin.  
 
I know this sounds flaky, but I don't know these East guys as well as you and Kevin do so I am relying on your input.
