Dear  Friend,

I am Engr.Desmond Elliot, the chief Accountant of The Nigeria National 
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and I head a five man tender board in 
charge of contract award and payment approvals. I came to know of you 
in my search for a reliable person to handle a very confidential 
transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a 
foreign account.

There were series of contracts executed by a consorting of 
multinationals in the oil industry in favor of Nigeria National 
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) among which were for the following:

1. The expansion of the pipelines network within for a crude down 
stream products distribution and subsequent evacuation, which cost 
$8bUSD(8 Billion United States Dollars).
2. Contract for the turn around maintenance (TAM) of the various 
Refineries in the country $115 million United States Dollars.
3. The construction of storage tanks for petroleum products (depots) 
$190 Million United States Dollars.

The original value of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced 
in the sum $39mUSD (Thirty nine Million United States Dollars Only) 
which has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred, being 
that the companies that actually executed these Contracts had been 
fully paid when the projects were officially commissioned.

It does not matter whether your company did the contract or not, the 
assumption is that your company won the major contract and sub-
contracted it out to other companies. Consequently, my colleagues and I 
are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent 
disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of 
conduct bureau (civil service laws) from opening and or operating 
foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust imposed on 
you at this junction is enormous. 

In return, we have agreed to offer you 30% of the transferred sum, the 
remaining 70% is for us, the Nigerian officials.Modalities have been 
worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the 
central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the fund within 
14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms.

Our assurance is that your role is risk free, I accord this transaction 
the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the fund, the whole 
approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with the 
name of any company you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary of the 
above mentioned amount.Therefore, when the business is successfully 
concluded we shall through our same connections withdraw all documents 
used from all the concerned government ministries for 100% security 
risk free. Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 
21 years in the civil service of my country, I am very careful to have 
my image and career deemed.

One blank letterhead, one invoice sheet and your bank particulars 
through my above address, as time is not on our side in the business.

Send by Email for security reasons: desliot@lmxmail.sk

Thanks as I wait in anticipation for your fullest co-operation.
Very truly yours,

Engr.Desmond Elliot
