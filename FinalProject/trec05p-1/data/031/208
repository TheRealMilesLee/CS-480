Rick - 
I am seeking to help a friend-of-a-friend who has squamous cell carcinoma in his nasal passage.  It sounds familiar - is it the same as your diagnosis in a different location?   If not, pls. ignore.   If so, who do you see at MD Anderson as your primary doctor? Thanks for your help.  
Separately, I hope you are doing very well.  I am forwarding info about an amazing conference put on by the Anderson Network.  I have been active for some years, and my husband and I are sponsoring the closing speaker, Ron Bliss (cancer survivor and 6 1/2 year VietNam POW).   It would entail a day off, but is extremely worthwhile.  See attached webpage (note "Living Fully with Cancer" conference on right hand of 1st page).  
I look forward to hearing from you.  Take care, Paula
