Dear Friend , 
I am Dr. Mrs. Mariam Abacha, wife to the late Nigerian Head 
of state, General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 
1998 while still on active service for our Country. 
l am contacting you with the hope that you will be of great 
assistance to me, I currently have within my reach the sum 
of 24 million U.S dollars cash which l intend to use for 
investment purposes outside Nigeria. 
This money came as a result of a payback contract deal 
between my husband and a Russian firm in our country?s 
multi-billion dollar Ajaokuta steel plant. The Russian 
partners returned my husbands share being the above sum 
after his death. Presently, the new civilian Government has 
intensified their probe into my husbands financial 
resources which has led to the freezing of all our 
accounts, local and foreign, the revoking of all our 
business licences and the arrest of my First son. 
In view of this I acted very fast to withdraw this money 
from one of our finance houses before it was closed down. I 
have deposited the money in a security company with the 
help of very loyal officials of my late husband. No record 
is known about this fund by the government 
because there is no documentation showing that we received 
such funds. Due to the current situation in the country and 
government attitude to my family, I cannot make use of this 
money within, thus I seek your help in transferring this 
funds out of the sub-African region. 
Bearing in mind that you may assist me, l have decided to 
part with 20% of the total sum. Your URGENT response is 
needed. 
Please kindly reply me with mariambb@e-milio.com
Please include your personal phone and fax number. 
Regards, 
Dr. Mrs. Mariam Abacha,
