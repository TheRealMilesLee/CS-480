Let's plan on getting together on Friday A.M. Aug 31./01. 9:00 AM 

Stephanie and I will be in the office anyways.  In terms of a formal agenda.. Really there is nothing that pressing. An overview of what is going on from regulatory's perspective and the relationship to gas would be very helpful.

Greetings:
Any idea of when you'll be coming to California? And have you folks put any thoughts down on paper that you can share at this point?  Thanks.

Best,
