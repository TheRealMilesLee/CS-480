Hello all. Kimberly was too efficient and sent this out before I had a chance to call you.  We have a new Associate who recently joined our group. He is new to Enron and will be helping with our "Producer Focus" efforts. Since we sell a number of products (including some of yours), I  would like to request 30 minutes to an hour for you (or someone else in your group) to spend with Shauywn telling him about your business and how your group works with us. Kimberly will be getting with you to set up a time if you are available. Thank you for your assistance and time. I appreciate it.
