Hi,

	This is to inform everyone that we will be gathering for a happy hour at Cafe Adobe this Friday Feb 1,2002.  We plan to be there right after work from 5:00pm till 7:00pm.  It is located at Westheimer Rd and Kirby (2111 Westheimer Rd, 713-528-1468).  There is plenty of parking on the street and in a few parking lots but it does get quite busy during happy hour.  The drinks are reasonably priced and there are nachos and finger foods.
Please forward this e-mail to anyone that might want to join us including colleagues/spouse/friends.

Thanks,
Kevin
