Since 99% of the deals that we did in Calgary were financial, one of the biggest problems we encountered was the last day of true ups at month end. Because we cannot capture the last day of the month right now, as the volume of financial deals grow (assuming it will), it is possible we could be dealing with fairly large PMA adjustments. 

We may need to start thinking about a way that we could capture these numbers.
