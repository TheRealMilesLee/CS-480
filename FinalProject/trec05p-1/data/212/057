Is it okay if I get Jesse(our clerk) to pack your files?  I want to confirm what you wanted packed.  All files except your EOL files.  Does this mean all binders in bookcases as well in your cabinets?

Is it okay to tell people that are calling for you that you are in London?  I told Pat O'Donnell you were in London but reachable.

Also,  do you want someone to sit in for me while I'm out?  I talked to Liz and she thought she would be fine but I wanted to check with you.
