I do know that. Take care. Please let me know when you do come up to NYC. I
will keep my eyes open as far as that goes. Eddie

Eddie,

Thanks for the note. This morning I signed my contract with UBS, so I am
here for another year. After that I will be wanting to move the family back
to the NYC area. If you hear of anyone interested in someone where my skills
would be a fit, let me know. Otherwise things are going okay and we hope to
start trading again by mid feb. Hope all is well with you and your family.
I'll let you know next time I am in NYC. Give me a call when you get a
chance and thanks again for the support. I hope you know I would do the same
for you.

Andy
