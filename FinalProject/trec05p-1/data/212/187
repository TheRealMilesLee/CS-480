Hunter/Fletch,

Danielle Marcinkowski in the market data group has been discussing a new arrangement with PIRA.  I was told by the legal group that all contracts with parties such as PIRA need to be negotiated through the market data group.  FYI there were outstanding issues in the bankruptcy surrounding the display of reports/data on our website to users that did not have licenses (mainly EGM).  

All that said, we need the Weekly Gas Flash, US Gas Market Forecast, Western Gas Basis Report, and the Daily Electricity report.  We would also like to be able to phone PIRA reps with questions, participate in strategic breifings, and have two slots for the PIRA annual energy conference.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Chris

Fellas,

Presto has asked me to be the contact to Allan Stewart at PIRA with regard to setting up an arrangement for their consulting services.  I'm currently having information-gathering discussions over services and fees for both gas and power, in both the east and west.  In order to fully incorporate everyone's needs into our arrangement with PIRA, I'll be contacting you this week to gather requests.  Or, if you know what you need, please just reply to me with the specific information.

Thanks,

Fletch
