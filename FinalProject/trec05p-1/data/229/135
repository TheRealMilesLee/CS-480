"Men, all the banter is appreshe 8-ted and good.  However, (once again) there has been only talk of noncents, and noone has respanded to the proposol regarding dinner. I therefoar suggest rsvp by toomarrrough."

Men:

Hunting season is over. It is now working season. All email threads are
gone. No one talks to one another. This is wrong.

I therefor propose man night February 28th, 2002 at some location yet to be
determined, such as Tony's mexican food...on Ella.
