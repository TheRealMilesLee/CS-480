Dear Friend,

I am Mrs. SESE-SEKO widow of late President Mobutu Sese-Seko of Zaire now =
known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this =
letter in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation.

I escape along with my husband and two of our sons KENNEDY and BASHER, out of =
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Cote D=92Ivoire where my =
family and I settled for a while and later moved to Morocco where died of =
cancer. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my =
husband=92s billions of dollars deposit in Swiss banks and other countries =
into other forms of money coded for safe purpose. This is because the new =
Head of State of DRC, Mr. Lauren Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss =
government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband=92s =
treasures deposited in some European countries. Hence my children and I =
decided to lay low in Africa to study the situation till when things get =
better. Like now that President Lauren Kabila and the son (Joseph Kabila) has =
taken over. One of my late husband=92s Chateaux in southern France was =
confiscated by the French government and as such I had to change my identity =
so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.

I have deposited the sum of eighteen million Fourty Five Thousand United =
States dollars (US$18,045,000.00) with a security company for safekeeping. =
The funds are security coded to prevent them from knowing the content. What I =
want you to do are to indicate your interest that you will assist us by =
receiving the money on our behalf. Acknowledge this message, so that I can =
introduce you to my son (KENNEDY) who has worked out the modalities for the =
claim of the said funds.

I want you to assist in investing this money without my identity being =
revealed. I will also want to buy properties and stock in multi-national =
companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments.

May I at this point emphasize the high level of confidentiality which this =
business demands and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence which =
I repose in you.

In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son shall put you in the picture =
of the business and tell you where the funds are currently being maintained =
and also discuss other modalities including remuneration for your services.

For this reason, kindly furnish us your contact information, including your =
personal phone and fax number for confidential purpose and acknowledge the =
receipt of this mail.

Best regards,
 
MRS M. SESE SEKO
