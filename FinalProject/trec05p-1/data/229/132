RE: MID-CONTINENT 3rd QUARTER PRODUCTION REPORT

Lippman Consulting, Inc. has just completed the Mid-Continent Quarterly 
Production Report for the third quarter of 2001. Mid-Continent region is 
second only to the Gulf Coast Region in providing natural gas supplies for 
this country. The region includes the following basins: the Anadarko Basin, 
the Arkoma Basin, and the Fort Worth Basin with the extensive 
Hugoton-Panhandle area. The Mid-Continent region included in this region are 
the states of Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Districts 7B, 9, and 10 in the 
state of Texas. The report contains drilling programs by operator, rig 
activities as well as gas production volumes. Historical production volumes 
are reported both annually and quarterly and displayed both tabular and 
graphically.
