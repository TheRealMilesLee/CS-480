Audrey,

Per our telephone conversation, I will be glad to work with you to correct the access problems with data still being accessible by NNG's personnel over in Dynegy's offices.  If you are able to provide the names of the specific folders in question, I can provide a list of who currently has access and then update the security for those folders.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me at 713-853-7707 (office) or 877-678-3092 (pager).

Thanks,

glenda wagner
ETS Information Risk Management (Houston)

Audrey, I'm forwarding your message to Scott Abshire.  Scott's group has been responsible for the "shared drive" efforts.  He will be able to assign someone to take care of this.  Thanks.

Lisa, Steve Harris suggested I share with you our concerns on the subject of "Shared Drives".  We had some problems on last week with deleted files on the TW_NNG Shared Drive -"S".  The Help Desk has resolved these problems, but in the process, we noticed that some of the files on the shared drive were still being viewed and updated by NNG's personnel over in Dynegy's offices.  

Our concerns are such that some files should be viewed only by ETS, specifically TW.   Would you please check on this concern as soon as possible?

If you would, please update me on the status of this request.  If you have additional questions concerning this problem, please do not hesitate to call me (x35849).  

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention.
