Jim started cautiously along the way, Zeb driving while the Wizard and
Dorothy each held a lighted lantern so the horse could see where to

the sides; then it would broaden out as wide as a street; but the floor was
usually smooth, and for a long time they travelled on without any accident

You must say nothing, while he is with us, about certain marks that will
appear upon his forehead; but when he has gone I will explain those marks so
you will understand them
