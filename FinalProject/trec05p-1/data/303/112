My Dear Friend,
Kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail
to you,i have choosen to call you my friend with best
of hope that you will have a very kind heart so full
of consciences,love considering human nature to be
able to understand my situation and help me find a
solution and rescue over this my incident because you
seem to be my last hope for now.

I believe you are a highly respected personality
considering a careful research which i have been able
to make inrespect to your kind of person,before i
decided to entrust this transactions and database in
your country into your hands which i beleive you will
not betray my trust and confidence already repossed on
you.

Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar
with events and fragile political situation in Liberia
but it has formed consistent headlines in the CNN, BBC
news bulletins.
My name is WILLSON NUHAN VAYE from Liberia,a Country in
West
Africa.My Father is Issac Nuhan Vaye, Deputy Minister
of Public Works,Liberia.

My Father was falsely accused of plotting to remove
the then PRESIDENT
OF LIBERIA (CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without
trial, Charles Taylor killed him. You can verify this
from your country. You can also check in some of the
international newspapers
posted in the web sites below:
(i)
http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-07-15-liberia_x.htm
(ii)http://www.unwire.org/UNWire/20030716/449_6621.asp

Before my father was killed, he moved out the sum of
$4.7million(Four Million Seven Hundred Thousand US
Dollars) through a diplomatic means, and deposited it
with a
Security Company overseas.

My mother who is still under very strict suveillance
by the security and government of my country had
agreed that we look for a reliable trust worthy person
who can help us out hence i decided to contact you.

At the moment am residing here in Spain in disquise in
an ayslum camp and with my statues as an asylum,it
does not permit to enter into such transaction of a
huge magnitude otherwise i may be suspected and run
into trouble which might result to my being deported
back to LIBERIA.

All that is needed is for you to agree in helping me
then i shall give you vivid details through my lawyer
to instruct the company to transfer the funds to your
account, I will renumerate you with 30% at the end,
but most of all is that I solicit your trust in this
transaction i know this sounds too good to be true,but
beleive me,that my you shall not in anyway be expossed
to danger or ridicule because the continued existence
of my family solely depends on ensuring that i get a
partner who will truely assist me in securing the
money in safe hands before it is been discovered and
confisticated by the authorities of my country.

My mother ever since has been confined only to our
country home and all her calls are being monitored,but
you can always reach me personally on my mobil phone
which i shall send across to you as soon as you
indicate your interest,so for now i will advise you to
contact me through my personal email address for
confidential reasons(willsonvaye@yahoo.com).

kindly include your private telephone and fax
numbers/residential address where you can
always be reached if you are in the need to help me to
enable me send detail information/documents to you.

Once more,i will appreciate you keep this information
and transaction strictly confidential even if you are
not interested to save me from the risk of running
into trouble as this the only way i can cry out for
help through any reasonable and responsible christian
or devote muslism who will rescue my situation.

MAY GOD/ALLAH BLESS YOU.
