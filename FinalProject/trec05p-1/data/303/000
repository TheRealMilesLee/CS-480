You have an electronic contract awaiting your review and execution.  Use the Execute Electronic Contracts screen to print and electronically execute a Request(s) for service                      

To Print/Execute Electronic Contracts: 

1. Click on the Contracts folder       
2. Select the Execute Electronic K from the Contract Administration Drop Down menu                                                                          
3. Select the service requester from the Service Requester drop down menu
4. Choose the print option of either View Later or E-mail.
 4a. If View Later is selected then the contract can be printed from the Utility
     folder: View Report Selection
 4b. If Email is selected then the contract will be emailed to the address  
     displayed in the Email Address Field. This field will default to the email
     address currently associated with the Navigator Id that is currently logged
     on the system. You may change the designation of where the contract is 
     to be sent by typing in a different email address                      
5. Click on Retrieve                   
6. To print a contract, place a check in the Print Contract select box beside the Bid/Request No. that you want to print                                    
7. To execute your contract, place a check in the Execute select box beside the Bid/Request No. that you want to execute. Note: It is strongly recommended that you print your contract prior to execution. You can select the print option independent of the execution option; that way you may review the printed contract then if the terms were agreeable, return to this screen to execute the contract                                                                       
8. Click on Submit.                    
 8a. After the contract is executed the screen will display the contract      
     number assigned and the date it was executed                             
 8b. The executed contract information will be displayed on the screen for one
     full day following the date it was executed                              

Note only those Navigator Ids with execution authority may electronically execute a contract. The contract must be executed before the "Execute by Date" expires.
