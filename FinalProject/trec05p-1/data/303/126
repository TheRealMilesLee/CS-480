Hi guys,
I spoke with the attorney for DRI, a producer on TCO.  He said that he
would convince his client not to file a motion in the bankruptcy court
for amounts owed for post petition production volumes delivered to
ENA,IF ENA sends him a letter by next Friday, 6/28/02, stating
definitively that ENA will pay DRI for such volumes and a date certain
by which the payment will be made to DRI.
