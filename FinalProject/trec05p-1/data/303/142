Hello-

For my own use, I put together the attached list of outstanding DMS requests and plan to do so at the end of each week.  

It occurred to me that perhaps this spreadsheet would be a helpful tool for all of you to see as well.  

If you have any additions/corrections (my apologies for any mistakes!), please let me know.  
Also, please let me know if you would like me to forward to you an updated spreadsheet like this on a weekly basis.

Note:  I only pulled "Need Further Documentation" requests from bankruptcy forward.

Thanks!

Jenny
