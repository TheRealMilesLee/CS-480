I was talking to Anita this morning and she was asking me if I knew what
games we were going to at spring training - she heard an ad or something for
it and it made it sound fun.  I think they are trying to decide what to do
for Spring Break.  They me be planning a Florida Trip.  What should I be
telling her????  So far I have been very vague about it, but at some point
I'm going to have to be more specific.  I don't want to hurt her feelings,
but I'd rather not spend the whole trip with them.
