   Last week we had our annual Links meeting in Liberal to go over upcoming outages this summer and coordinate them with Mobile & OXY (well testing) and Oneok ( field compression & Bushton Plant). The goal of the Links meeting is to improve communications and coordinate outage so that we can have the least amount of throughput loss for all. We also discuss any ideas that can be improved on. One idea that Mobile brought up is they would like to call into gas control in the morning around 6:30 to 7:00  and get an update of any outages during the night in the Hugoton area that may have caused them to be short on gas. They need this information so they can report in their marketing meeting so they can adjust noms. So if the central controller could start making notes of any outages in Hugoton during the night that affected flow and pass them on to the day crew they would have this information to pass on and not have to look it up. This would be very helpful for Mobile. They may not call every morning but we need to have the information when they do.

Thanks 
Gary
