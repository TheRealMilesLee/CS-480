Oh every politician is posturing.......unfortunately the republicans as well.
The politicians screaming the loudest and making the claims of criminality, 
are the same ones who defeated Arthur Levitt [former SEC head] proposals to 
put strong teeth in accounting standards and not allow consulting by your 
accountant.   

My concern is if Cooper doesn't see lots of people he'll think we are all 
just swimming in cash and don't need severance.
