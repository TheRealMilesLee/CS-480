Attached is a draft demand letter for nonpayment.  This form is specifically geared to the ISDA.  Please comment.  Do you think we need a "savings clause" for deals which we might inadvertently fail to mention, the date by which payment is required, or a telephone contact for questions?

We are collecting the data for a rash of these letters.  

Thanks.  Sara
