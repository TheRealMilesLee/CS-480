informative and productive meeting.  Never fear however; we assigned you
all jobs in absentia!  If you were wondering, there is still plenty to
do towards our goal of making our neighborhood the most fabulous in
town.  Any little bit of effort that you can contribute is well
appreciated and often leads to fun and getting to know your wonderful
neighbors.

There has been much talk and messaging about reviving the once vital,
now dormant Citizen Patrol.  It now time to put your money where your
mouth is.  We have received the necessary information and materials from
Officer Roeder and plan to make this the focus of our March EMCA
meeting.

This is the procedure for starting up our own patrol:

-- You must express interest by replying to this e-mail.
-- You must attend the March meeting which will also be the Citizen
Patrol
      Introduction Meeting.
-- You must sign the Citizen Patrol Introduction Meeting Roster.

If enough people show interest, attend the meeting, and sign the roster
which we will turn in to Officer Roeder, we will all then receive an
official training from HPD.

So if you want to see the return of the Citizen Patrol, now is the time
to act.  There you have it.

Hope to see you around and next month.

Jaimie Evans V.P. EMCA
