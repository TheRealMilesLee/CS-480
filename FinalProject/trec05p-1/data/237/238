Just thought I'd let you know I had several people drop by my office today.  They all said they heard you had found a new opportunity and would be leaving us in the near future.

Normally I dispel the rumor and move on, but this came from so many different individuals I wanted you to be aware of the hallway discussion.

I enjoy our working relationship, so selfishly I hope this rumor isn't merited...
