Welcome to our little corner of the world!   You'll love living here; we're
quite an eclectic bunch, and pert-near everyone is quite friendly.  The area
has much to offer, too, in the way of restaurants, shopping, entertainment,
and even recreation (if you happen to favor biking along scenic bayous on
not-so-well-maintained paths).

It's cool you've already signed on to our website.  It'll keep you up to
date on going-on.  You learn a lot about the people who live here, too.

Be sure to introduce yourself when you're out and about, and come to our
meetings the third Tuesday of each month.

Julie Young
Stanford & Drew
