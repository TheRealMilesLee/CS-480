Hi guys.  It's nearing that time again.

I'm getting ready to put together the EMCA newsletter, so if there's
anything you'd like put in there, please let me know.  Anything (almost)
goes.... restaurant reviews, new business notices, interesting people, lost
pets, for sales, etc.

I'll need it by the second week of March.  Please remember that everything
ends up being edited for content and length... There's so much going on
around here that it's hard to squeexe everything into the newsletter!

Put it in my mailslot, leave a message on my machine (up to 4 minutes), or
e-mail me.
