                                        STRICTLY SECRET 
AND CONFIDENTIAL

Dear Friend,


Compliments of the day. I deceided to contact you after I received a worthy information about your reliability and honesty. Hence I confide in you.


I am Dr Joy Titus,from (AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK),Republic of Benin.During the course of our auditing we discovered the sum of twelve million five hundred thousand united states dollars (USD$12.500.000.00) floating in an account opened in this Bank since 1997 and as from 2001 nobody has operated on this account again, and after going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of the account died without a [HEIR]sept 11th 2001 by plane crash, hence the money is floating.

After due verification I noticed that no other person knows about this account except his wife who was also invovled in the crash, and the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that untill his death he was the Director GOLD ARK [SARL] Since our bank,(African Development Bank)Benin Rep.got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come forward and claim his money because we
cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and policies but up to date nobody came up to this bank as his next of kin or relative.


It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or elation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming forth and we don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. On this note, I decided to
seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin as no one has come up as his relation.

And the country law here does not allow such money to stay more than Five years, for the  money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this period. Upon the receipt of your response, I will send to you the application form, bank's contact and the next step to take. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you
should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within fourteen banking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the deceased.


It has been resolved that 30% will be for you while 10% has been maped out to defray any expences that might be incured during the process of the ransaction. Then 60% will be for me which shall be release after the funds must have been remitted into your bank account.

When you receive this letter, kindly send me an e-mail signifying your decision.Including
your private

1.Your Full name /adddress .
2.Telephone number.
3. Fax numbers .

for quick communication. I will be very happy if you can treat this business with the utmost secrecy it demands because of my position in this bank.

Hoping for a very successful business relationship with you.

Best Regards,

Dr Joy Titus
