Neighbors:

I have agreed to organize EMCA's first annual Easter Egg Hunt, and am hoping that I can look to the egroup to get some volunteers and ideas.

The Hunt will be held at the pocket park in the 700 block of Bomar, on Saturday, March 23, from 9:00 to 10:30 in the morning.  All children accompanies by an EMCA resident will be welcome to participate.  

I don't know how many interested parents/children we will have, as this is our first year; we will use the newsletter to advertise the Hunt to the neighborhood, so that we can try to be sure to have enough goodies ready.

In the meantime, if anyone is up for volunteering time and help, I would love to hear from you.
