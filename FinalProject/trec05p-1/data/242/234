   2.  The  condition  of disgrace suffered as a result of public
   blame, abuse, or condemnation; ill repute.

     There  he  remained,  weeping  indignantly at her stream of
     obloquy,  bitterly  ashamed of his tears, until it was time
     for supper.
     --Jonathan Keates, [1]Stendhal

     Once  installed  in office he earned near-universal obloquy
     by  pushing through the biggest tax increase in the state's
     history.
     --Dan  Seligman, "The Taxophiliacs," [2]Forbes, February 5,
     2001

     For  Britain  to  have  made  a  last imperial stand on the
     shores  of  the  South  China  Sea  would have risked local
