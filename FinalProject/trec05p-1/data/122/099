Leslie -

There was a correction to the Reliant collateral annex that we made on Thursday afternoon after you had already left.  The "Rounding Amount" and "Minimum Transfer Amount" were both shown as $25,000 but should have been $250,000.

I made the correction to the electronic version and we have sent the revised hard copies to Reliant.  Please call me with any questions.
