I am Mrs Hilok Berdsk, widow to Mr Gorjacisk Berdsk, My
Late Husband was a Petroleum Engineer who worked and
jointly owned an Oil field with the Present Equatorial
Guinea Minister for Industry, Commerce and Small
Enterprises Mr Nsue Constantino Ekong, along with
Amerada Hess, Tullow Oil and GE Petrol.

My Husband and I arrived in Equatorial Guinea in 1996
after the discovery of oil along Gabon Border; through
friends of my Husband he acquired Oil field and
started the exploration of oil in the Zafiro Oil field
until January 26th this year when he died.

He was a trained Engineer, he dedicated his life to
helping the underprivileged here in Equatorial Guinea,
He built a Hospital that cared for Orphanages and for
treatment of the sick where Government Hospitals were
deficient, he was very dedicated to God, we had one
child (Yakutsk) until he died of prostrate Cancer
Yakutsk and i are living in Guinea now. From money
made at his Hospital and Oil exploration, he had the
intension to set up a Foundation/Clinic for the care
for Heart disease and Cancer patients until death
struck, he had already had the money (the sum of
US$3.2Million) transferred by his Bank in Equatorial
Guinea (FIRST NATIONAL BANK) to a Bank in Europe where
he was to buy the medical facilities for the
construction of the Foundation and Clinic.

As his Cancer situation deteriorated we visited The
University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Centre in
Texas USA, his health situation worsened when we
arrived home in Equatorial Guinea and died a month
later January 26th 2005.He willed much of his
Properties including the US$3.2Million deposited at
the Bank in Europe to me and Melissa, his other Clinic
and Orphanage home in Ceiba-a town here in Zafiro,
were willed to the local Residents under the care of
local municipalities.

I sought for an honest Humanitarian or a believer in
helping me transfer the money to an account in Russia.
I have the intention to go back home and start
life there.but with the political power and total
economy contorl of the Russia Goverment and now that 
my Husband is dead. I could settle
in your Country, but the realization that I do not
have the legal status to reside there or own an
account urged me to contact you for assistance.

I shall notify the Bank in Europe where my Late
Husband deposited the money that I shall nominate a
trustee, who will contact them for claim of the fund,
please let me know if you can be of help. We can also
agree on investment if we reach an agreement
considering that you have experience in Petroleum Oil
and Gas.

sincerely,

Mrs Hilok Berdsk.
