Hi Sally, Michelle,
 
Attached is the expanded/revised deal data for the banker presentation. The daily deal counts listed are based on averages for the months of August, September and October. 
 
The tenor information provided in the boxes to the right compare average EOL and OTC tenor for the last trading week to the average tenors during the same week last month.
 
Just let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information.
 
Thanks,

Torrey Moorer
