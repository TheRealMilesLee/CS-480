 We are dedicated to providing cutting-edge medicine through Internet technology.
Our physicians specialize in consulting with privacy-minded individuals and prescribing popular medications.
These medications, sometimes called "embarrassment" drugs, are prescribed and dispensed by our physicians and pharmacists!

Isn't a physical exam needed to determine if you would benefit from these medications?
If you have had a physical exam recently and consider yourself healthy, you do not necessarily require another physical exam in order for you to obtain the medications we offer.
Thousands of psychiatrists and general practitioners throughout the US are prescribing certain medications after only reviewing the patient’s medical history, without a physical exam.
The medical factors that would prohibit a physician from prescribing these medications are discoverable through a review of the patient's medical history.
There is no reason to suggest that an in-person review of this history is any more relevant than an online consultation.

As our patient, you are able to:

    * Enjoy complete privacy, discretion, and dignity while addressing your condition.
    * Play an active role and participate more fully in your own process of care.
    * Enjoy your health care in an enlightened manner and maintain better health.
    * Enjoy a professional consultation at an affordable cost.
