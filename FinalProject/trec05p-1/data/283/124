We have reached an agreement with JP Morgan Chase that allows us to remain in the Enron Building through March 31, 2003.  JP Morgan and other lending banks that hold the lease on this building may choose to take administrative actions to protect their rights in the bankruptcy proceedings, including foreclosing on the entity created to hold the lease.  However, this action would not impact our agreement with JP Morgan to remain in the building.  Under the agreement, we will pay taxes and rent for our office space through March of next year and make up all back taxes and rent.  We will continue to review the company's office requirements and evaluate all of our space options early next year.
