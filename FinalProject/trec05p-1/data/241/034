Oh, just a little teaser for the group.  Believe me, they all just think
it's me being my usual weird, nonsensical self.

Do you want the picture you sent me?

Had fun. Glad to see everyone at the Hybrid man night. Reported to Zander,
who was glad to hear we enjoyed the food. Joe that was not a TV dinner.
We still need to take care of the deer lease food/beer issues. ....whenever.
FYI John (Wollam) is fine. Has a pulled muscle in his neck.
Enjoyed eating eyes, eye socket fatty tissue, head meat, talking about how
much I care for my dog, eating heart meat, men playing with their meat, 
bowel distress and "grapes" and seeing how it played out for the one MAN 
audience.
I doubt Dave Wieland will join us again and Ted will likely be asked to turn

down the next invitation to join us by his friend.
I give the food an A+, service was also excellent. Chad gets the award for
being most "in" to the effort.
I will mark my calendar for 60 days to rip a thread for the next effort. e.
