I understand your pain.  We are just stating what has been told to us by
the Gas Control group.

The answers to your questions are as follows:

1) The OFO will probably be in effect until sometime on Monday.

2) The Tenaska IV Texas Partners contract is very old and was written
before TXU LSP put hourly swing imbalance penalty provisions in the
Electric Generation contracts.   The main remedy for TXU LSP in the
contract is to physically resrict flow to the power plant to stay even with
gas receipt volumes or to demand that the power plant bring in receipt gas
to meet its burn.

I hope this helps.

Jeff:

The problem with all of the power plants is that somebody has to swing on
load to follow the electric profile. This may be us.

Also, how long is this OFO going to be in place??

Secondly, namely because I haven't thoroughly read the contract, what are
the imbalance penalties??

Thanks for the load profile.  The official word is still that TXU LSP is
requesting that all power plants stay as even as possible on their hourly
pulls with respect to their nominations.
