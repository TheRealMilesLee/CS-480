deansters have i missed something today - did dean say something about his bro to this effect or was this just another nasty swipe at dean?
- icelandic painter s recent oil paintings on wood panel images include seascapes landscapes and semi-abstract works.
senator edwards has kept on his message and has not in the main gone negative he may or may not be a v-p choice but he s one fine gentleman in the best sense of the word.
politronic chatter picked up by pundits monitoring lefty blogsites and al-gora intercepts flashes the warning if stopped dean may well bolt.
then during the general campaign when bush says we got saddam dean can say no x y and z captured saddam you destroyed our foreign policy.
i feel like a lot of gephardt people are union people who just don t feel there is anyone else in the race for them.
this is in reply to dean blows sam in san diego here comes a thirty dollar contribution to the troll goal go dean!
so if you want to win british hearts and minds this week do so by being frank and honest with the people s paper.
