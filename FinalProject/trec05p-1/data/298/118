From Gladdys christenn
Permit me to inform you of my desire to live with you as well as 
having sound business orientation through your guidance. I am the 
only child of late Dr and Mrs Linda christenn My father was a very 
wealthy cocoa merchant based in Abidjan, the economic capital of Cote 
D'Ivoire before he was poisoned to death by his business associates 
on one of their trips to discuss business. When my mother died on the 
21st October 1984, I became so close to my father as the only child 
till that fateful day that death took him away from me. While on his 
bedside on 24th November 2003 in a private hospital in Abidjan, he 
secretly revealed to me that during the war in my country, he moved 
the sum of US$12,500,000 (Twelve Million Five Hundred thousand United 
States Dollars) and deposited with a security company abroad.
Before his death, his last words was that I should move to Ghana 
where his enemies will not know my whereabout,while in Ghana, I must 
find any possible means of moving out and nationalize in a foreign 
country where I can put up a solid investment with the money through 
a wise assistance of a matured and trustworthy person so that I will 
not lack anything as his only daughter,which I promised him before 
his last breath. Now, I am staying here in a village in Kumasi Ghana 
with a teacher and his family. Though they are poor but the teacher 
and the wife is very caring. However,with my father's desire in my 
mind to seek for a foreign guardian outside West Africa region where 
the money will be used for investment purposes, (Such as Real Estate 
management) as well as living a safe life.
I am honourably seeking your assistance in the following way:(1) To 
serve as my guardian(2) Assist me in safekeeping the fund by 
accepting to receive it from the security company with a letter of 
authority from me. (3) to make arrangement for me to come over to 
your country to continue my education and to secure a residential 
permit for me in your country. Once the fund is in your custody and 
you also make it possible for me to live in your country under your 
care with the fund, I am willing to offer you a negotiable percentage 
of 15% for your efforts/input,while you will be a partner in the 
investment of the fund.
Please, indicate your interest towards assisting me as I believed 
that this transaction would be concluded within few days.
Anticipating hearing from you immediately. Thanks and God bless you. 
Gladdys christenn
