  Belgian energy group Tractebel has won a large electricity contract in
the US. Tractebel will manage all electricity acquisitions of US
electricity distributor Niagara Mohawk Corporation, which has a customer
base of 1.5 million in the north of New York State. The value of the
contract has not been revealed.

  Temi, Tractebel's US electricity trading and sales division, will
supply 35,000 gigawatt hours of electricity to the US distributor. In
comparison: total Belgian electricity usage amounted to 75,000 gigawatt
hours in the year 2000. Niagara's customer base includes both private
and industrial users. Temi is taking over all current contracts for
electricity supply to Niagara.
