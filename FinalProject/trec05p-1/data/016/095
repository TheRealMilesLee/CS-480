Could you please set up these books so I am able to set-up the counterparty alternative.  Thanks for your help this week! TARA

Tara,

Andy's books are as follows:

NG-X-OPT-NG (gas)
NG-X-OPT-WTI (crude)
NG-X-OPT-PWR (power)

Let's use the natural gas book as the one he logs in under.

Thanks,

Errol, X5-8274
