You signed up through ELM Training Website to register for the Access 2000, Introduction class, however, that class was already full and you were placed on the waitlist or showed interest.  I have the September calendar ready and I want to make sure that you have a seat in this class.  I am going to leave you on the waitlist for the August 09th class (just in case we have cancellations) however, I want to make sure that you sign up for the one in September.  The next available class is:
September 13th	8:30am-4:00pm or
September 19th	8:30am-4:00pm

Please let me if you would like for me to preregister you into this class.The September classes have not been posted on the website yet.  Your answer will be greatly appreciated. A seat will not be guaranteed for September if you do not respond.  Please select one of the dates above and respond back to this message.

Thanks for your help and understanding.
