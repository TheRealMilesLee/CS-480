Untangle Financial Jargon

By Colleen Bazdarich
http://www.business2.com/siteunseen?nl=su


Companies' quarterly conferences are now open to investors. But
listening in, you might very well suspect that bigwig executives and
Wall Street analysts are using esoteric lingo to confuse matters. Next
time you're feeling left out, consult InvestorWords.com's copious
directory, which houses more than 5,000 definitions to help you decode a
company's latest earnings announcement or press release.

Browse through the dictionary by alphabetical list, or search for a
specific word. The coolest thing about this site: Each definition is
densely hyperlinked so that, within each entry, every word that's listed
elsewhere in the dictionary gets a link to its own definition. If you
look up Ebitda, for example, you'll find hyperlinks to each of the
financial terms that make up the acronym: earnings, interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization.

If you find the size of the InvestorWords database overwhelming, check
out the glossary pages, which contain definitions for more specific
subjects, from accounting to venture capital.
