<P>Dear Mr. Ball, </P>
<P>STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL </P>
<P>Although,i have not prior to this letter had any formal contact or
communication with you,however,your business contact was personally sourced
by me in my</P>
<P>quest for a reliable Foreign Company,Investor,Business man,or partner to
assist with an urgent business deal requiring utmosttrust and
confidentiality.</P>
<P>I am Mr.James Rawilngs., The manager, Bills and Exchange at the Foreign
Remittance Department of the Eco Bank Plc. I am writing this Letter to ask
for your support and cooperation to carry out this business Opportunity in
my department. We discovered an abandoned sum of $24,500,000.00 (Tewty Four
Million United States Dollars only) in an account that belongs to one of our
foreign customers who died along with his entire Family of a wife and two
children in November 1997 in a Plane crash in Cotonun -Republic Of
Benin.</P>
<P>Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next-of-kin to
come over and put claims for his money as the heir, because we cannot
release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the
next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, neither their family member nor distant relative has ever
appeared to claim the said fund.Upon this discovery, I and other officials
in my department have agreed to make business with you and release the total
amount into your account as the heir of the fund since no one came for it or
discovered the maintained account with our bank, otherwise the fund will be
returned to the banks treasury as unclaimed fund.</P>
<P>We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus; 30 % for
you as foreign partner,60 % for us the officials in my department and 10 %
for the settlement of all local and foreign expenses incurred by us and you
during the course of this business.Upon the successful completion of this
transfer, I and one of my colleagues will come to your country and mind our
share. It is from our 60 % we intend to import Agricultural Machineries into
my country as a way of recycling the fund. To commence this transaction, we
require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return e-mail and
enclose your private contact </P>
<P>enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for
necessary approvals before the transfer can be made. </P>
<P>Note also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL because of
its nature. </P>
<P>I look forward to receiving your prompt response. PLEASE REPLY THROUGH
THIS MY E-MAIL ADDREStelephone number, fax number full name and address and
