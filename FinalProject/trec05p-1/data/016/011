Mr. Hyatt, Greetings from eSource:

Pursuant to your request for 5 years of gas production for the Rocky Mountain Region.   I'm providing the historical data 1999-1996 as reported to the Energy Information Administration.  Arizona's data was shown not available.  However, I have attached Arizonia's gas production and sales data, available through the EIA's special reports. I will provide the forecasted data as soon as it is available.   Should you have any further questions, or additional tasking, please do not hesitate to contact us.


  


Thank you for using eSource.  We look forward to assisting you in the future.
Cynthia Boseman-Harris
