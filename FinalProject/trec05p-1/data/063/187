Just an FYI...

When I fax you a CAF (Contract Approval Form) you are approving that specific deal to be tendered to the Shipper.  You only need to FAX back the actually CAF signature page unless you have changes/corrections; not the ENTIRE agreement.  My FAX number is 713-646-8085.  If you send it somewhere else, I probably won't get it.  Thanks for the prompt reviews.  It's going to take a while but the process is getting faster and we're definitely following the ETS Contracts Policy MUCH better.
