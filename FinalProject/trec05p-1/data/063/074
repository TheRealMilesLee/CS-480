Subject:	Show Cause order info

Please provide comments on the draft show cause order by COB Monday 9/10.  There may be a revised version out later today with Steve W. and some other comments incorporated after yesterday's phone call.  Final draft should be ready Tues. or Wed. and we will have a conference call late Wed afternoon to finalize.  It can then be shopped at FERC (Linda/Sarah -- can you gather a list of who to contact at FERC?)  Also, Steve and Rick will take it to the Commissioner meetings on 9/17.  

We want to have some press coverage when we file (Janel to handle?)
Paul is going to clear this with PGE deal folks
Paul needs to give a heads up to Western govs when we file
We can provide it the day before or day of filing to some groups:  Ideas
-EPSA
-ELCON, Steel group, etal. (filed this week to support FERC mandating a single Midwest RTO)
-Nat'l Rural Elec. Coop (Glenn English recently gave a speech requesting a fully integrated grid)
-These groups filed to make Alliance get an independent board (Janine-would they be helpful?):  Coalition of Midwest Transmission Customers, Industrial Energy Users-Ohio; WVa Energy Users Group; Assoc. of Businesses Advocating Tariff Equity; Citizens Action Coalition of Ind; Izaak Walton League of North America; Environmental Law and Policy Center
-Some coops and munis represented by Speigal and McDiarmid in DC and Miller Balis & ONeill in DC (EPMI signed on to their filing against the NC PUC's request for stay of the SE RTO mediation)

Contains Steve's comments                        << File: EnronReq-Notes(SLW).DOC >>          plus, we are changing the MBRs test to state that OATT is not enough to mitigate transmission market power -- need to agree to join RTO as finally ordered per 7/12 orders.  Thanks
