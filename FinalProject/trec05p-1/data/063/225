There was a conflict with the 1pm time. The latest, greatest suggestion is 11 PM pst. Once again, let me know if this doesn't work.

Elliot wants to have another conference call to discuss this weeks events. It seems that we've made some progress on several projects in the last few days. A suggestion was made that we schedule something around 1 PM pst tomorrow. That's 3pm on a Friday for you Houstonians…  Let me know if this doesn't work for anyone. Assuming there are no conflicts, I'll send a call-in number either this afternoon or early tomorrow.
Cheers,
Jesse
