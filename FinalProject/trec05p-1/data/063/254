Thanks for that, I have a couple of other time periods for this same customer.  They are naturally long and I think I could work something out if you guys are natural buyers.  The other 2 periods are: Jun-Dec02 (starting one month later than your last quote)
The other period is the PJM planning year Jun02-May03.  The amount could be higher if that works for you guys.  Let me know if you want to do more than 100 MW and I will see what I can do.  Nick

Nick,

We already provided a bid ror Cal02 PJM UCAP.  Do you have another prospect for May-Dec02?  If so, what is the additonal quantity that you are talking about?

Nick,

I spoke to Narshima about this deal.  EESI would be bid at $46.00/MWD for Unforced Capacity Credits for Cal02.  Are you asking if we would have a bid for the energy as well?  If so, I would need to know the specific location for this generator (i.e. what point does this energy enter the PJM system).

Regards,

Richard

Richard,

Did Narsimha have a bid for 20 MW of Unforced Capacity Credits in PJM for Cal02?  My customer would like to sell this as well as energy.  I need to show him a price this morning.  Nick
