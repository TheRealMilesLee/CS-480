Gayle,

I'm free that afternoon and can ride with you if you have room. 
If you need a second car to drive I can give some others a ride.

Please send a reminder and details on when/where to meet.

Thanks,

Carmen

P.S. Our setback hearing went smoothly the P&D Dept. was
        very supportive and commented that our application was 
        one of the best they'd seen. Marlene Gafrick was especially 
        helpful for P&D.

Be sure to read the "Neartown Notebook" article on page 10 of This Week
section of today's Chronicle.

This is very important for all of us who would like to preserve both the
value and the ambiance of our blocks.  It tells about a proposal by
Neartown to enable property owners on a block-by-block basis to apply
for adherence to existing lot sizes (50 x 100 in most cases).

As it is, when a developer buys a lot in the middle of a block, he can
cut up the lot into as many as three small lots (as many as four on
corners) and build out to the property line in some cases.  This, of
course, makes it hard to sell the other houses on that block for
anything but teardowns--very bad news if you plan to make improvements
to your home or even keep it up.

There is a very important public hearing at 2:30 p.m. on October 18 at
City Hall Annex (across the street west from City Hall).  Call me if you
want a ride to the meeting or if you will take other people;  I plan to
coordinate rides to the hearing.
