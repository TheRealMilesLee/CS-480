Earl,  Here is a partial list of what I don't see on Agave's list:

PIPING
2" pipe for blowdown
Overpressure switch on Bettis Actuator
Leveling saddles
Insulating kits to isolate meter run - (there is one kit - probably to
isolate piping from TW)
Orifice meter safety sleeve - KLAK Engineering


INSTRUMENTATION
Pressure transmitters
Temperature transmitter & thermosync RTDS
Valve manifolds & Coplanar
Genie probe regulator
Genie probe (w/o regulator)
Gas detection system, alarm & strobe light
Solenoid box for shut-in upon gas detection
Printer
Timer & relay box for H2S shut-in
Calibration gas
Carrier gas
Carrier gas regulators
Surge arrestors
Stainless Steel hoses for carrier gas & calibration gas
1/4" Heat trace tubing, thermostat & end connections
Battery charge/UPS
Cables, tubing, conduit, wire, swagelok fittings, needles valves, j-boxes,
hoffman box
Grounding Anodes and cables
Desk, chair, cabinet, paper, trash can

Some of this equipment is probably included with the Delmars or the
Danalyzer, but that information is unknown from this list.  In addition,
some of this equipment like conduit & wire, tubing & fittings, can be
supplied by the contractor that builds the interconnect.
