Dear Everyone,

I will be performing at Strings in the East Bay on Wednesday, October 10th.
It’s a homey room and extremely artist-friendly, so far off the corporate
path that the owner doesn’t advertise or even publish the address on the
web.  Of course, it’s not so homey that you can’t get a drink, and it’s
close enough to the pulse that artists like Shawn Mullins still appear there
regularly.  For those of you wary of crossing the Bay Bridge, it really isn’
t all that far (20-30 minutes), and this may be your last chance to catch my
act this year.  Here are the details:

Bob Hillman
