Mr. Peter Chang
Hang Seng Bank Ltd
Sai Wan Ho Branch           
Hong Kong.
peterchang64@netscape.net

Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Peter Chang director of perations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branch.I have a obscured business suggestion for you.

A Russian business man by name Michel Kivnosky made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Eleven millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him,up till early last year, several notifications was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Mr. Kivnosky and his family had died in a terrible accident while on vacation in the himalayas.

After further investigation it was also discovered that Mr. Michel Kivnosky did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Eleven millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.

Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Michel Kivnosky so that you will be able to receive his funds.

WHAT IS TO BE DONE.

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Mr. Michel Kivnosky, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of 
probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.

There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for you .

Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefers you to reach me on the email address below (peterchang64@netscape.net) and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation.

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Respectfully Submitted

Mr. Peter Chang
