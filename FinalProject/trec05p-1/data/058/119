Mark Taylor and Brad Richter discussed this Friday and Brad and I will stay on top of it with Mark and Richard Sanders.  Pickering checked with Webb and he felt it was probably without merit.

Just spoke to Mark Taylor.  He is having a copy of the lawsuit sent down to you.  Richard Sanders, our litigator will handle this case.  Mark's and Richard's initial opinion based on a quick review is that it's not a big deal.
