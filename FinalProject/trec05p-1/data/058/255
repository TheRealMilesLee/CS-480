It's not over till it's over. 



Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; Teach him to use the Net and he won't bother you for weeks. . There is no fool like an old fool. . Always in a hurry, always behind. . Forewarned is forearmed. .
Drink like a fish, water only. 

He who laughs last, laughs longest. 

no more?

Like a fish out of water. . Love to live and live to love. . Patience is a virtue. .
One of these days is none of these days. . As fit as a fiddle. . A fool uttereth all his mind. .

Do as I say not as I do. . Few words and many deeds. . Hasty judgements are generally faulty. .
