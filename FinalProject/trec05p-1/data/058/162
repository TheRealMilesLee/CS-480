Hi Louise,
Currently we have 2001 forecast and 2002 plan as the information to be provided to you on the templates. Would you like for us to add in 2001 plan, as we did for the back-office presentations? 

Also, have you had an opportunity to create the goals & objectives portion of their presentation? 

FYI- each team has completed their expense portion of the plan presentation.  I'll send up a book Monday- the teams are still working on the 2001 margin forecast, so I'll send that update as soon as it's available.
