Mikhail Khodorkovskythe richest man in Russia and
owner of the following companies:Chairman CEO: YUKOS
OIL (Russian Most Largest Oil Company) Chairman
CEO:Menatep SBP Bank (A well reputable financial
institution with its branchesall over the world)

SOURCE OF FUNDS:
The documents of the above funds in question was
handed over to me tobe used in payment of an American
oil merchant for his last oil dealwith my boss Mikhail
Khodorkovsky. Already the funds have been
depositedwith TRESURY SERVICES EUROPE ,where
the final crediting is expected to be carried out.
While I was on the process, My Boss got arrested
forhis involvement on politics in financing the 
leading and opposing political parties (the Union of
Right Forces, led by Boris Nemtsov, and Yabloko, a
liberal/social democratic party led by Gregor
Yavlinsky) which poses treat toPresident Vladimir

YOUR ROLE:
All I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of
the above quoted sum and I will arrange for the
documentation which will enable TRESURY SERVICES EUROPE
 transfer the sum to you. I
have decided to use this sum to relocate to American
continent and never to be connected to any of Mikhail
Khodorkovsky conglomerates. The transaction has to
be concluded in 2 weeks before Mikhail Khodorkovsky 
is out on bail.
As soon as I get your willingness to comply through
