Grow angry slowly, there's plenty of time. . Listen to the pot calling the kettle black. . Drop a penny leave it lay.
A poor man is better than a liar. . If the cap fits, wear it. . As is the gardener so is the garden. .

The golden age never was the present one. . Absence makes the heart grow fonder. . Keep your mouth shut and your eyes open. .
