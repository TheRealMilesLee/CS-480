> Christmas is a time to be jolly,
> To decorate with lights and holly.

> Santa Claus he brings the toys,
> But only for good girls and boys. 
> 
> But Christmas is more than just a season.  
> Why we celebrate, there is a reason.
> 
> It's Jesus birthday, that's why we rejoice,
> And everyone should hear our voice.
> 
> So as we hang our Christmas decorations,
> And celebrate with all the nations,
> 
> Remember what Christmas is all about ...
> Not Santa Claus, Elves, or Rudolph there's no doubt. 
> 
> But the day Jesus Christ, our Savior is born,
> The Man who wore that crown of thorns.
> 
> Who died on a cross so that we may live,
> That is why we should happily give.
> 
> So it's not Merry Christmas, but Happy Birthday!
> Those are the words we should say today.
