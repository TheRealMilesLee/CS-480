I forwarded this to Danny and left two phone messages but I have never heard back as to what he wanted done about this software.   cvb

Please  let me know if you like to see any  details about this application.

Caroline Barnes has asked if you would scan the ETS systems to identify who has the PROPHETX software installed.  We're concerned about the name...it could be PROFITX.  However, Danny McCarty has it installed, so you could check the spelling there.

Would you please provide her with a report?  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 33270 or Caroline at 36375.

Thanks,
Chris
