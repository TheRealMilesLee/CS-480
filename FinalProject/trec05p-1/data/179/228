Attached is an e:mail that I forwarded to Jeff Speirs, a bankruptcy attorney with Andrews and Kurth who will be assisting with the mechanics of rejecting the out of the money transportation agreements that you all have identified.  I imagine that we will need full company names, contact persons and addresses in order to place the different pipes on notice of the motion to reject.  Could you please coordinate the gathering of this information so that we will be in a position to act on it as soon as possible after New Years?  Thanks for your help.

Jeff,

I am an Enron Wholesale Services attorney who is advising on ENA gas transportation matters.  Elizabeth Sager suggested that I contact you about assisting me with the preparation of a Motion to Reject the bulk of the executory transportation service agreements that ENA has with interstate pipeline companies.  

The attached spreadsheet summarizes the terms of said transportation agreements; please note that the first sheet of the spreadsheet file describes the 5 transportation contracts that ENA wishes to assume; the remainer are out of the money transportation and storage arrangements that ENA desires to reject.  Please review the attached and let me know if it contains sufficient information with which to proceed with the preparation of the Motion.  

I imagine you will have plenty of questions. . . . I myself have a number of questions regarding the agency relationships shown on the spreadsheet, as well as ENA's right or need to reject those Service Agreements under which ENA has heretofore released pipeline capacity to third parties.  

I look forward to speaking with you about these matters as well as determing the timeframe for rejecting these contracts.
