Greetings amigos,

Just wanted to inform you to check out this great site that is giving
away iPods for free!

I've joined and I think you should as well. 

This company, Gratis Network, has already distributed $4 million in free items,
including 11,000 iPods!

Click link below, sign up, tell some friends and you've got yourself an iPod.

Here is the simplified link.  Enjoy!
