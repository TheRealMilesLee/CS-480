Lisa:

ENA has received a second written request from a financial counterparty (Union Spring Fund Ltd.) for the return of $150,000 cash collateral plus interest.  The cash was posted as initial margin on trade date of the swaps.  We have confirmed that all trades were terminated as of mid-December, 2001.  The counterparty has not sent a "termination letter" as there was nothing to terminate, but has sent a letter requesting return of the collateral.

Although we may not want to return the cash, aren't we obligated to do so?
