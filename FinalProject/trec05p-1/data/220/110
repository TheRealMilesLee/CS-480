The ECC estate has this morning proposed a frankly over-the-top list of human resource, systems, software and services requirements from UBSW Canada after closing.  Milnthorp and I have just had it out with Kyle Kitagawa and his counsel.  We will let you know.

Other items that need to be resolved for closing:

1.  Need to finalize Canadian Master Agreement - comments provided Saturday

2.  Need to finalize Canadian Transitional Services - see above

3.  Need to finalize Canadian office lease arrangements with landlords

4.  Need to finalize the list of FF&E to be kept by the estate

5.  Need to finalize the UBS AG counterparty/guarantee issue
