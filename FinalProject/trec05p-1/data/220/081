I'm afraid we are leaning toward the 16th now.  I hope you can still make it.

All,

Sarah and I would like to host a dinner for the gang.

Please check your calendars to see if either of these two dates work.

March 9th or March 16th.

Let me know if one, either or neither date is available.

Mark
