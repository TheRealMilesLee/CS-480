Risk and Reward

Attend the Power Marketing Association's Seventh Annual Spring Conference: Power Markets 2002: Risk and Reward, April 17-18, 2002, at the Excalibur Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.

We will see record numbers of new powerplants coming on line this year. New, much larger RTOs promise dramatic increases in liquidity. The Enron fallout will continue to force balance sheet improvements-- perhaps more mergers and acquisitions. Price volatility will continue, and risk management techniques will continue to be honed. 

Come hear the experts who will help you survive and thrive in 2002! 

Topics 

Transmission and RTOs: Representatives from PJM, Cal ISO and Midwest ISO on their respective regions.

Credit: Susan Abbott of Moody's on evolving credit standards in our industry

Insurance: Scott Ettien from NCM, Lynda Clemmons from Element Re and Pat Toner Goudarzi from ACE, on Credit Insurance, Weather-risk Insurance and Innovative Insurance Products, respectively

Exchanges: Monte SImpson of InterContinental Exchange and Brad Leach of NYMEX on the growth in the use of exchanges.

Markets: Chris Pollatos of Mirant, Dave Freeman of Panda and Mike Young of Aquila on the state of various aspects of the power markets.

And More! Cabell Poindexter of Wyndham Mills on job prospects! John OBrien of Skipping Stone on the outlook for Transmission! Henwood on outlook for powerplant construction! Adrian Palmer of Caminus Corp on European Markets! 

Fundamentals of Power Marketing. On April 16, Scott Spiewak will be repeating his "Fundamentals of Power Marketing" preconference seminar. Essential for the new industry participant, it is also a valuable overview for the industry professional.
