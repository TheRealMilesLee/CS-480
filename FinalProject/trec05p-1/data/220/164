OPEN SEASON

 

SG Resources Mississippi, L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of SGR 

Holdings, L.L.C., is conducting an open season for firm storage 

services at its new high-deliverability, salt cavern, natural gas 

storage facility, known as the Southern Pines Energy Center. The open 

season will begin at 9:00 a.m. CDT on February 4, 2002, and will 

continue until 5:00 p.m. CDT on March 4, 2002. The project is located 

at the border of Mississippi and Alabama with access to the major 

pipelines serving the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeastern United 

States. The facility is ideally located to serve as a transportation 

and storage hub for shippers on any one of nine major pipelines that 

will be interconnected directly or indirectly to the project.

web site at
