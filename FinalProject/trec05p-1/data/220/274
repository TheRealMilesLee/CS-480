Gene Laurenson from Beatrice is scheduling Wednesday February the 6th to do measurement testing at the NGPL Trailblazer interconnect. They are bringing Don Mowrer (NNG specialist) and a specialist in from NGPL to perform the tests. They would like to see the flows stay about were they are at. (425 +) Also, he said it would be a bonus if some of the gas was being compressed up the C-line. (Currently compressing up the C & D and cracking into the B)
