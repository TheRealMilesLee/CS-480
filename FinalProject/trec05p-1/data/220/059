It was another epic adventure in Lake Tahoe as we "had it goin on"!  The skiing was great,  the scenery fine and the laughs gut wrenching.  Don and I almost fell off the lift at Squaw Valley from Andy's cutting edge humor.  

Here are the top ten lines from Ski Trip 2002. 

10.  Ichiban...or is it Ichi-Bob? 
9.   Hey Turch, put the yellow side up. 
8.   They must only let you guys out once a year. 
7.   My puppies are burnin! 
6.   Oh Billie, Billie, Billie. 
5.   One time? Come on...one time! 
4.   Hey Andy, what's that dirty t-shirt doing on the floor? 
3.   Alright Tommy, we'll take you to McDonalds. 
2.   Come right now, right now.  I make big big big offa. 
1.   Yan Can Cook! 

Ski Trip 2003 is tentatively scheduled for Jan. 29th - Feb. 2nd, 2003.  The venue will be Park City, Utah.  More details coming this fall.  Give me a call for more information and mark your calendars now!
