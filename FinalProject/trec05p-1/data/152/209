I just asked Phil -

He said that Mexican has not found the supply yet.  He told me that they are having problems finding the suppy, but he did not give me details.  Both Stephanie and Phil are talking with Mexican and they know the specifics from Mexican.

I have stranded all the transport to the border out of Keystone for the month of December.

The transport volumes that have been taken out are as follows:

	22,836 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg

	11,418 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg (this is the mexican de cobra deal).  Previously Mexican de Cobra was buying the gas from Texaco.  Starting in 					December, Mexican will have to find another supply for this gas.  They will no longer buy from Texaco.  Phil Polsky is talking with 					Mexican, and a deal will be entered into Sitara, once Mexican has found a supply.  So as of now, the 11,828 supply coming into Keystone 				for this deal is not in the system.

	3975 - Keystone  -->  Socal Topock
