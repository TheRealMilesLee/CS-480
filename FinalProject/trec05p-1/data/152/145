Gerald, I attach a copy of the current form of master physical gas agreement ECC has in place with CNR.  Randy will send you a credit worksheet in the next half hour.  Can you make sure that your form of master has the triangular setoff language that Mark Haedicke distributed a month or so ago to be included in all agreements, as CNR wants to ensure there is cross-affiliate setoff.  Once it is prepared, Howard Sangwine, the commercial contact in Calgary, will walk the document over to CNR, so you can send it to me and I will get it to him.

Thanks for your help.

Greg
