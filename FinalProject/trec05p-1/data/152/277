I have organized representatives from operations, tax, regulatory, financial, accounting, legal, tax, insurance and H/R, who are all on standby for discussion.  We are meeting this afternoon to assess the ETA for each of the items listed and the optimal delivery method (bulletin board, electronic, etc.).  I will email to you this list sometime early tomorrow.  My comment on materiality goes to such items as ALL contracts (big or small), ALL minutes from BOD meetings from inception, ALL vehicle information, just to name a few. Rather than materiality, prioritization may be a better word.

Kevin,

Rather than set a materiality scope at this point, lets focus on certain
sections for our meeting on Thursday.   I hope that this will reduce the
burden of gathering data and people for the meeting.

I think we should use our time on Thursday to cover:
   Operations
   Financial
   Accounting
   Regulatory
   Environmental

Please let me know if this works for you.

Attached is a red line version of the previous due diligence list sent with
a few updates.

If you have any questions, please give me a call (713/767-4764).

Kyle
