Let me introduce myself as the new dean of Texas A&M's Lowry Mays 
College & Graduate School of Business. As dean of the Mays College 
and a member of the class of '83, I am honored to be associated with 
our school and look forward to working with you to further its 
development.

One of my first and foremost initiatives is engaging our stakeholders 
in an intensive branding and imaging campaign to appropriately 
communicate what it means to be a graduate of the Mays College and of 
Texas A&M University. To do so, I have asked a well-known marketing 
and branding consultant and former student, Mr. Brandon Coleman '78, 
to assist me in this effort.

Thus far, we have met with current students, faculty, staff, 
corporate recruiters, and our college's advisory boards to get their 
thoughts. Now, it is time to reach out to you as a graduate of this 
college and ask for your valuable opinions.

You have undoubtedly reflected upon your Texas A&M University 
experience and have personally seen the value of your business 
degree. Please share your reflections with us.
  - What does being a business graduate from Texas A&M mean to you?
  - What should it mean?
  - How are we at the Mays College different?
  - How has your business degree helped you in your life?

While these may seem to be simple questions, your answers will help 
us communicate more effectively to others the uniqueness of the 
educational experience of the Mays College at Texas A&M.

To respond to these questions, visit 
http://maysbusiness.tamu.edu/se/input.htm . Your answers are 
anonymous unless you choose to give us your name and contact 
information, but doing so isn't required.  You have through December 
3 to give us your input  through this Web page.

I thank you in advance for taking the time to give me your feedback, 
and ask your understanding of the somewhat impersonal nature of an 
e-mail approach.

Please accept my most sincere wishes for every future success. If we 
at the Mays College can ever be of assistance to you, do not hesitate 
to contact us at maysbusiness@tamu.edu.

Regards, Jerry

Jerry R. Strawser '83, Dean
Mays College & Graduate School of Business
Texas A&M University
