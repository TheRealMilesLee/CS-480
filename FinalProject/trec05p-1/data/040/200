Louise,

I understand that you will shortly receive a first draft budget submission for ENA. I'm not sure what format you'll receive it in, but if its the standard format, it'll be difficult to pick out the project level estimates.

I have access to the team/project level estimates, and would be happy to pull together a quick view that suits you.

I was going to try to guess how you would like to see it, but I thought I'd better ask you first, ....it'll probably save me a lot of work! :) The thought was to give you a quick handle on whats "essential-keep the business running" stuff, and what would be great but we can struggle on without.

Please remember this is supposed to be a quick heads-up, and not intended to replace any full explanation that will innevitably follow later.

Some alternatives (obviously, feel free to suggest your own)

1.
Capital
	Team
		Project 1 Name		Description	ENA $		
		Project 2 Name		Description	ENA $
Expense
		Project 1 Name		Description	ENA $		
		Project 2 Name		Description	ENA $

2.
Capital
	Team								% Essential	% Nice to Have
		Project 1 Name		Description	ENA $			40%		60%
		Project 2 Name		Description	ENA $			80%		20%
Expense
		Project 1 Name		Description	ENA $		
		Project 2 Name		Description	ENA $

Please let me know what you would prefer, and I'll try to get you the view by the end of the day.

regards

Steve
