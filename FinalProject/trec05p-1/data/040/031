BT;
- I feel like foghorn leghorn on this project (ie: "I'm pitching but not one's catching")...I have been trying to find ABC/ANG capacity (per your inquiry for 10,000 capacity for winter only) in addition to looking for 5,000 of ABC only capacity for Petrobank (they actually have firm ANG/PGT but let their ABC go) 
- fyi, (this has not been press released) but it looks like NOVA/ANG will have an additional 60,000 of contracted capacity avail this Nov 1 (part of the expansion that was to go with the PGT expansion but is being done early as it only goes as far as kinsgate)...no surprise that the shipper to get the capacity is BC Gas (to use for Southern Crossing) 
- I'm afraid that the best we can offer is IT Tolls (.17 C/GJ for Nova + .08 C/GJ for ANG + .06 for Fuel on ANG) = .31 C/GJ
- as far as ABC capacity, there are mismatches (that are complicated by higher fuel rates in the winter) but I will keep working the phones
- do you know if any of the PNW/Calif shippers-utilities have excess ABC capacity and an interest in ANG/PGT??? (Petrobank will likely look at any term winter/1 yr/longer)
- based on previous dealings, Petrobank is motivated 
   

Thanks,

GH
