Larry,

Please give me a report following your fly-over of the route with Doug Cebryk.  I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are there.  Don't forget to take your camera.  Pictures (slides) would be most helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield portion.  As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will need to develop some preliminary maps.  It is my understanding that no maps of the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, Taylor, Veatch and Shafer.

After we receive the "fatal-flaw" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - although I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should be scheduled to expedite the project as follows:
1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the project potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, etc).  These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw analysis.
2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season reflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental Strategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out soliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits). 
3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with the FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, US Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources early in the process.
4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with local, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so the right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news media.  This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the project will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or Houston, etc.).  A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix area and for the Southwest.

I know there is more, but this will help to keep some of the early events coordinated.  John Shafer
