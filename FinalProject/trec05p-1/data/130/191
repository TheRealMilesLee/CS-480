Jim, Chandra, Jon, and Bob:

Tektronix is looking to interview some of our "top" finance students.
Please read the note below and see if you have a senior or MBA student
that you think should forward their resume to Tektronix. David will be
here on campus next Wednesday and if we can have a couple students send
their resume up electronic by Monday he said he can look them over and
get back to the students. I will be out tomorrow morning so if you have
a great student have them send their resume. Otherwise send me the name
and I can try and contact the student. Ray

Raymond:  Thanks again for helping us out.  If you are able to find some
seniors who are interested, we are planning to on-campus in Bexel 202
interviewing some accounting students on Wednesday of next week.  If you
had some resumes, they could be forwarded to my admin, Lisa Logsdon
(lisa.logsdon@tek.com).  It would be best for us if we could receive
resumes by Monday, then we would plan to turn those around quickly and
get word back to those students who we would like to meet with on
Wednesday.

Thanks again for helping us out with our recruiting efforts.  Going
directly through the faculty members who know the students has proven in
the past to be the most efficient and effective manner for us to move
forward.  It
really helps us out.   I can be reached at 503.627.4608 for any
questions or
clarification.  

Thanks again
