Staci,

Do you want Bill Rapp to approve Agave's portion of the Grynberg invoices since he has taken over Susan's position?  If so, please explain to him what these invoices are all about because I can't do it justice!  Thanks!

P.S.  He has 3 of these invoices in iPayit that he needs to approve . . . so the sooner the better.  Thanks!  :-)
