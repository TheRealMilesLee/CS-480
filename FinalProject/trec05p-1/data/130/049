I am about to leave to go to the store.  Mimi is at our house. I can't get a
hold of anyone about counseling.  I have left several messages.  My day
started out ok, but I feel like I am about to loose it again.  Please call
me on my cell phone if you have time to talk.  I guess I just need some
reassurance that we will be able to fix this if we work very hard.  I just
want you to believe that.
