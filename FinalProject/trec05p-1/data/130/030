Attached is the most recent draft of the Aruba Review Process Outline.  As of today, we have started briefing the commercial terms of the agreement, are aggregating all of the deal tickets and comparing with the supply contracts/transportation agreements, started to compare actual historical usage vs. forecasted load data, and have a meeting scheduled with Settlements on Monday.  I will be out of the office for the rest of today and all of tomorrow, but will check voicemail.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kelli
