The Agave party may be one we have to skip this year. With all of the financial issues Enron is dealing with this would not be considered commercially necessary. We need to take a look at all of our expenses and only do what is absolutely necessary. I have asked Audrey to hold off on ordering any more customer gifts other than what has already been financially comitted to thus far.

FYI....

I believe Dave N. and Sue had a conversation regarding help in the risk mgmt area.  I saw Dave in the hallway earlier and he indicated that he wanted to rally with you and me to discuss. 
I've got two calls into Tom Armstrong with SW Gas.  I hope to get him to send in a request this week.  Also, James has been running numbers today, so I should have a term sheet for you tomorrow.  
The Agave Christmas Party is on Tuesday, December 11.  Is it possible to take a company plane out with reps from mgmt, mktg, gas logistics and operations?  
We are also running a few more scenarios for TransPecos.

Thanks, Kim.
