Mark:

Mark Haedicke and Lance Schuler asked me and Pete del Vecchio to draft a letter to Dynegy to clarify certain of the covenants and to ask for their consent to certain possible transactions.  We would like your input on what we ask for and how we go about asking.

I understand Lance Schuler spoke with you today regarding having a telephone conference tomorrow on this.  Please send me an e-mail or leave me a voice mail (713 345-1549) as to what time is convenient for you.

I'm also sending this to you by fax.
