FYI
 
***NEW and IMPROVED SITE - National Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy (DSIRE)
 
The National Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy (DSIRE), has updated and moved its Web site to www.dsireusa.org. The database, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) and managed by North Carolina Solar Center, is a clearinghouse of all existing programs to help encourage private efforts to convert to renewable energy sources (solar, water, and wind power). This new, user-friendly database is a must-see for anyone interested in tracking state and local renewable energy initiatives. The chart-driven site provides a variety of useful tools, including current and accurate information on incentives, programs, and policies, as well as access to documentation and legislation of state and local governments.
 
DSIRE's new Web site has been redesigned to include full text searching, incentive summary maps, new/updated incentives links, incentive descriptions, state-by-state reports, and related links. Various incentives include grants, rebates, loans, personal tax incentives, corporate tax incentives, sales tax incentives, property tax incentives, industry recruitment, and leasing and sales programs for utilities companies. Recently, schools have been utilizing solar power through these programs, with Texas hosting a number of projects. This new, user-friendly database is a must-see for anyone interested in tracking state and local renewable energy initiatives.
 
For more information about what DSIRE has to offer, see its Web site at: www.dsireusa.org
