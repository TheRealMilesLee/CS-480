 	 Someone will win $1 Million!!

Someone is guaranteed to win $1 Million in the Office Pool Challenge. If you REALLY know football, it could be you! There are 7 weeks left in the season - and 7 opportunities to win!
It's easy to play. Just predict which teams will cover the point spread each week.

If someone picks every game right in a week, that person is entered into a random drawing with everyone else who made "perfect picks" during the season. If no one makes "perfect picks" then the 17 weekly high-scorers are entered into a drawing for the $1 Million prize.

Someone is guaranteed to win $1 Million...why can't it be you? Other prizes are up for grabs too - so SIGN UP TODAY! <http://poolchallenge.fantasy.sportsline.com/?r=esfb1114_html>
