Dear Harry,

I recently sent an announcement regarding our zPro Special Offer ( code TL1ED ).  Because so many people are making special efforts to be with family this Thanksgiving in particular, we're extending the time period for the special zPro offer until November 28.

In case you haven't already signed up, I encourage you to check out zPro's features at

	http://newslink.zoomerang.com/ss?click&zoom-clicks&3be9cec4

Call 877-771-7758 by November 28 and mention promo code TL1ED or email us at mailto:customerservice@zoomerang.com?subject=TL1ED to take advantage of the extended time period for this special zPro offer.

More than 25% of Fortune 500 companies use zPro for sending surveys and collecting results, because of features like

   - Personalizing and branding your surveys by uploading images
   - Downloading results into spreadsheet format
   - Cross tabulating and comparing responses from one question to another
   - Creating longer surveys
   - Unlimited data storage

You now have until November 28 to call 877-771-7758 or email us at mailto:customerservice@zoomerang.com?subject=TL1ED to take advantage of this special offer.

Sincerely,

Dana Meade, Director of Product Management
