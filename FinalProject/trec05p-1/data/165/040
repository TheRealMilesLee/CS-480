FROM THE DESK OF MR ISSA AHMED
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ANNEX)
BILL AND EXCHANGE DEPARTMENT,
OFFSHORE OFFICE,OUAGADOUGOU,BURKINA-FASO.

       Dear.
I know that this letter may come to you as a suprise.I got your contact 
address from the Internet while I was searching for a busines partner.
My name is MR ISSA AHMED.the Bill and Exchange(assistant) Manager of 
the 
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ANNEX) ,Ouagadouguo Burkina Faso.
In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of USD$22.300.000 
(TWENTY 
TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED U.S.A DOLLARS). In an account that belongs to 
this 
our foreign customer who died along with his wife and and children in 
the 
plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been 
expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we 
cannot 
release it unless somebody applies for it as the next of kin or 
relation to 
the deceased, as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately 
we 
learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside 
with him 
in the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.
It is therefore upon this discovery that I and my colleague in the 
department now decided to make this business proposals to you and 
release 
the money to you as next of
kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement 
since 
nobody is coming for it because we don't want this money to go into the 
bank 
treasury as unclaimed Bill. The banking law and guidelines here 
stipulates 
that if such money remains unclaimed after  five years, the money will 
be 
transferred into the bank treasury as
unclaimed fund.
The request of foreigner in this transaction is necessary because our 
late 
customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to 
a 
foreigner. We agree that
33% of this money will be for you as foreigner partner in respect to 
the 
provision of a foreign account.2% will be set aside for expenses 
incurred 
during the business and 65%
would be for me and my colleague, after which we shall  visit your 
country 
for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.
To enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as we arranged,you 
will 
furnished me with a good receving account detail where the money will 
be 
transfered into,your private tel and fax number for easy communication.
Upon receipt of the above mentioned, I will send to you by fax or 
e-mail a 
text of the application which you shall retype and fax to our foreign 
remittance Department,for
easy execution of the transaction.
I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% 
hitch-free on both side. As all required arrangement have been made for 
this 
transaction.
Please I would like  you to keep this transaction confidential and as a 
top 
secret as you may wish to know that we are Bank officials.
Your promt response will be highly appreciated.
Yours Sincerely,
ISSA AHMED(MR)
