Greetings all,

My @home e-mail is defunct and I am not up on the new one yet. Fortunately, I 
kept my AOL account but I am back in the Dark Ages on a phone line with no 
DSL availability (slow, slow slow) and it ties up the phone.

Anyway,  Charry, could you send the list for Wil and Haley to me at 
dasovichd@aol.com.

Jeff asked me to send a list for my kids:

Katie:

1)  would like a trip downtown with Aunt Nancy and Haley at Christmas time to 
go window shopping
2) 1/2 hour massage 
3)music CD with Andean music

she's also asked for cool hair accessories and stationery but I think Mike's 
family is getting these

Michael:
1) fleece vest
2) anything about baseball or football (books,games)
3)sleeveless shirts (might be tough to find this time of year)
4) time with any of you on an outing

BIG SECRET: Santa is bringing both kids a Gameboy so a game would be good. 
Robert already got Katie a Harry Potter game. 

Target has Sponge Bob Square Pants and Rocket Power which I think Michael 
would like.

ALSO, everyone is invited to Christmas at our house, like last year, if you 
haven't been formally notified already.

Debbie
