Below is 670939 confirm.  The 3 deals were executed under the WSPP.  Shari Stack approved this special confirm.  Even though the commodity is Schedule A (non-firm), the deal is for firm power.  The other 2 executed confirms have not been scanned into Livelink but it does show that they are executed.  Let me know if you need more information.
