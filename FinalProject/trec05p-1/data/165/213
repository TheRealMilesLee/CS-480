Elizabeth,

Will it be possible for us to negotiate a single number across multiple commodities, or will we need to agree a separate number for each?

e.g. financial gas and financial power - are they one and the same?
How about ENA gas and EPMI power - do we need to agree specific numbers for each, or can we simply allocate internally an aggregate, agreed total?

Dave

Debbie: Our settlements folks are working through the numbers with PSEG as we speak. We may wish to proceed with negotiated settlement based on the MTM numbers contained herein (this is from the spreadsheet you originally sent me), plus the agreed settlement numbers. Please let me know if you are OK for us to proceed using these numbers.

Don: Please let me know if you have someone else who can take over this negotiation. I can complete if you like, but can't spend a lot of time on this given my new responsibilities to the EnronOnline team. I have a 1:30 phone call with PSEG tomorrow (Thursday) to negotiate this number.

Dave
