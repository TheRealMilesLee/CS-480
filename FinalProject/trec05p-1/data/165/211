Heather, 
        
We will need to obtain NSTAR's written approval to disclose their contract to any third party. To date we have received the approval of CMP and UI to disclose to third parties and the CA agreed to is in the form attached.

        
John Llodra is currently working with NSTAR to get them to buy themselves out of our contract. By copy of this email, John, please could you  get NSTAR's  consent to disclose to third parties for the purpose of assigning our obligations to such third parties.

        
Marcus
