You know, this neighborhood bulletin board is really a good thing!

And last night while I was at the Christmas party at the HPD Neartown
storefront, someone told me of having just seen four or five cop cars down at
the Blockbuster at Montrose surrounding a white car with several black men.
I wondered if it could be the folks who've been running our little crime
wave.  Incidently, while at the party, I heard of two stories where folks
with automatic garage doors here in Montrose but outside of EM had gone into
their garages and wound locked up with a pair of gun-toting robbers who took
their wallets and purses.  Sadly, in one, the guy was killed (this one was in
the past 2 or so months).  So there is bad stuff going around.
