Hello Suzanne:

I'm sure you have a million things to do. Cookies to bake, parties to go to, decorating to do, gifts to buy . . . but there's someone very important you shouldn't forget this holiday season -- YOU!

Be nice to yourself for a change! Skip this weekend's chores, forget the mall, pack your bags, and get away this weekend. You could even bring your favorite person along for a surprise holiday. Go this weekend and you'll still have plenty of time and money left for everyone on your holiday shopping list!

Now, time for my holiday gift to you -- $25 off any purchase before January 1! Just type SITE59HOLIDAY in the promotional code field on the billing page. See below for complete details.***
