Dear Beloved in Christ,

It is by the grace of God that I received
Christ,knowing the truth and the truth have set me
free.Having known the truth, I had no choice than to
do what is lawful and right in the sight of God for
eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of
GodÂ´s mercy and glory upon my life.

I am Mrs Maureen Clark from Netherlands.I
am married to Dr.Franklyn Clark who worked with
Chevron/Texaco in Oman for twenty years before he
died in the year 2001.We were married for twenty-seven
years without a child. 

He died during one of the riots in the 
region of Iraq where he went to work outstations.
He was held hostage and slain to death by protesting 
militias of the region. Before his
death we were both born again christians.

My late husband acquired a considerable sum of money
through his  resourcefulness and effectiveness through
the duration of his stay in Oman and his share of the
family 
inheritance,  These monies are currently lodged in a
finance 
institution in Europe. I am desperately in need of your 
assistance and guidance in the dispatch of these monies 
for the sole purpose of ameliorating the suffering of
thousands of 
sick, poor and down trodden individuals ecumenically.

I was recently diagnosed with cancer of the lungs and
the doctors have made it absolutely lucid that this
disease is terminal. The doctors were not exact about
how long I have to live but I am in the know that the
disease has ravaged my body and left me at the mercy
of endless cocktail of drugs been administered to me.
The drugs have gone a long way in alleviating the
pains, but I still feel my life gradually ebbing away.

Presently, I'm with my laptop in a hospital where I have
been undergoing treatment for oesophageal cancer. I have
since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me
that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last wish to
see this money distributed to victims of the Tsunami
disaster in Asia and other charity organizations. Because
relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth
since my illness, I cannot live with the agony of
entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them.
Please,I beg you in the name of God to help me collect the
deposit and the interest accrued from the company and
distribute it accordingly.

I am currently recieving treatments at the Ireland hospital
with the 
address details below.:
  ROYAL VICTORIAL HOSPITAL
  GROSVENOR ROAD
  BELFAST
  BT12  6BA
  ROOM 4779


I do not have any existing family member to my
knowledge to assist me in procuring these monies
before the stipulated time. I established this contact
with you solely out of need and desperation,
communication with you was completely fortuitous and
serendipitous.

I will ask that you inform me of your decision to
assist or decline, please ensure that you make your
decision based on nobility and humanity. Your
assistance will remain forever invaluable and
beneficial to thousands of children across the world.

Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I
stated herein.

I await your urgent reply.

Note;please reply through my private email;maurinclk@web-mail.com.ar

Yours in Christ,

Mrs maureen clark
