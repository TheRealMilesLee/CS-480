Mr. Roger Wick


Midland Power

As we discussed this morning, even though Northern Natural Gas is not a party to the subject ENA/Midland contract, we would be adversely affected should the power service at that location be shut off.  I appreciate your agreeing to notify me (as a courtesy) in advance (402) 398-7061 of any such cessation of service prior to it occurring.

In answer to your specific question, the appropriate party to contact who represents ENA is Mark Knippa, who can be reached at (713) 853-3463.  Only he or whomever he directs you to can speak for ENA.

I understand you just received several documents from ENA and wish to review them before commenting further regarding what Midlands future actions might be.  I also understood you to say that in any event you would not discontinue service over the weekend and not without 24 hours notice so that someone could meet your folks at the site.

Contacts of value to you might be:

ENA Mark Knippa  (713) 853-3463

NNG Tom Gilbert, Regional Director Operations (515) 226-2075
NNG Pierre Marion, Operator at Hubbard Station (319) 269-5003
