Cara,
I pulled several comments you made out, and dittos from here.

I agree with your following statements:

	Even though this path could be consolidated to be smaller, we have many paths that are a good deal longer.  The part of the path in blue is in the 	upstream cell and seems to be the holdup. The size limit of the path needs to be considerably larger, or we need a way to override that for exceptionally 	long paths. I made the path smaller and got the same error.

I notice that when we have values in the transmission cells, the big E is not on there. Enron needs to be shown as "bookends" on the transmission we use, or else it could be misconstrued as a purchase or sale.

Some really long paths might show better in line view if that could auto-size vertically

When I try to cut a particlar path, the action of the entire Path Cut screen coming up and then me having to choose New Path cut totally blocks my view of the existing path I am trying to deal with. I think instead this should pop up as an addition to the expanded view of the existing deal. I should be able to cut a path without having to deal with the whole sort menu.


I absolutely agree with the following:
	Region should be a button list that is driven only by the East or West designation of the person's Enpower Login.  As a West User, I should only get 5 choices for 	Region: WSCC-N, WSCC-S, Rockies, MidC, or California. The drop down list is time consuming,  confusing and can lead to too many errors.

	Reason Text-this is not spelled correctly,  and the text box could be much smaller.  Most Reasons are probably a sentence at most.
