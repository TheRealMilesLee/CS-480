SoCal hopes that AB82xx at least passes the Assembly this week so it gets into Conference Committee prior to the recess.  Even though the current form of the bill is unfavorable, SoCal believes that if they can get the bill into conference committee, then "anything can happen" and more favorable terms could be restored.  At a minimum, the bill buys time.  As such, the Senate vote may not be as critical for SoCal and its creditors as long as the bill passes the Assembly.
