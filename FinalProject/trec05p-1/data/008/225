Hi Rick

I met with Vince Kaminski last week in Houston.  The primary purpose for my
meeting was to introduce Algorithmics to his research team and identify any
opportunities for Algorithmics to add value to Enron's risk management
process.  Our discussion revealed a number of areas which are of interest to
Vince, namely counterparty default data and credit risk calculation
performance.  We agreed that the latter issue warranted a follow up
discussion and I'm working with Vince to co-ordinate this meeting.  As chief
risk officer for Enron, I thought you might find value in our offering, so I
have taken the liberty to send you an information package. Briefly,  Algo
specializes in providing clients with a consistent framework for risk
measurement and management across the entire organization - including
market, credit, liquidity and operational risk.  This is delivered through
our patented Mark-to-Future methodology - a combination of technology and
advanced financial engineering. 

To date we have about 120 clients world-wide (see URL link for details
http://www.algorithmics.com/corporate/clients/index.shtml

Other commodity and energy clients include, PG& E Corp. , Axia Energy,
Cemex, S.A.  Once you've had the opportunity to review the documentation, I
would be happy to   give you a short presentation on our solution. This will
help solidify the concepts illustrated in the information package.  


Best regards,

Peter Antoniadis
