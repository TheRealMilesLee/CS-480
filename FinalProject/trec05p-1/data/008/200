As Brian is away on vacation, I thought you may be able to assist me.

Brian Redmond does not have responsibilities in his profile for the MD prc.  I took Laura Luce's profile and changed the region to Texas and added Tech Services.  Do you think this is appropriate or can you offer any changes?

How's this?

"Responsible for negotiations, deal structuring and customer coverage for the Texas Region as well as managing the ENA Technical Services."
