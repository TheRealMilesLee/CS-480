Greetings, Comrades, and welcome back (for two thirds
of you, and for you first years:  don't forget to
breathe).

I am compelled (Diane Dimeff stands behind me with a
Louisville Slugger slapping menacingly against one
palm) to tell you that Haas has a Complaint
Department, namely the Student Advisory Committee
(SAC).  

The SAC is a formalized conduit for presenting the
School Administration with your thoughts, suggestions,
responses, recommendations, kisses and hugs of
appreciation as well as rants and rodomontades of
angry frustration on any subject with respect to your
experience at Haas.  We do this by means of the
Student Survey (more on this later), our distinguished
teacher awards (more on this later, too) and by
listening to you when all others have grown weary of
your whining.   

The Committee  currently consists of the following
students (we are looking for a couple of
representatives from among the first years, but more
on this later, as you probably suspected):

Eric Jordan, jordan@haas.berkeley.edu
Lesley Keffer, keffer@haas...
Sujan Punyamur, punyanur@haas...
Deepika Shah, dshah@haas...
Joseph Tambornino (me), Chairman, tamborni@haas...

Feel free to flag any of us down (especially Deepika
since she's the easiest to talk to) if you have a
gripe, a brainstorm, or a question about Haas that
Diane and her team have not already triaged for you. 
(Be forewarned, however: we will not reveal the secret
formula to Berk's Finance case.)

Best wishes in reacclimating yourself to school.  (At
least it gives you something to do if the dotcom bust
has left you "downsized," "rightsized," "laid off" or
otherwise dumped by your old employer.  Heck, who
needs them anyway?  Go start your own digital
revolution.)

JT
