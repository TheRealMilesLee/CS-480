Dynegy is refusing to sign confirmations for physical power transactions entered into via DynegyDirect and is amenable to entering into an agreement similar to the EOL Consent and Amendment.  I am comfortable with this solution for physical power.  Please let me know if you would like to cover financial transactions and/or physical gas in the attached agreement as well.  I'll leave it to you to discuss with your respective confirm desks whether Dynegy is making the same objections to executing written confirmation letters.

Please give me a call at your earliest convenience to discuss this matter in greater detail.

Regards,

Leslie
