Dear Students,

Izio is a Learning Management System that the Haas School is using in a 
pilot study. Two LMS systems are currently being evaluated, Izio and 
another one called Prometheus. Izio provides many useful tools to help you 
with your courses throughout the semester. To learn more about Izio, see 
http://support.convene.com/stud/index.htm

Also, be aware that the use of Izio is an "opt-in" choice for each faculty 
person.  That is, each faculty person may choose whether or not to use 
it.  Ask your instructor to find out if he/she is using Izio this semester.

For the Fall semester, Convene has released an enhanced version of our
learning management system called IZIO PRO.  You can access Izio Pro by
using the same URL as the previous version at http://haas.izio.convenve.com
By now most students should have received an email containing their login name
and password.

To avoid the duplicate accounts issue we encountered last semester, Convene
has created a method for creating accounts and posting student course
registration information from Haas and Berkeley Campus Systems of Records 
(e.g., EDULink, SIS/TeleBears).
Self registration has been removed.  CHANGES TO STUDENT REGISTRATION DATA
will be obtained from the Systems of Record and POSTED TO IZIO ONCE PER WEEK
UNTIL THE ADD/DROP PERIOD ENDS.

Convene has also changed the naming convention for Izio Pro accounts.  The
naming convention goes as follows, first initial_last name1.  This is a
locked field and cannot be changed by Haas Computing Services.  The Izio 
software does however allow for users to changed
their unique password.

As always Haas Computing Services is pleased to assist you with any support
issues if you contact the Help Desk at (510)642-0434,
mailto:helpdesk@haas.berkeley.edu, or http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu.


Thank You
