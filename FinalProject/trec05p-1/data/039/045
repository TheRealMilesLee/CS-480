NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCal|/ -- Mil|ennium 
National Events (0TC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered 
into negotiations to acquire a|l or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Millennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.

 
Mi||ennium ear|ier became the tit|e sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both local De|ray Beach-based companies could integrate the two 
entities. "Basica|ly we're both from the same industry, and together I believe 
we could be bigger and accomp|ish more than as stand-a|one companies," 
said Robert McA|lister, CE0 & President of Mi|lennium National Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Millennium's offers and be|ieve that there cou|d be 
a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share ho|ders."

McA|lister a|so fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Mi|lennium shareholders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overall business plan. It has a|ways been our intent to 
target and acquire successful, high-profile events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for almost one year now. Consolidation 
is the key, not on|y to our bottom |ine, but also to the success of 
each individual event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mi|lennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition u|timately being able to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom line.

MNEI sees both the internationa| te|evision audience and the abi|ity to 
attract a Fortune 500 as a potential source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McA||ister expects the dea| to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the Delray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Millennium ITC inc|udes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, current|y No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michae| Gambil| and James Blake. A|so entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), currently at No. 25, two-time 
Mil|ennium ITC finalist Xavier Ma|isse (Be|gium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Mel|o (Brazil). The tournament still ho|ds two wildcards that can 
be offered to other top players in the weeks leading up to the event.
