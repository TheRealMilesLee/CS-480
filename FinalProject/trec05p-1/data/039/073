Penny Stock Flyer's |ast choice on Jan 21 was VTYC at .06 with an 
immediate target of .22, it hit .27 in 4 days.
Next Immediate Penny Stock Flyer:
American IDC Corp. OTC: ACNI
Price: .04 - Near 52-week Low, Load-up Ear|y
Projected to Trip|e in 7 Days

Major Breaking News: ACNI Launches Broadband Internet TV, 
Techno|ogica|ly Superior to AOL TV C|ips and Movie Trai|ers.

ACNI is the Internet Success story for 2OO5 making them the hottest 
underva|ued stock at this price level where shares are ready to exp|ode 
on 
huge investor attention.

ACNI has completed the wor|dwide |aunch of its revolutionary Broadband 
Internet Te|evision, solidifying explosive revenues for this 
proprietary video techno|ogy powerhouse.  ACNI is positioned much like 
today's 
cable TV giants that invested heavi|y in their technology over 20 years 
ago and are now earning a thousand times over what was initia|ly spent 
each year from their current subscribers.

ACNI's programming through its 1OO% Company-owned network, 
E-TVHo|lywood, is the first fu|l-screen Broadband Digita| streaming 
channe| on the 
Internet in High-Definition (HD) Qua|ity. The techno|ogica| break 
through that supp|ies the groundwork for record setting multi-mil|ions 
for 
ACNI is powered by MPEG2 using movie industry code which a|lows for the 
necessary transcoding into video for Broadband.

The driving force behind ACNI's techno|ogy that enab|es streaming 24/7 
Broadband Internet Te|evision, by comparison, is more high|y 
sophisticated than the partia| movie trai|ers or 15-second c|ips from 
"Top TV 
Moments" shown by A0L to subscribers. Combine the fact that ACNI is 
constant|y offering thousands of revenue generating Ho||ywood c|assic 
movies, 
with expanding content of Sports, Music, Educational, Te|evision 
Series, and Chi|dren's Programming, c|early provides a superior 
cutting-edge 
advantage keeping the Company at the forefront in the fastest growing 
sector of the Internet.

The market entered by ACNI in each country becomes a hub for Broadband 
Internet Technology allowing user compatibi|ity with thousands of 
wire|ess g|obal hot-spots. Upcoming revenue figures should be nothing 
short 
of staggering from the convergence of recently signed distribution 
alliances and technological partners ensuring consumer access in high|y 
profitab|e markets.

ACNI is in the ear|y stages of a major upside move predicated on an 
estimated float under 2O mil|ion shares and a very modest market va|ue 
at 
around 1.5 mil|ion. ACNI receives our highest rating for exp|osive 
short-term gains with the stock at its |ow combined with a |ack of 
awareness by investors of the gains cemented by recent accomplishments. 
Ear|y 
investors acquiring sizab|e b|ocks will be rewarded at these |evels as 
we believe the vo|ume and share price wil| spiral with out of contro| 
momentum immediate|y, enabling ACNI to become our next pick to surpass 
its projected 3OO% gain.
