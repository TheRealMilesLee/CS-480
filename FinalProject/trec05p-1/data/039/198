I'm sorry to keep changing my mind, but I would now like to attend the 10/17 class.  Fran informed me of another Leadership training class that is on 10/31-11/02 that I would like to be able to attend.  Many thanks for your patience.  Kim.

Miranda,

Will it be possible to reschedule my time for this training?  I just learned that I will be out of town on Wednesday.  Do you have any time next week available?  I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause. 

Thank you,

Kim Watson.
