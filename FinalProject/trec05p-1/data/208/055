Audrey,

The other person I was talking about is Diana Scholtes.  She and I have
been working together for 5 years.  She has experience in the WSCC cash
markets, and has substantial middle-marketing skills and contacts in the
industry.  Her email is diana.scholtes@enron.com.  Her number is
503-464-3807.

Thanks,
Sean
