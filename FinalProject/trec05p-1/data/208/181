Subject:	Re: Transwestern Record Storage at Iron Mountain (Omaha)

Teb, As we discussed, the Omaha Iron Mountain storage facility contains some 198 boxes of Transwestern documents. These documents came from Transwestern/Houston originally and related to old certificate and rate filings. Because of the pending acquisition of Northern by Dynegy, Northern needs to isolate our storage records. Consequently, were asking you to retrieve and take ownership of the 198 boxes from the Omaha IM facility. This will involve having Houston Iron Mountain initiating the request for shipping from the Omaha facility and being responsible for the disposition of the boxes when they are received. The estimated shipping costs to Transwestern for the boxes would be approx. $2,200 - $2,400 . The box numbers for the Transwestern records were previously provided to you by letter dated 8/10/01. In addition, would you please provide me your cost center #, company #, GL account # and material # so that the box retrieval fee ($1/box) charged to Northern's account by the Omaha Iron Mountain facility can be cross-charged to Transwestern ? 

If you have any questions or if I can assist in facilitating this request, please give me a call. 
Thanks, 
Bob Thurber
