Here are the details from my conversation with Lonestar...

They will not burn off large imbalances in the winter due to pressure constraints.

As for selling off some off the imbalance base load, they have no problem with base loading 5 or 10, as long as we are capable of purchasing gas from spot suppliers if a cold front comes through and the plant begins to burn full capacity.  They will ask us to get on rate if that happens, if Tenaska burns the full 44,500, then we need to be putting that into the pipe, it cannot come from our length.  

Looks like they want us to stay on rate with the plant.  From looking at the plant's burns to this point, I think it would be safe to base load 5, and try to sell more each day to stay flat with the plant.  For the rest of January, you can try and sell some of that gas on the spot market.  The purchaser would need to buy it directly at the supply point and transport it away themselves.  

Let me know what you all need from me.  I am about to get supply points for February.
