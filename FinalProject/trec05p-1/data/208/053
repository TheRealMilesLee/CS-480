Hey Hunter,

I know I have been missing you for coffee lately but Rogers Herndon recommend I bounce a quick question off of you.  He mentioned that it was possible that if enough people bail from UBS there may be a spot there for me.  Do you think that it is possible that I could squeeze in? 

Jason
