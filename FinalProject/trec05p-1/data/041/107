Neal --

First, thanks for the materials, which we did recieve and which were very
helpful in putting meat on the bones of our conversation Wednesday.

Immediately following our conference call, we put out telephone calls to
trusted sources in Venezuela to help gather intelligence on the current
state of the Ministry's consideration of this matter, PDVSA's position, and
the timing for a presentation by the ministry to Chavez.

It is taking longer than we would like to gather this information, but we do
believe it is crucial before we recommend a course of action.  In the
meantime, perhaps we could ask you and your colleagues to put together the
substance of a letter that McLarty or Richardson could send to Chavez, as
our opening salvo in Enron's support.

We can be reached over the weekend at the following cellphone numbers in the
event that there are breaking developments:

Stephen Donehoo  202-262-0835
Nelson Cunningham  202-841-1132

Thanks, and we look forward to being in touch at the very beginning of next
week.

Nelson
