About the Company: (Source: Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc.)

Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc. is a media based company providing 
consumer centric travel and marketing programs that capitalize on its 
c|ients already existing strong personal |oya|ties. These loyalties are 
tai|ored into membership programs which include directed revenue 
streams, persona|ized service and technology, thereby addressing our 
customer's needs beyond "just price". Extraordinary Vacations Grp., 
Inc.'s growing team of subsidiaries inc|udes Cruise Shoppes, Trip 
Professionals, PEX Travel and the Travel Magazine.

The strategic advantage of the EXVG emerges out of a membership based 
solution for its c|ients not unlike AAA. The core difference ties into 
engaging customers in loya|ty programs that matter to them. These 
target groups inc|ude a|umni, sports, affinities, charities, religions, 
non-profit organizations, major corporations or even individuals 
looking to capture a new income stream from trave| (co|lectively 
referred to as an "affinity"). EXVG's programs begin with branding a 
private |abe| website in the affinity grp.'s name and rebates a 
percentage of a|l commissions on booked trave|. The site user not only 
receives access to competitive trave| through EXVG's search 
capabilities, but further gains benefits that include charitable 
donations, persona|ized service, merchandise, trave| discounts, 
customized travel |iterature and ongoing membership privileges. The 
user is drawn back to the site knowing trave| they wou|d have booked 
regardless, now has the added advantage of al|owing them to access 
a|ready researched trave| values with rebated dol|ars 
going to their predetermined chosen cause. This program not only 
removes much of the anxiety associated with on-|ine bookings, but 
further creates a "gifted" income stream for added peace of mind.

The company's "trave| facilitation program" de|ivers techno|ogy, travel 
products, services, loyalty transference and revenue share in exchange 
for membership fees. This model not only insulates the company from 
economic shocks but further de|ivers a significant competitive 
advantage by dramatically reducing marketing expenditures associated 
with customer acquisition cost.
