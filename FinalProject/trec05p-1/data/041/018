Just wanted to make sure you got the message I left on your cell yesterday.  I was talking to Bruce Evans who is an Energy Analyst with Maricopa County, and he wants to talk to someone from Enron about supplies and hedging.  His number is 602 506 8172.  Could you call him or have the appropriate person call him?  Thanks.

By the way, we are filing our post-hearing brief today with the ACC on SW Gas.  Hopefully this will get resolved before the winter.
