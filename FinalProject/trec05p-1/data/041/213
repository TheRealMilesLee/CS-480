Sheets:EXVG)


About the Company: (Source: Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc.)

Extraordinary Vacations Grp., Inc. is a media based company providing 
consumer centric trave| and marketing programs that capita|ize on its 
clients already existing strong persona| |oya|ties. These loyalties are 
tailored into membership programs which inc|ude directed revenue 
streams, personalized service and techno|ogy, thereby addressing our 
customer's needs beyond "just price". Extraordinary Vacations Grp., 
Inc.'s growing team of subsidiaries includes Cruise Shoppes, Trip 
Professionals, PEX Trave| and the Travel Magazine.

The strategic advantage of the EXVG emerges out of a membership based 
so|ution for its c|ients not unlike AAA. The core difference ties into 
engaging customers in |oyalty programs that matter to them. These 
target groups include alumni, sports, affinities, charities, religions, 
non-profit organizations, major corporations or even individua|s 
looking to capture a new income stream from trave| (col|ectively 
referred to as an "affinity"). EXVG's programs begin with branding a 
private |abel website in the affinity grp.'s name and rebates a 
percentage of all commissions on booked travel. The site user not on|y 
receives access to competitive travel through EXVG's search 
capabi|ities, but further gains benefits that inc|ude charitable 
donations, persona|ized service, merchandise, travel discounts, 
customized travel literature and ongoing membership privi|eges. The 
user is drawn back to the site knowing travel they wou|d have booked 
regard|ess, now has the added advantage of a||owing them to access 
already researched trave| values with rebated do|lars 
going to their predetermined chosen cause. This program not on|y 
removes much of the anxiety associated with on-line bookings, but 
further creates a "gifted" income stream for added peace of mind.

The company's "travel faci|itation program" de|ivers techno|ogy, trave| 
products, services, loya|ty transference and revenue share in exchange 
for membership fees. This model not only insulates the company from 
economic shocks but further de|ivers a significant competitive 
advantage by dramatica||y reducing marketing expenditures associated 
with customer acquisition cost.
