Dear Kevin Hyatt,  Over the past few months, 10K Wizard has been working on a new faster, easier to use, subscription-based site, which will be rolled out on September 1, 2001.  The new site will deliver:  * Unlimited Usage - search and download any and all SEC documents and attachments. No limits on the number of downloaded documents, no additional charges.  * Unsurpassed Speed and Reliability - 10K Wizard posts SEC Filings in real-time, fully indexed and ready to search.  * Unique Personal Alerting - Use the Alert Wizard to set up and send crucial information to your Email. You can be alerted not only on company symbols, but full text as well.  For example, you can set up an alert to notify you when the words "Warren Buffett" appear in any Insider Trading form.   * Streamlined Document Downloads - don't struggle with cut and paste, 10K Wizard automatically converts all text and HTML documents into MS-Word compatible documents for storage on your computer.  * Full Text Indexing and Searching - provides you with the most robust search capability and comprehensive results available in the market today.   As a current user of 10K Wizard, you can register today to receive the special introductory rate of $99.95 per year and fix your subscription rate for the second year!
