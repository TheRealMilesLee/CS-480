All Shippers Letter #02-033
Date:	3/15/02
Time:	11:00 a.m. MST

Subject: System Operations

The purpose of this letter is to inform Northwest's shippers of how it
intends to deal with the upcoming maintenance announced by Questar Pipeline
at Clay Basin and by Transwestern Pipeline at its La Plata facilities.

Questar Pipeline has announced it will shut in its Clay Basin facility from
April 2, 2002 through April 15, 2002 and will then perform withdrawal tests
on April 16 and 17, 2002.  During this time Northwest will have no access to
Clay Basin.  Additionally, Transwestern Pipeline has announced that its La
Plata Compressor facilities will be shut in from April 2 through April 5,
2002, and will accept no deliveries from Northwest Pipeline.

During the month of March north flow volumes through the Kemmerer compressor
have exceeded capacity on a regular basis.  With Clay Basin shut in,
Northwest's balancing flexibility will be significantly impaired.  Northwest
will have no place to inject excess gas south of Kemmerer and as a result
cannot physically accommodate overscheduled volumes.

If north flow volumes continue to exceed Kemmerer capacity during the
Questar and Transwestern maintenance, Northwest will take the following
steps to maintain the reliability and integrity of its system: reduce line
pack on the south end of its system prior to the maintenance; cut
north-flowing alternate gas at compressor station cut points from La Plata
to Meacham as necessary to mitigate high line pressures or overscheduling
through Kemmerer; take all necessary steps to ensure that gas deliveries
from receipt points south of the Meacham compressor closely approximate
confirmed nominations;  entitle for undertakes or overtakes, as appropriate;
and finally, if required, Northwest will issue operational flow orders.

If net scheduled volumes north through Northwest's Kemmerer Compressor do
not exceed physical capacity, Northwest will have much greater flexibility
during the Clay Basin and Transwestern shut-ins.  Northwest's customers can
help themselves and reduce the likelihood that Kemmerer will overschedule by
securing adequate gas from Canadian suppliers or by using their Jackson
Prairie storage during this work.

Northwest will make every effort to reduce the impact on its customers of
the Clay Basin and Transwestern shut-ins and will be monitoring the
situation closely.  Northwest will take every opportunity to relax system
restrictions in later cycles if north flow volumes moderate.  Northwest is
confident that if its customers respond prudently, the impact of the
Transwestern and Questar maintenance will be greatly reduced.

If you have any questions, please contact your Marketing Services
representative.
