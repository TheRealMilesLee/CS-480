With all the Pelican coaches out of town on Friday & Saturday of this week 
(March 15 & 16), our normal practice on those days will be cancelled.

However, we will have practice for anyone who can attend on SUNDAY, MARCH 17 
from 3:30-5:00 pm  on the West Field (where we practiced last Saturday).

Hope to see you there,

Coach Marc
