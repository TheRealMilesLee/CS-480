Have you been turned down from receiving a 
loan by a bank because of poor credit, no 
credit or bankruptcy?

Private Foundations are not interested in 
credit ratings, only demonstrated need.

IF YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE A GENUINE NEED, YOU 
CAN APPLY FOR A GRANT!

It is much easier to receive a grant by mail 
from a Private Foundation than a local bank, 
because they are much more lenient. Imagine 
getting a check, payable to you, in the mail! 
Money you never have to pay back!

WE WILL SHOW YOU HOW!
