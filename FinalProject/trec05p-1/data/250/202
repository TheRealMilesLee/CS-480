I am Mr. Li Le Song credit officer of the Foriegn 
Operations Dept. of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Taikoo Shing 
Branch.I have a obscured business suggestion for 
you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Colonel 
Sadiq Uday who was with the Iraqi forces and also 
business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 
calendar months, with a value of Nineteen millions Five 
Hundred Thousnd United state Dollars Only (USD$19,5M) in 
my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, 
even during the war early last year. 

Again after the war another notification was sent and 
still no response came from him. We later find out that 
the Colonel and his family had been killed during the 
war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further 
investigation it was also discovered that Colonel Sadiq 
Uday did not declare any next of kin in his,official 
papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And 
he also confided in me the last time he was at my office 
that no one except me knew of his deposit in my Bank. 
So, Nineteen millions Five Hundred Thousand United State 
Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever 
come forward to claim it. 

What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my 
country at the expiration 4 years   the funds will 
revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if 
nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, 
my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a 
foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Colonel Sadiq 
Uday so that you will be able to receive his funds.

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned 
out so that we shall come out successful. I have 
contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary 
document that will back you up as the next of kin to 
Colonel Sadiq Uday,all that is required from you at 
this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names 
and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. 

After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney 
will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure 
the necessary approval and letter of probate in your 
favor for the move of the funds to an account that will 
be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in 
the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized 
method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary 
documents.

Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all 
matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been 
transferred to your nominated bank account the sharing 
ratio is open for negotiation for you . Should you be 
interested please send me your full names and current 
residential address and I will prefers you to reach me 
on the email address below (lsong64song@yahoo.com.hk) and 
finally after that I shall provide you with more details 
of this operation.

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards

Mr.Li Le Song
