Sara,

I noticed that Citibank has sent in letters terminating their ISDA agreement, as well as a letter terminating their foreign exchange contracts.  Wouldn't the FX confirms be covered by the ISDA?  We certainly confirmed them as if they were.  

The date of the letter terminating FX confirms is 12/2/01, while the ISDA was terminated 12/3/01.
