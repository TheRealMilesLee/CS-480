   Word of the Day for Saturday March 16, 2002:

   peccadillo \peck-uh-DIL-oh\, noun:
   A slight offense; a petty fault.

     No  peccadillo is too trivial: we learn that the mogul once
     blew  his  top  because  his  laundry  came  back  starched
     (" 'Fluff and fold!' he screamed").
     --Eric  P. Nash, "High Concept," [1]New York Times, May 10,
     1998

     And  besides,  "what  do they say? 'Don't judge lest you be
     judged.' Everybody has their peccadilloes."
     --  "Tyson  has  a  friend  in his corner," [2]Irish Times,
     October 21,1999

     Child  of  a  dominant  mother,  victim  of  a guilt-ridden
     conscience,  [St.  Augustine]  wrote  bewilderingly haunted
     'Confessions,'   in   which   infantile  peccadilloes  like
     stealing  apples  and adolescent fumblings with instinctive
     sexuality are bewailed with all the anguish of a frustrated
     perfectionist.
     --Geoffrey  Parker,  "True  Believers,"  [3]New York Times,
     June 29, 1997
     _________________________________________________________

   Peccadillo   comes   from  Spanish  pecadillo,  "little  sin,"
   diminutive   of  pecado,  "sin,"  from  Latin  peccatum,  from
   peccare, "to make a mistake, to err, to sin." It is related to
   impeccable, "without flaw or fault."
