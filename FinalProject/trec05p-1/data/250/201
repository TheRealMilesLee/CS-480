Jennifer -

I haven't heard from Sam, so I don't know her status.  She got the same
e-mail everyone else did, so if I hear from her, Kim will give her an
assignment.

I'm forwarding your message to Kim so she can answer your question about the
pear dish.  We have not made it before, so I can't answer your question.

John

John,
Do we know if Sam is coming?  I am wondering on my assignment for the pears.
Also, have you and Kim made this before?  Would it be OK to make the pears
and sauce ahead of time or shall I bring it for preparation?
Thanks.
Jennifer
