Re: My request from you (In Confidence)


Dear Sir,
Forgive me for approaching you in this manner to discuss a
matter, which is very sensitive indeed. Had I another
alternative, I would have jumped at it. All I ask is that
you take some
time to hear me out.
I am presently representing an individual; Mr. Luigi
Morgera who is Italian and worked in the accounts
department of Parmalat until the financial scandal that
rocked the company became
common knowledge. His movements have since been restricted,
and he remains in Milan under house arrest until the
investigators can ascertain that he did not benefit
directly from the loss of money.
Before the news broke, most highly placed staff of the
company knew what was going to happen, and took steps to
secure their futures. My client moved millions of Euros to
safety. Late last year, I was able to come under direct
control of this funds, and we have now agreed 
that we must look for a party who will hold control and
invest these funds until the case against him is dropped.
This is why I approached you. I must say that we will
appreciate it if you give
my offer some thought. Naturally, you will be well
compensated for your role. 
I look forward to your response.
Best regards,
James Williams
