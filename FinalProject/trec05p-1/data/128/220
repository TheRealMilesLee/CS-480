Ok thanks Mary.   I was wondering if it had been paid since the invoice has an "accounts payable" stamp.

Denise, I have spoken to Richard Ring and Gloria Ogenyi, they assured me that it would be taken care of.  Thanks for your attention to the matter!

Gloria -

Could you please help us gather the facts on what the $12 MM Surety Bond currently being requested (#6131506) is for - is this PG&E?.  Mary informed me that funds ($36,000) may not be available, is this correct?  

It is my understanding that Credit, Services and Regulatory will be monitoring and processing bond requirements.  As such, I would like to know how this would impact EES' business and definitely want to be aware of any default situation prior to reading about it in the press.  

Thanks, 
Rogers
