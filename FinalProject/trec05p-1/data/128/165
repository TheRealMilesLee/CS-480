Kevin,

Attached is the Beta Agreement and as we discussed, it contains the beta
configuration and the test criteria as well as the changes that you and
Jarod had previously requested.  Let me know who the legal contact is and we
will work directly with them to get the agreement finalized by the end of
November.

Regards,

Milt
