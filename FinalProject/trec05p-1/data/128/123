Tana,

The instructions don't work, and quite frankly, I don't have the luxury of waiting for an IT guy to help me.  Is it possible for you to print out the Alcoa isda and fax it to me at the below fax number?  I need it on an urgent priority basis.  If you can't fax it to me, please let me know.

Thanks,

Limor

Limor,

The instructions below should help you find the access to get into the Financial Trading Agreement Database (where the ISDA information is located).   If you want to get into where the documents are actually stored online, you need to contact Moyez Lallani, and he can get you access to Livelink.  Tell him you are in Legal in New York and you need access ASAP.  Then just have your computer guy up there set up up an Icon.

Instructions:

From your Lotus Notes Workspace choose File - Database - Open.  This will bring up the Open Database Dialog (shown below).  In the Server drop down list, choose "ECTHOU_LN1/ECT".  Once this is selected, find and double-click on the "Legal" folder.  Next, in the Database list, find the "Financial Trading Agreements" database and double-click (or click Open).  The database will then be added to your Lotus Notes Workspace.
