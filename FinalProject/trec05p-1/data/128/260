Yes, the flow affects of the Station 2 tie-ins for Red Rock. The estimated flow I was showing on the outage report was 130 mmcfd, (per Eric Faucheaux Planning) and the actual affect is 180 mmcfd.

The tie-in for the Gray Co. I/C will call for a 2 day outage at P3. (11/29/01 to 12/01/01) Darrell is going to post something on it today.

I also had a WT2 outage on the report that the field was asking for. It showed a complete Station shut down for 24 hours. Darrell and I talked the field into moving it to next year. (Early March) If you have any questions let me know.

Jerry

Jerry, 
Was there anything for TW that came out of this meeting that we need to be aware of?

Thanks, Kim.
