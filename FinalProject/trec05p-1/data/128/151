Lauri:

Enron Corp. would like to reexecute the guaranty (everything the same but with proper date) so we will deliver a new guaranty and certificate.  We ask that upon receipt, you return the guaranty that you are now holding.

Thanks.

Sara

Lauri:

We are in the midst of obtaining the certificate.

Also, I just noticed that the effective date is missing the year "2001".
Would you like to insert it and we will initial?

Thanks.  Sara
