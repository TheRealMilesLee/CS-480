Yesterday I had a meeting with my staff to review recent events, including the revised earnings announcement last week, the merger agreement and anything else on their minds.  

Perhaps besides the field, this may be the largest concentration of long-tenured employees.   Their personal financial losses are tremendous, especially when considered against their annual compensation.   As might be expected, they express their frustrations and resentments with Enron management.  Still, I am struck by their ongoing commitment to ETS and doing their jobs.  They seem eager to have the opportunity to show our accomplishments to Dynegy when the time is right.   

They ask lots of questions.. most of which I could readily answer.  

Here are two that I could not answer.  I'm hoping HR can help me with responses:

- Prior corp. correspondence said that the Click at Home program is under review.  One employee reported that he tried to log in to order a computer this week and the system was unavailable.  They want to know whether this means that the program has been canceled.

- I received several questions about Savings Plan/ESOP loans.  Is there any requirement for accelerated loan payment if the value of the loan exceeds the current value of the savings plan account?
