BP Texas City, Texas is returning to normal operation on a 35,000-bpd catcracker and 24,000-bpd alkylation unit. These units were shut second week October for about a 4 week maintenance program. BP continued to run its other 2 cats rated in total at 175,000-bpd and other 40,000-bpd alkylation unit. BP now plans mid-Jan to idle 1 of 2 reformers rated at 80,000-bpd mid-Jan for 4-5 wks. Last week in Feb, one of two crude units rated at about 220,000-bpd for 6-8 weeks. The other crude unit, about the same capacity will remain up. The other 60,000-bpd reformer will remain up during the Jan outage.
