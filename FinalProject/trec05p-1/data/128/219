Denise, I have spoken to Richard Ring and Gloria Ogenyi, they assured me that it would be taken care of.  Thanks for your attention to the matter!

Mary, who told you we would not pay for this bond?

Gloria -

Could you please help us gather the facts on what the $12 MM Surety Bond currently being requested (#6131506) is for - is this PG&E?.  Mary informed me that funds ($36,000) may not be available, is this correct?  

It is my understanding that Credit, Services and Regulatory will be monitoring and processing bond requirements.  As such, I would like to know how this would impact EES' business and definitely want to be aware of any default situation prior to reading about it in the press.  

Thanks, 
Rogers
