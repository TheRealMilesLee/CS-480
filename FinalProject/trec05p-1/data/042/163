Compliments,

This is a proposal in context but soliciting for your unreserved
assistance in carrying out
an urgent transaction. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang
Seng Bank Ltd.

Please you did not get this email in error; I had to search for your
contact myself on the
internet. What I require of you is your trust for what I want to expose
to you.
Before the Unfortunate tsunami disaster a client with my bank General Ibrahim
Moussa who was with the
Indonesia forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 12
calendar months,
When the money matured several notice were sent to him,but all our
efforts to contact
the general proved abortive.

After the unfortunate Tsunami crisis another notification was sent
and still no response
came from him.I
later found out that the General and his family had been killed
during the Tsunami tragedy .

Through my personnal association with the general and his confiding
in me as his personnal accountant
I found out that he did not declare any next of kin in his official
papers including the paper work of his
bank deposit.

And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one
except myself knew of his deposit in my bank.

No doubt this proposal will make you apprehensive, please I employ you
to observe complete
confidentiality and be assured that this transaction would be most
profitable to both of us
so please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters of this
issue. You may reply
to my email wangqin_1111@yahoo.com. if you agree to help.

There is no stress involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt
a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary
documents.

I will provide you with more details of this operation.Your earliest
response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards,

Mr Wang Qin.
