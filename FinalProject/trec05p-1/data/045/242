The Datek Difference
Are we in it for the money? Not when it comes to "payment for order 
flow"--an industry practice that can create conflicts of interest 
between brokerage firms and their clients. Learn how Datek's dynamic 
Auto Routing bucks this system--and also lets us rebate millions to 
our customers. 

Where we stand on "Payment for Order Flow":

The Learning Curve
There sure is a lot of talk about over and under in the stock market. 
For example, technical analysts (chartists) look for stocks that are 
either over bought or over sold. And value investors seek stocks that 
are undervalued, in the hopes that they'll soon become fairly valued 
(or even over valued!). But one of the lessons we soon learn is that 
these terms are always relative, and that historical comparisons can 
be misleading. To help make sense of valuations these days, take a 
useful look at "It's All Relative" from Smart Money University.*
