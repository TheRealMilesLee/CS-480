I have a dream to fight and free my people from age long captivity and slavery not from the western world anymore but from fellow African=2E I have watched from birth with pain and absolute agony how my people are being subjected to neglect=2C poverty=2C illiteracy=2C hunger and starvation=2C oppression and intimidation=2C untold hardship and suffering=2C constantly there is power and authority on the side of their oppressors while my people watch helplessly=2E

Now is about 45 years Nigeria got independent and yet we are very much dependent on the western world for food=2C water=2C electricity even air we breath=2E Everyday our leaders are just concentrating all their energy in looting the national treasury=2C now they have developed a competitive spirit on who will loot highest=2C all these fund looted from my country are siphoned abroad into western world who use it to improve on their economy and the life of their citizens while my people leave in slums and mosquito infested areas without food to eat=2C education has gone down the drain while hospital is non-existent and where they do exist it is for the same ruling class=2C youths are roaming the streets while there is no hope for the whole nation=2E

The people ruling Nigeria now are the same evil men dressed in uniform of brutality who have transformed themselves as angels of light while in reality they are dangerous wolves  in sheep clothing=2E This is an appeal to every lover of humanity=2C equity and fair play=2C justice and rule of law=2E I am very much of the fact that it is appointed onto men once to die but what we left on the planet earth will live generations after we must have  gone and so any contribution we made now will not only make a difference for now  but generations yet to come will write our names on marbles and gold=2E Any help rendered to Nigerian is a help for Africa and any help for Africa is a help for humanity=2E

I have sat down and laid plan how to wrestle power out of the hands of these evil men that have ruined our country since independent but I cannot do it alone and so I needed  every help I can get from all concerned mind both financially and otherwise to make this happen and I am very confident that I will arrive safely by the strength of God Almighty=2E

I wait to hear from you soonest how you can assist in this noble venture=2E

Sincerely yours=2C
Churchil=2E
