Since the Corporate Sponsors Reception is a new event, I am sure that you 
have numerous questions.  Please feel free to call or email me directly 
with any questions or concerns that you may have.

In hopes of anticipating some of your questions, I offer the FAQ below:

WHY IS THE EVENT IN BERKELEY, AND NOT SAN FRANCISCO?
I received 43 responses from students regarding the proposed location of 
the event. 23 wanted to have the event at Haas, 20 wanted the event in 
SF.  Since this was very close to a 50/50 split we also looked at the 
number of students who have class on Tuesday evenings - approximately half 
of the student body.  Given the simple majority of declared preference and 
the desire to have maximum attendance, we chose the Haas location.

WHO SHOULD I INVITE?
We will be giving each student two invitations to extend to managers.  We 
suggest that you invite your direct supervisor and your benefits/human 
resources manager.  Please use your best judgement.

WHAT SORT OF TRANSPORTATION ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE TO MY MANAGER?
We will provide free parking to those who indicate that they will be 
driving to the event. If your manager is going to join you on the shuttle 
bus from the South Bay, Peninsula or BART, you MUST tell us in advance so 
that we can ensure adequate capacity for students and guests. Shuttle buses 
will run on their normal schedule - so managers using this option will 
commit to spending a long evening on campus.

ARE TUESDAY CLASSES CANCELLED?
No, if you have class on Tuesday, please attend your class as usual.  The 
reception will be during your class break. Your managers can join you at 
that time, either after attending the seminar, or having just arrived on 
campus.

CAN I BRING MY MANAGER TO MY TUESDAY CLASS?
The program office is not opposed to this option, but you MUST tell us if 
you intend to do so.  We will then be able to make sure that there are 
enough seats for enrolled students and also that the faculty member does 
not object.
