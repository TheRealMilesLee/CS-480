Roddy Hayslet,

    Don't feel obligated to respond??  You have to be kidding!  How are you?
What a wonderful surprise to find an e-mail from you.  It has been entirely
too long but Cherry does a good job of keeping me up to date.

It sounds like life has been good to you. You have a steadfast marriage and
a growing family. As I recall you had the heartache and the bumps early in
life. My crisis hit
in my mid thirties. You are correct, it was no bed of roses.

Let me see, I love to travel. My family and I have traveled to the East
coast for the past 6 years. I have become a
real Colonial History lover. I have really enjoyed taking my
grandson, Ethan, along. He and my son Garett are 6 months apart ( let's not
discuss that one...).  They have developed a passion for this as well, not
bad for 10 year olds.

Being a mother has always been my first love, being a grandmother is magic.
I have 2 wonderful grandchildren and
3 great kids. It does seem a little odd I suppose. We tend to see one
another as we were years ago.

Gosh, this was so nice.  Thank you for thinking of me...you are one special
guy!

Love,
Malinda
