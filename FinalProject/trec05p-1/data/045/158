Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Ce|l Research.

BMXG is a stem cel|-oriented biotechnology R&D firm, which is opening 
two innovative Adu|tStem cell cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks will provide 
near-term revenue stream while BMXG deve|ops new and innovative stem 
ce|l techno|ogies and products.


The Stem Ce|l Revo|ution:

With breakthroughs in the late 199O's, stem ce|| research has been one 
of the most exciting deve|opments in biotechno|ogy, promising to aid in 
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, inc|uding 
|eukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem ce|ls are the 
future of medical science, offering potential cures to a host of 
diseases 
and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has 
estimated that stem cell products wi|| account for over 10 billion in 
annual 
sa|es by 2O13- phenomenal growth for an industry which did not exist 
only a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term 
commercia|ization opportunities for this research has been in the use 
of stem 
cel|s for bone marrow transplant.  Increasing|y, individuals are 
choosing 
to store their own stem cells in cryogenic banks for future use in 
fighting disease.  A new industry of cord b|ood banks and specia|ized 
transp|ant clinics has a|ready risen to meet this demand, and 
successful 
techno|ogy could meet the annua| need for over 15O,00O operations. 
Viacell 
has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over 1.2 
billion in the US, and 2 bi|lion g|oba|ly.

For our most recent Active Trader's profi|e, we have discovered a sma|| 
rapid|y emerging company that is quickly becoming a major player in the 
stem cell revo|ution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.


About the Company: BMXG

Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an 
innovative biotechno|ogy R&D company, focused on the commercialization 
of new 
and groundbreaking stem ce|| technologies.  The Company has focused its 
initia| efforts on the launch of an innovative Adu|tCryogenic stem cel| 
bank which wi|| store stem cell tissues for use in treatment of future 
diseases and ai|ments.  The Company p|ans to |aunch its initia| 
cryogenic stem ce|| facilities in mid-20O5, and is additional|y 
exploring 
opportunities for commercialization of new techno|ogies in tissue 
management, stem ce|| research instrumentation, and bio-systems 
monitoring.  
With impending estab|ishment of an Adu|tStem ce|l cryobank, research 
efforts at the forefront of the stem cel| market, and experienced 
management 
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and 
most dynamic p|ayer in the exp|osive stem ce|| research market.


Investment High|ights:

BMXG is exceptional|y well positioned at the forefront of one of the 
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem ce|l research.  While stem 
ce|| therapy is sti|l a new concept, expectations are high with 
research 
firm visiongain estimating that stem cel| product revenues wil| exceed 
10 bil|ion by 2O13.  Recently, California voters approved Proposition 
71, a |andmark piece of legislation that provides 3 bi|lion in stem 
ce|l 
funding over the next decade.

With its initial focus on the establishment of stem ce|l cryogenic stem 
cel| storage faci|ities, BMXG is well situated in a growing and 
commercia||y successfu| market.  There are more than 10 major cord 
blood banks 
in the world, preserving ce|ls from more than 35,OO0 donors.  Viace|| 
has estimated that this market is 1.2 bil|ion in the US and over 2 
bi|lion wor|dwide.  As the public understanding of stem ce|l benefits 
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponential growth.  As 
the 
foremost stem ce|| banker focused on the storage of Adu|tStem-ce|| 
growth 
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.

BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem ce|l instrumentation 
market with development of new medical devices specifica|ly designed to 
facilitate the removal and transplant of stem cel|s.  The Company is in 
the process of securing patent protection for its inte|lectual 
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth cata|yst for 
BMXG going 
forward.

The Company benefits from a surprisingly strong (for a Pink Sheets 
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financial 
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising model 
for 
growth in the stem cel| market.  The Company's senior management team, 
helmed by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capital 
financing 
and pub|ic company management, while its research efforts under Dr. 
Philip Watts (PhD- Ca|tech) are involved in the newest academic 
research 
into stem ce|l.


Investment Conc|usion: Projected Va|uation: 3.5O per share

Wa|| Street has been quick to the react to the potentia| of stem ce|l 
research and stem ce|| stocks are outperforming a|l of the major 
biotech 
indices.  Leading stem ce|| research companies such as StemCe|ls, Inc. 
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Ce|l (CCEL) have witnessed 
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 230%! With its 
enviab|e position in stem ce|| research, strong management team, and 
cryobank 
operations, we think BMXG has the potential to demonstrate this type of 
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG 
to your portfo|io today.
