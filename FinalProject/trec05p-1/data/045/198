Elizabeth,
FYI,

Some additional information for you that you may need to know.

On item 3. F & G - A comment data field for operational capacity updates was added to TMS around the 13th or 14th of August. The way this field works is as follows: If the Operational Capacity Volume is updated during the allocation process, the reps. must enter a comment. TMS is now storing the comments. Also, the operational capacity changes made during the I/D 1 and I/D 2 cycles do not get sent back to CAS, so we should not have the issue with the flow rate calculation being posted as operational capacity. The CAS system is also tracking comments if the reps. update the operational capacity in that system. Basically the comments could be stored in both systems. If you need this data, we will need to go the Tina Dunnaway for CAS or Hasan Kedwaii for TMS. 

Let me know if you need anything or if I can help coordinate getting this information.

Thanks Ramona

Now that the latest round of TW's negotiated rate hearing is behind us, we can re-focus our attention on the monthly reporting requirements imposed by the FERC on July 25, 2001.  Please review the attached document that addresses all the issues that were raised in prior meetings and provide your comments by COB September 7, 2001.  

I will then work with Don Powell to gather/compile the data required for the September 30th filing and distribute to the primary reviewers by mid-month.  Once the reviewers have had an opportunity to analyze the data, we can distribute for review and discussion.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
