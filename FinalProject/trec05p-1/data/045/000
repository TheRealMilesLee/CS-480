louise, i dont think i can be the EOL guy for the floor. Its just not going to work like the Zie projects. They have other priorities and a different attitude. I you want to talk about it give me a call or we can talk next monday. 

The Zie projects are coming along fine: Basis Opts port calc is done and being tested by us. Flex deal viewer coming along, probably done by the end of the month. Transport Options and Option reports are under development. Going to talk to Zie about Sitara reliability cause we will have a trader revolt if it crashes again.
