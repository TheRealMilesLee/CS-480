EOTT ENERGY ANNOUNCES RECAPITALIZATION PLAN 

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Friday, Sept. 7, 2001

HOUSTON - EOTT Energy Partners, L. P. (EOTT) announced today a recapitalization plan which includes the conversion of all outstanding subordinated units and additional partnership interests (APIs) into common units and the implementation of a refinancing plan.   Upon successful completion of the plan, the board of directors of its general partner, EOTT Energy Corp., intends to increase the annual cash distribution on common units from $1.90 to $1.95.   Elements of the plan require unitholder approval, which will be sought later this year.
"We believe that the plan enhances the value of EOTT's common units and places our common unitholders in a position to realize immediate benefit from increases in the partnership's available cash," said Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of EOTT.

Conversion of Subordinated Units into Common Units
A key component of the plan is the conversion of all subordinated units to common units.  Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) and Koch Petroleum Group, L.P. (Koch) have agreed to convert all 9.0 million outstanding subordinated units and $9.3 million of APIs into approximately 
4.3 million common units.  These changes in capital structure are expected to enhance EOTT's ability to increase cash distributions to its common unitholders.  An amendment to the partnership agreement will be required to affect this conversion.  

Financings
	As part of its recapitalization plan, EOTT intends to affect equity and long-term debt offerings to refinance short-term debt incurred in connection with its $117 million asset acquisition completed in June 2001.  It also intends to replace its existing working capital credit facility with a new facility with lending institutions.  An amendment to the partnership agreement is not required for the financings, which are anticipated to be completed by year-end.

Unitholder Approval and Proxy
	The amendment to the partnership agreement must be approved by a favorable vote of holders of at least two-thirds of each of the outstanding common units and subordinated units.  Additional details regarding the recapitalization will be included in proxy materials to be mailed to unitholders this fall. Lehman Brothers acted as sole financial advisor to EOTT on the recapitalization.
