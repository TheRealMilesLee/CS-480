Attached please find the issue papers we discussed in our meeting in Cheyenne.  We apologize for the delay in getting this material to you.  A number of our folks were tied up in the California mess (only one week left for their session!!).  

 

We have also taken the liberty of drafting a suggested agenda for a FERC meeting.  The agenda includes the issues we discussed in our meeting--with the exception of our discussion of the next FERC commissioner.  

 

As always, please feel free to contact Sue Landwehr, me or Steve Kean with any questions or concerns.  We look forward to continuing our dialogue on these important issues.  

Thanks!
