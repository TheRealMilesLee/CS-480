    Sweets, can you please call Wil Eanes at Allstate (713-942-8989) when
you get some free time and ask him how we can make sure the Lexus will be
covered next week when we go to pick it up on the 13th.  What information
does he need from us?  Can you get it from Chris and give to him as I would
prefer to have the car covered before I start driving it around.  Luv, The
Wif

I talked to both Carmax and Honda and basically all we need to do is go in
(before 5pm so Carmax can talk to Honda) and bring your info for the loan.
They call Honda and get a payoff which is $4050.10 and then cut us a check
for the difference.  We should probably do that about 4pm on the 13th then
we can go pick up theL exus from Dorland.
