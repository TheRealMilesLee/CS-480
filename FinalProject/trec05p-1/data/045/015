Ben,

Blotter has a selection that needs to be checked in order to display EOL deals.
The system shows that you don't have that check box checked.
If that's the problem than all that you need to do is to check that box:

1. In Blotter use the "Clear" button to clear any deals that may already show.
2. Go to "Defaults" on the menu.
3. Select the only option there ("Startup/New Deals Defaults...")
4. Make sure you have "Show EOL Deals" checked.

 

If this is not the issue, please give me a call at 5-7265.

Thanks!
Nikolay
