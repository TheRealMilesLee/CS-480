Effective immediately Enron will begin moving all wireless devise accounts to individual employees for payment.  With all the changes currently taking place within Enron, this change will allow each user to experience uninterrupted service and keep communication flowing while at the same time allow the individual user greater accountability for these controllable expenses.  

Cell Phones and Pagers
Over the next few weeks Enron will be changing the employee payment method of cell phones and pagers, regardless of the vendor.  Optimum base rates and terms of service will be negotiated with pager and cell phone providers for the Houston area.  

All Cingular and non-Cingular accounts will be rolled under one agreement (see below for Nextel users).  (Field locations are excluded from this change and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis as appropriate.)  For billing purposes, this action will require all cell phone users to have the device and service put in their name.  While the phone will be in the employee's name it will be backed by Enron, therefore a personal credit check will not be required and you will not be required to sign a contract.  This change will allow each user to verify their bill for accuracy and to ensure that the bill is paid on time.  

All monthly charges for cell phone and/or pagers are to be submitted for reimbursement via XMS.  Direct billing and/or group billings will be phased out over the next few weeks.  XMS training and class schedules will be forthcoming.  

Please follow the steps below to make the necessary changes to your account:
·	Contact your service provider and make arrangements to have your bill paid monthly either by credit card or personal check.  The Cingular contact is Charlotte McGowan, (972) 706-1968.  If you need information regarding contacts for other providers, please contact Darin Lee Carlisle @ Global Strategic Sourcing ext - 5-3808.  
·	Submit the expense item to your supervisor for reimbursement through XMS.
·	Do not sign a contract, as you will become personally liable for the account for the life of the contract.
·	Change the address on your bill to either your home address or your current office address to ensure timely receipt of the invoice in the future.

Nextel Phone/Two-Way Radios
We are currently working with Nextel to restructure billing to individual employees.  All monthly charges for Nextel services will be submitted for reimbursement via XMS.  Pre-approval by Business Unit CAO will be required for all Nextel phone/two-way radios.

Long Distance
An individual code will be assigned to each Houston based employee for use when dialing long distance calls.  These codes will create individual accounts for each employee so that they can identify their long distance usage and reimburse the company for personal calls they may make. (Field locations are excluded at this time.)  

Conferencing
WorldCom will provide all audio conferencing services.  Monthly conferencing charges will be reviewed and approved by Department heads.  Training will follow under separate cover.

Training / Questions
Training sessions and additional communications regarding these changes will follow in the next few days.  Please contact Darin Carlisle at (713) 345-3808 or Peter Goebel at (713) 345-3325 with any questions regarding the above changes.  Questions regarding XMS training should be directed to Tammy Hopkins at (713) 345-3631.
