Hey it's me again... I still can't fix my email so I keep using my friends, she's getting mad at me but oh well ;-)) 
Anyways I went to the store the other day and met a cute girl, her name is Linda, and we started chatting 
for a while and then became friends :-)... She's going to come by my place today, she'll say hi to you on my 
webcam ;-) .... Cya there, oh and my page is at http://aebjaljucgu.salvationarmie.com/ju1/ if you forgot .....

Kisses, bye... Julie
