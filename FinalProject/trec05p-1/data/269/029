The cutover of the SCADA system and associated databases from St. Rose to Hayes Road was completed last night. According to ChevronTexaco, the control system and databases are functioning properly. However, the direct connection to our pipeline data is not available this morning. ChevronTexaco is investigating, and I will provide an update when the problem is resolved.
 
Thanks,
