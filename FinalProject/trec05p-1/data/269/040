Are you tired of Public Companies without anything substantial backing their story - how about a revolutionary invention that will change the Security industry forever, and the company just went public!!!

Company Name: snif fex inc 
Ticker: SN FX

Rating: Strong Buy

industry: Security, Homeland Security, Cargo Screening and EDS

Reason for the TOP 2005 Rating: Unique Exp losive Detection Device Capable of finding its targets from tens or hundreds of meters!!! There is no other EDS device which is so powerfull that can locate almost any explosve behind concrete walls from distance of tens of meters!!

The Competition: There are many companies in the industry of Sniffing exp losives, some of them are public and they are companies like iSON HWPR or HiET and all of them have devices which can locate exp losive from 10 inches, 1 feet, 2 feet or close to that. Compared to these results SN FX device is tens of times better and smaller in size and yet CHEAPER!!


"SN FX announced the release of snif fex Version 1.1, a handheld exp losives detection device which the Company claims can locate nitro-based exp losives from a distance of 10 to 100 feet depending on the quantity of the exp losive and environmental conditions. The Company also stated that, to the best of their knowledge, snif fex is the first device of its kind that can operate from such distances and find exp losives behind barriers."

Could this company be amongst the top deals on wallstreet this year!!! YES its trading at only 75 cents now and this brand new stock could be $3-4 easily in the next few weeks as the story unfolds!!

SN FX is in process of presenting the new device in USA and to Worldwide Markets and as soon as they receive some substantial orders and feedback from big institutional clients, this stock will fly in the skies, as an example iSON traded almost 1 billion dollars after they announced they are in process of developing some device, and SN FX already has the device and it proved it works in numerous tests!!



Company Name: snif fex inc 
Ticker: SN FX

Rating: Strong Buy

This stock is going to be the hottest issue for the summer!!
