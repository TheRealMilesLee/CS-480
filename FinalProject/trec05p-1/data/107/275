In their final debate in the race for Governor and on the day that he 
received the endorsement of every major newspaper in the New Jersey area, 
Jim McGreevey once again showed that he is the clear choice to lead New 
Jersey.

Jim McGreevey demonstrated throughout the debate that he will fight for New 
Jersey's families, and that he shares their values on critical issues facing 
our state. Jim McGreevey is the right choice to improve public schools, not 
abandon them.  He is the clear choice to make government more accountable, 
not make reckless promises to drive up State debt.

He will provide the leadership necessary to ensure the safety and security 
of our people. He will fight for drivers, not let auto insurance companies 
decide how to control rates.  He will protect a woman's right to choose; not 
restrict it.  He will continue to protect New Jersey's tough gun laws and he 
will fight any attempt to weaken those laws.

On Election Day, voters will have a clear choice regarding who will provide 
the right leadership for New Jersey's future. Jim McGreevey has shown time 
and time again that he is the clear choice for governor, and he will provide 
the responsible leadership this state deserves.
