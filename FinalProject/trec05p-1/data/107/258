DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS AND ENERGY
PRETORIA,
SOUTH AFRICA.

Kindly reply: fr_zamaye@yuku.org

Dear Friend,
It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on  behalf of my
colleagues.I have decided to seek a  confidential co-operation   with you 
in the execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and
hope  you will keep it confidential because of the nature  of the
business.

Within the  Department of Minerals and Energy where I work as an Assistant
Director of audit,with the co-operation of two other top officials,we have
in our possession an overdue contractor payment in   US  Dollars funds.The
said funds  represent certain percentage of the
contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign  
contracting firm,(Pearls Ltd) which we the officials over-invoiced to the
amount of US$15,200,000  (Fifteen Million Two Hundred Thousand US
Dollars).Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign
contractors all debts   owed,so as to maintain good relations with foreign
governments and non-governmental agencies,we included our bills for
approvals with the  Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South
Africa (RBSA).We   are 100% sure of funds approvals to anyone or company
we (The Audit   Committee) recommend as part of the sub-contractors who
did jobs for the Department.

We are seeking your assistance to front as the sub-contractor of the
unclaimed funds,since we are  not allowed to operate foreign  
accounts.Details and  change of beneficiary information upon   application
for claim to reflect payment and approvals will be secured  on behalf of
you/your Company.

My colleagues and I are prepared to give you US$2.5m while we take US$7.4m
and the balance of US$5.3m for taxes and   miscellaneous expenses
incurred.

This business is completely safe and secure,provided you treat it with
utmost confidentiality.It does not matter whether you/your Company does
contract projects,as a transfer of rights will be secured in favour of
you/your Company through the Federal High Court of South Africa before we
can proceed.

I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not  disappoint
us.Kindly notify me immediately via my alternative email
(fr_zamaye@yuku.org) for further details upon your acceptance of this
proposal.

Yours Faithfully,
Frank Zamaye(Mr)
