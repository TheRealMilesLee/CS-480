Lynn,

Just to let you know that one of the imbalances that kicked out I did figure it out(believe it or not);I have run nominated reports and scheduled quantities reports for all of Axia's contracts so that Kathy and myself can look at those on Monday to make sure everything looks alright.

The final for 10/27 I was able to figure out and everything was fine.  I will get this "final" down if it kills me!

John,
Karen asked me to send you a note about the problems we encountered 
with the final AM processing for 10/26.

When Karen submitted the rollover for the first time, it kicked out
two imbalances.  One, she was able to figure out with Kathy's help
and the other one she cannot.

The shipper on  K# 62418 nom 78172  at Demarc to K# 22252 during the ID2 cycle.
They were scheduled at 75177.
Shipper K# 22252 modified his gas from Demarc (from K#62418) to different storage.
However, he re-nom at the full 78172, not the amount that was scheduled from ID2,
which was 75177.  Shipper K# 62418 did not make any changes to this package.

If we just looked at the nom screen , everything is tied out.
However, we have to consider what's was scheduled.  In this case,
the scheduled number for K#62418 did not match the final am nomination
on K#22252.

After this transaction was invalidated (K#22252), the system
kicks out another imbalance, since K#22252 was realigning storage
gas to K# 22319, and we did not invalidate that change.

Karen also had some problems with not seeing the apply button.
I think Kathy walked her through the process since I did not.
We restarted the final AM process after the Timely allocation
and completed the cycle around 2pm.

Please call if you have questions/concerns.
Thanks,
Joe
