Matt,

Here are a couple of links that might be helpful for planning your ski trip. 
  Could you also please forward this email on to Ted.  I forgot to copy him 
on my email last time that gave my forwarding info and I don't recall his 
last name.  He is planning to be in park city with some friends this winter 
and wanted to get in touch w/ me.
Let me know if you have any questions regarding park city.  I think the 
parkcity info website has some info on Sundance, you just have to dig 
through there to find it.
Take care,
Mo
