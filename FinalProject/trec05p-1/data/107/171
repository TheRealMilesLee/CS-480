 contractors all debts owed=2C so as to maintain good relationship with foreign governments and non-government agencies=2C we included our bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the South Africa Reserve Bank =28SARB=29=2E We are seeking your assistance to front as beneficiary of the unclaimed funds=2C since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts=2E

 utmost confidentiality=2E It does not matter whether you=2Fyour Company
 does contract projects=2C as a transfer of powers will be secured in favour of you=2Fyour Company=2E Also=2C your area of specialization is not a
