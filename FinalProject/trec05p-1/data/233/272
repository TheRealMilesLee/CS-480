FROM THE DESK OF MR MOHAMMED BUBA.
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER
BANK OF AFRICAN .
OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO.
WEST AFRICA


Dear,friend

HOW are you,first i will explain my self in brief for you before we 
proceed.I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance 
department of BANK OF AFRICA (BOA) I am writing to Seek your interest over a 
business , In my department we dis
covered an abandoned sum of $20m US dollars ( twenty million US dollars).

In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer ( MR. ANDREAS 
SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany) who died along with his entire family in 
Monday, 31 July, 2000,   a plane crash.


http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm


Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless his 
next of kin or relative applies for it as next of kin or relation to the 
deceased as indicated in o
ur banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next 
of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody 
behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in my 
department now decided to excape with the fund,and as such we vial to make 
this business proposal to you so that my bank will release the fund into 
your account as the next of kin
to our bank deceased customer for safety and subsequent disbursement since 
nobody is coming for claims and we don't want this money to go into the bank 
treasury.
Infact i know the fund will not even go into the bank treasury,but our top 
bank officials(directors)will only share it among themselves into their 
accounts.

The Banking law and guideline here in burkina faso stipulates that if any 
customer account or property remains unserviceable or dormant,and unclaimed 
after five years, the account will be confiscated and transfered into the 
Bank treasury as unclaimed bill.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by 
the fact that the customer was a foreigner and Burkinabe cannot stand as 
next of kin to a foreigner.

We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner,in 
respect to the provision of a foreign account,and your imense contribution 
to champion the course of transfering the fund to your account. 10 % will be 
set aside for expenses incurred
by the both party during the business and 60 % would be for me and my 
colleagues.
There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement 
according to the percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable my bank transfer the fund into your account,i will send 
to you the text of application which you will send to my bank as next of kin 
to the deceased customer and that will be when you indicate your interest in 
the business, you must a
pply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of our bank deceased 
indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone 
and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in 
the money will be remitted .

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of 
the application.
I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is risk-free 
and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required 
informations will be perfectly made for you to champion the course of the 
transaction with my bank without any
hitch or risk .

You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.
Trusting to hear from you immediately.

Your's sincerely,
MR MOHAMMED BUBA.
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER(BOA)
