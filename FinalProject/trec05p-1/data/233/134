I personally therefore appeal to you seriously and religiously for your urgent assistant to move this money into your country where I believe it will be safe since I cannot leave the country due to the restriction movement imposed on the members of my family by the Nigerian Government.

Once you indicate your interest to assist me in this transaction I will give you my family Lawyer contact phone and fax numbers with the Chambers address who will arrange with you for face to face meeting out side Nigerian in order to liaise with you toward effective completion of this transaction since my movement is restricted and my telephone conversation is being monitored.

However, arrangements have been put in place to move this money out of the country in the secret vault through a security company to abroad and as soon as you indicate your interest, myLawyer shall send you the Air Bill of the Luggage and other related documents sothat you can help to claim the Luggage.

Conclusively, we have agreed to offer you 30% of the total sum, while 60% is to be held on trust by you until we decide on a suitable business investment in your country and more also 10% is mapped out for internal and external expenses. Subsequent to our free movement by the Nigerian Government. Please, reply urgently and treat with absolute  confidentiality and sincerity.

Best regards,

MRS. MARIAM ABACHA
