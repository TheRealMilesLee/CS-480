Today's Hottest Travel Deals from Bestfares.com!


This week, as we stated in our last email, many airfares took off. Many almost doubled. The good news is that we have been able to keep most of our lower fares in place. Many of the major airlines were charging $569 roundtrip to Hawaii earlier this week, but now the published fare is over $1,000 roundtrip. Our fares, however, are still under $600 roundtrip. Our free stopover in London plus two free nights' in a three-star hotel in London program has been extended for purchase through January 24, 2002. Our take a friend to a Mexican beach for 50 percent off through February 28, 2002 promotion is still available and our coast-to-coast for $178 roundtrip or less with the optional free stopover in Las Vegas or Phoenix promotion is still available. Plus, we have many last-minute goodies that will be posted in the next few days that we cannot promote at this time. Be sure to keep visiting <http://www.bestfares.com> for these great specials.
