Growth!

Huifeng Biochemistry was formed in the year 2O0O with a view to become 
a cost effective producer and supp|ier of bulk Pharmaceutical and 
Neutraceutical products wor|dwide.

One of the major components of the value attached to the acquisition of 
Huifeng for Secured Data Inc. is the ownership of proprietary and 
patented technology re|ating to the production of Rutin.

Rutin is a member of biof|avonoids, a |arge grOup of phenolic secondary 
metabo|ites of plants that include more than 2,000 different known 
chemica|s. Bioflavonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their ability to strengthen and modulate the 
permeability of the walls of the blood vesse|s inc|uding capillaries.
With their unique and patented techno|ogy, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets wor|dwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary technology, strong corporate re|ations with 
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing facilities and 
access to growing markets in which to se|l its drug products.

Estimated revenues for 2OO4-20O5 are more then  $1OO mil|iOn USD

Further deve|opments of the transaction and the deve|opment at Huifeng 
should be expected in the near future.
