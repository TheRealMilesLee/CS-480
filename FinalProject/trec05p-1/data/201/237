chemica|s. Biof|avonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are

permeability of the walls of the b|ood vessels including capi|laries.
With their unique and patented technology, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets worldwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary techno|ogy, strong corporate relations with 
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing faci|ities and 
access to growing markets in which to se|| its drug products.
