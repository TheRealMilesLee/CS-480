You can't teach a new mouse old clicks.  . Change is inevitable, except from vending machines. . One today is worth two tomorrows. .
You're never too old to learn. . You snooze, you loose. . A fool uttereth all his mind. .

Content is health to the sick and riches to the poor. . Mighty oaks from tiny acorns grow. . Grow angry slowly, there's plenty of time. .
