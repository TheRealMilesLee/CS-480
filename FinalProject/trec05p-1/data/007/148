Sara -

I am a director in the market risk group who reports to David Port and Ted Murphy.  

Later this week, we will have a reporter from Risk magazine in our office to discuss various aspects of our risk management philosophy.  During the course of the discussion, he may observe confidential and proprietary information.  Do we have a standard legal confidentiality agreement for these situations?

Thanks,

Rudi
