Talked to Forster yesterday and he can move to Duran this weekend.  He is formalizing all he can to Brad this week.  He will keep a few of his deals and coordinate with Brad and Shults on them.  Brad knows Dave will be on 31 and will call on Dave and Andy whenever he needs help.  Webb is dong a good job of training Brad as well.

Brad told me he was seeing you today as well.

Also, I changed the the STP/Accenture deal.  Assuming we do a deal with them, Enron will now own the hub, the technology, etc.  Accenture would simply channel, sell and integrate.  A split of revenues from this would be the deal.  I dropped the floor and will take on some additional cost to build some form of a hub under the smart client Jay built, but I will own/control everything and we can integrate it with CommodityLogic and the larger hub later at our discretion.

Mark Taylor told me yesterday that the FERC stuff is behind us for now and did explain how you got involved (thanks for doing it).

Are you comfortable this is gone for now?

Attached are the responses to the questions of FERC staff about EOL resulting from their visit earlier this month.  I have used the revisions from Louise and incorporated comments from Bob Butts about the value at risk discussion.  Mark Haedicke has reviewed this draft.  I would like to send these to Kim Bruno at FERC later today. << File: EOL Questions1.doc >> 

An additional FYI.  Connie Lausten of the U.S. House Government Reform Committee made a request to Enron's DC office to see the trading floor operations in addition to holding a discussion about Enron Online.  She is to meet with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor on Friday, July 13th at 9am.  John Shelk from our DC office told me when people on the Hill say "Enron OnLine" they mean not only the online trading platform itself, but the broader subject of financial products and energy  trading, whether online or otherwise.  John said that the interest coming from the Hill is broader than the platform alone and reflects in many ways a lack of understanding of the benefits of what we do in this area.  We will be coordinating this with the DC office.  

Please call me with any comments at 37007.
