Hi Rick,
 
Below is the updated RCR Budget Spreadsheet with the addition of today's RCR's for  2,000.00 from Novosel/Robertson, 2,000.00 from Lawner/Kingerski and 20,000.00 from Hemstock/Hemstock.  I did not add Robert Hemstock's RCR to the spreadsheet because he does not have a defined budget set aside. Should this RCR come out of your budget in the future, please advise.  Just a reminder,  Janine's RCR was put on hold until further discussion.  You mentioned that Harry could make the call on this one, I will make sure he lets me know what the final outcome will be.
 
Thanks,
 
DB
