Dear NYISO Market Participants:

On December 11 - 13, 2001 the NYISO will present NYMOC in the Lone Star
State. We've just posted the course on our web site at

http://www.nyiso.com/services/training/cinfo/index.html

This course is similar to NYMOCs run in the Albany NY area, except that it
does not include Billing and Accounting details. The program will address
the latest system updates, however, and rigorously covers all marketplace
topics.

The course will be conducted at the Hyatt Regency Houston, 1200 Louisiana
Street, Houston, Texas, from 8:30 am  Tuesday December 11 until 3:00 pm
Thursday December 13. If you're interested, we suggest you register early
as we expect a healthy turn-out. In order to get a realistic count, there
will be a $300 charge for no-shows, or for cancellations not made by 12:00
noon Monday, December 3.

Please call Customer Relations at (518) 356-6060, if you have any questions
regarding the course, or Debbie Doyle at (518) 356-6274 regarding
registrations.
