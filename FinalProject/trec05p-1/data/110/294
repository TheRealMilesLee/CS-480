If it is same as mid-year, then I won't need to look at it.  Thanks.  Michelle

Hi Michelle-

Here's the Confidentiality Agreement we used at Mid Year for the HR staff who required access to employee records outside their own BU or access to restricted records (HR employees).

Would you like to revise this form, or shall we use the same version for this round?

Please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible. 

Thanks,
-Dovie
