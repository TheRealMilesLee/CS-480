Kevin,

Tomorrow I am meeting with 2 separate consulting groups that represent collectively 15 EMCs in Georgia.  As a result of our calling efforts, it appears as if these 15 are some of the larger EMCs under Oglethorpe.  I think these 2 groups are planning to break apart from OPC and form 2 new agencies (7 in one, 8 in the other).  I plan to get as many details on this as possible during the meetings.

There are 2 opportunities at this point with specific EMCs in each of these groups.  Both are to buy energy on the Georgia ITS.  1) 75MW, 7x24, Jan-Feb'02, and 2) 20MW, 7x24, 3-5 yrs., beginning 1/1/03, prefer load following at a 73% load factor, but will consider a block purchase.

I'm going to get more details on these separate requests, but wanted your initial interest level.

Thanks,

Billy Braddock
