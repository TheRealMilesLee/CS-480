I just remembered something funny that happened on the bus this morning.
Remember the guy who I told you about, the one who gets excited when I get
on the bus.  Anyways, this morning he was staring at me as usual, and
instead of looking away, I smiled at him.  So when he got up to get off, he
asks me if I like cinnamon rolls.  I said no. And he said I will bring you
some tomorrow and then I said awesome.  Now, I have to take the earlier bus
so I won't have to see him.  This girl who I am friends with was sitting
next to me during the interaction and it was pretty funny.
ok, that is it.

Let's see...I worked a little on Sunday, but wasn't too motivated
because of all of the turmoil at the company.  Weather was really nice,
so Mark and I went to a bar that's half outside to watch some football.
Only thing is, the one game we wanted to watch, wasn't on.  At least
there was plenty of beer.  Then we went home and grilled some steaks.  I
like steak.  That's about it.  How about you?  Did you get all of your
laundry done.  I didn't.

Mat
