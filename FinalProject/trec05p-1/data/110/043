Good Afternoon Team,

Belo issued its statistical report for the month of September.  Newspaper Group total revenues were down 10% in September on a pro forma basis. September 2001 had one more Sunday than September 2000.  Excluding the effect of the extra Sunday this year, Newspaper Group revenues were down approximately 16% . The Newspaper Group's revenue loss specifically related to the attacks was about $2 million.  At The Dallas Morning News, total full-run advertising linage, including preprints and supplements, was down 10.9% versus 2000.  Classified volumes were down 12.8%  with continued weakness in classified employment.   At The Providence Journal, total full-run advertising linage, including preprints and supplements, decreased 8.3 %.   Retail and classified volumes decreased 9.5% and 7.3 %, respectively.   The decrease in ad linage has decreased ad revenues to Belo -- which has negatively impacted Belo's total revenues.  Many publishers also find themselves in this weak position... and producers are struggling amidst sluggish newsprint demand.

Ayesha
