yea i didn't think so.  I figure I will seize the opportunity before our
little one arrives.  The weekend that it is playing there doesn't work out
for us, otherwise we would have done it then.

Ed and I are getting tickets to Tuna Christmas and wanted to know if any
of
you were interested in going with us.  Here is the scoop:

Date:	Thursday Dec. 13th 8pm

Where:  Galveston, The Opera House.   I know it won't be a fun drive
home
but the show is not coming to Houston this year.

Ticket Price: $36 or less.  We are getting the 36 tickets as I want good
seats on the first level.  However, we may not all be able to sit
together.

I thought it would be fun to leave Houston a little early on Thursday,
say
by 430ish and drive to Galveston for dinner somewhere and then go to the
play.

Let me know if you are interested in going, I plan on getting our
tickets by
tomorrow.

Jennifer
