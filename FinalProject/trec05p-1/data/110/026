Richard:
 
I understand from Elliot that we want to keep the spreadsheet of EES positions separate from our Fundies site. 
I started a file at O:\Portland\WestDesk\RenewablePowerDesk\Shared\Internal intelligence\EES Position based on the info. you provided to Jesse in an e-mail dated 10/8.
The spreadsheet is attached.
 
*Will this spreadsheet meet our needs?
*Is the location suitable?  
    -How limited should access to this be?  
*What is the most efficient mechanism by which to update this information - i.e., will you update it directly, or coordinate with me?
 
Thanks, 
 
Jenny
