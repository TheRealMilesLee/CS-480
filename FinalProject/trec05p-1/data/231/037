Hi Audrey,

Sorry I missed your phone call the other day.  It is actually a 14 hour 
time difference and we didn't get to the phone before it went to voice 
mail and we didn't see the message light until the next morning. Sorry 
about that.

I am fine coming home from Dallas at the same time as Steve on Wed 
morning.  If Mark would prefer me to stay and meet with the Aquila 
folks with him on Wed morning, I'm happy to do that too.  Whatever he 
prefers. 

We are having a great time.  Hong Kong is wonderful.  We are eating way 
too much.  We are off to the New Territories today.

Hope all is well.  The big E is on the top news on the international 
CNN channel.  

Have a great day.  Thanks for all of your help!  Kim.
