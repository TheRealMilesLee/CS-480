FROM NICHOLAS .F. NNAMANI, 
BRANCH MANAGER 
NIGERIA NATIONAL PETROLUEM CO-OPERATION 
TELEPHONE: 234-8037291612.

Kindly reply: nicholaax@yahoo.com

Dear Friend,

It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my colleagues. I have decided to seek a 
confidential co-operation with you in the execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of the business. Within the Department of NIGERIA NATIONAL PETROLUEM CO-OPERATION where I work as an Assistant Director of audit, with the co-operation of two other top officials, we have in our possession an overdue contractor payment in US Dollars funds.

The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm,(Pearls Ltd) which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$25,500,000 (twenty five  Million five Hundred Thousand US Dollars).Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good relations with foreign governments and non-governmental agencies, we included our bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank (central bank of Nigeria ) (cbn).We are 100% sure of funds approvals to anyone or company we (The Audit Committee) recommend as part of the sub-contractors who did jobs for the Department. 

We are seeking your assistance to front as the sub-contractor of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts. Details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment and approvals will be secured on behalf of you/your Company.

My colleagues and I are prepared to give you 20% while we take 70% and the balance of 10% for taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred. This business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. It does not matter whether you/your Company does contract projects, as a transfer of rights will be secured in favor of you/your Company through the Federal High Court of Nigeria  before we can proceed. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us. Kindly notify me immediately via my alternative email (nicholaax@yahoo.com ) for further details upon your acceptance of this proposal.

Yours Faithfully,

PRINCE  NICHOLAS .F. NNAMANI.
