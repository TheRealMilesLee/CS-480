What do you think about this? The first attachment is what you and I discussed Vasco.  The second is what SBA originally proposed.  Keep in mind that SBA has offered a 30% reduction on the original fees if another LDC retains him, but as you said, even those reduced fees seemed high to one of the LDC's who reviewed them, so we may not get the reduction.  I don't want to rely on that.
