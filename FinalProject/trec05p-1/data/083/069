Heather - the original of the Action of General Partner for the captioned LP was inadvertently sent to you yesterday by Jeff instead of being sent here to the minute book - I know he had a temp assisting him so that's probably where the hiccup occurred.  Would you please take your copy of the original and return the original to me.  Many thanks.  Best regards Kate
