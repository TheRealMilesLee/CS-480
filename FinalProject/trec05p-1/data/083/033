I knew I loved you for some reason....hee...hee.   I know that God is at work in both of our lives....I thank God for you.  Just as God gave us a "release" from our work at VM, should He decide to "send" us back, we will do just that--come back.  For now, we are in transition.  God is growing us all up for His purpose.  We both know of families (brothers, sisters, parents) that have been separated because of some crisis or another....broken homes, right?  Many times in this type of situation, God has brought the "members" of those families back together for the betterment of all because they "chose" to grow in His will; then, sometimes in His infinite wisdom, He sees fit to allow the separation to continue because reuniting the family would mean the destruction of all, because of the rebellion of at least one--because he/she/they made the "choice" to remain how he/she/they were originally--You ! know that God searches our hearts and He knows all truth.  None of us will ever be perfect while we are on earth, but our "choice" is to strive to be in God's perfect will.  Continue to seek God's face.  Stay in your Word!  Sometimes God will "send in order to mend!"  Just like the sacrificial Lamb called Jesus was sent in order to heal the sins of this world--this mended our relationship with God, restored us to fellowship with Him.  All God things are good things, even if they hurt us a little!  REMEMBER: The Lord is our Helper, we do not fear what man may do us.
