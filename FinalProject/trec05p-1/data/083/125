Attention: Portland & Calgary-based Outlook Users

The Global Messaging Team is proud to announce that Portland &
Calgary-based Enron employees that have been migrated to Outlook will now
be able to securely access their Enron Email from anywhere on the web. This
means that if you can get on to the Internet, you can access your Enron
Email with Outlook Web Access (OWA) without having to dial in to Enron's
network. Please note that this is not available to those users still on
Lotus Notes but will be available once they are migrated to Outlook.


Once on the Internet, type mail.enron.com in your browser address window
and supply your Enron network logon credentials as username and password.
For example:


  Username: jdoe4


  Password: ********


Once you log in, Outlook Web Access opens your Enron Email mailbox. Outlook
Web Access (OWA) allows you to send and receive mail, perform calendar
tasks and manage your mail and contacts, as well as access your mailbox
folders. At this time, Public Folders are not accessible via OWA.  Please
keep in mind that Outlook Web Access is a browser-based version of what you
might use in the office, so the functionality may be slightly different and
some features of Outlook 2000 may not be available at all. Additionally,
OWA is only supported using Internet Explorer 5.x only and not supported
with Netscape.


Outlook Web Access is the standard Email package for connecting to your
Enron mail from home, whether you are using an Enron-issued home PC, an
Internet connection with your personal home PC, or your ClickAtHome PC. We
will not support the use of the full Outlook installation for home use.


Outlook Web Access for some remote locations and European/APAC Enron sites
is currently being addressed and will be available soon. At this time, OWA
is only available if your mailbox resides on a Houston, Portland or Calgary
mail server.


If you have any questions, please contact your local IT support.
