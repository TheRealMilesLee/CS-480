Hi richard,
can you find out or have michele find out as much as we can about obtaining FTRs and the various issues regarding that... with regards to.. time lines and logistics and our rights as LSEs.
It is becoming more and more apparent that we could save a lot of money by physically serving the load that we have in PJM if we get FTRs allocated to us. As a part of the new auction that the Jersey utilities are having we might be able to get some things done that might not have been possible as an LSE ... like getting FTRs from locations that we choose and such...
I would like to see if we can start puting pressure on them next week...if we can get our information gathering done this week then we will be in shape to meet with our govt affairs people maybe next week.. if we have to.
Also as a side note... any information on how we can request capacity for the transmission that we requested 15 to 20 days ago for 2004???

thanks.
