Here is the revised Term Sheet we sent to Cogentrix:

 
I'll be chatting with Tom Bonner at Cogentrix later today to see if they have any comments on this or the other documents we sent them.  Apologies for the confusion in this process and thanks for bearing with me as I go through this the first time around :->)

Hi Rahil,

Kortney left me a message indicating that she has not reviewed (and therefore not approved) the documents re Cogentrix.  We will see what happens.  

Have you forwarded the term sheet you sent to Cogentrix to Kortney?  I would like a copy as well, and I can't find the version which was sent to Cogentrix.  The version I have has the incorrect customer name at the top.

Thanks,

Kay
