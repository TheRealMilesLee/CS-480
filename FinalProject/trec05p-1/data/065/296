Sara and Marie,
How is Monument coming along?  They use Credit Lyonnais as their back office.
We will use MSDW and GSI for Futures and Options.
We will use Carr  [Glover, Sheila]  and Deutche  for Futures.

I had given you a contact of Jackie Tokley, 207-3385740.
Thanks, 
Sheila

We are expanding our trading in the European Market.  

We will be forwarding to legal the documentation related to these two new Executing Brokers which will be utilized for order flow and research.

I will send to legal the required documentation and legal contacts.
