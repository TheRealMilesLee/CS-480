Hi Ms. Causholli,

I have made recently a major multiclient study "Outlook for World Tissue 
Business" which includes all tissue mills with capacities worldwide plus 
capacity profiles by the largest producers worldwide and by region. I attach the 
study proposal with this e-mail. The report costs US$ 3,500 (300 pages with 
detailed Annexes).

If you would like to have only capacity data for the regions you mentioned plus 
the top 10-12 global producers, I could sell this part of information at US$ 
600. You should specify the form in which I should present it so that I 
could easier fulfil your data needs.


Best regards
