Hey folks,

In preparation for Monday's call, I've put together a set of job descriptions for the members of our group. I look forward to your input and feedback as we sort out our division of labor. October is going to be a month to remember. By the end of the month, we should have product offerings, new curves, a fundamentals site, and hopefully a few new transactions under our belt. Talk to you on Monday.

EM
