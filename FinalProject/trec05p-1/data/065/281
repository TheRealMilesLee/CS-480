Woody,

I haven't gotten an answer yet from HQ whether they will do a CFD instead of
physical delivery.  We are running out of time for Monday so for next week
GMP is taking physical delivery at Chateaugay and Morgan Stanley is doing a
"wheel through" New York and delivering the energy to NEPOOL.  HQ is on
board with that.

Next week we should have an answer from HQ about a CFD. Can we can talk next
week about a deal going forward.  GMP's contract with HQ continues until
Oct. 31, 2015.

Hi Anabeth - Ben and I were wondering about the results of your call to
HQ regarding a possible financial deal at this point

also - do you any kind of indicative offer so we see if we are even
close

we would have to work up a specific confirm for this deal but that is
fairly easily doable

pls reply to both of us

thanks

Woody and Ben
