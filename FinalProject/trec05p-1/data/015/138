RE:  Use the Funds for Less priveledge..

I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Dr. Harry Jones who worked with Kuwait Embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he diedin the year 2000.We were married for eleven years without a child.
He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again christians. 

Since his  death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home .
When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of 

$8.6Million (Eight Million six hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with a finance/security company in Europe.
Presently, this money is still with the Security Company and the management has written me as the beneficiary to come forward to receive the trunk box of money or rather issue a letter of authorisation to somebody to receive it on my behalf if I can not come over.
Presently, I'm in a hospital where I have been undergoing 

treatment for oesophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I might not be able to survive this illness from all indications.

It is my last wish to see this money distributed to victims of Hiv/aids,charities donations,Orphans and other needy persons in your country.
Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this 

huge responsibility to any of them anymore.
I beg you in the name of God to help me collect the deposit and the interest accrued from the company and distribute it accordingly.
I want a person that is God fearing that will use this money to assist and utilise for orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.
I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not beleivers and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a  situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner.
Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in 
the bosom of the Lord.
Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not be able to use the telephone communication in this regard because of my soundless voice and the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development.
With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Finance/ Security Company. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the new beneficiary of this fund. I want you and your fellow believers to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard.
My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. 

however that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for another person for this same purpose.
Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated  herein.
Hoping to hearing from you soon.

Mrs Mary Jones.
