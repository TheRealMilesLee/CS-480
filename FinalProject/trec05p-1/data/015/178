Michelle, Per your request, I've been thinking hw to represent the issues and opportunities - Please take a look at the attached.  It represents HR Risk mgmt with three distinct influence areas:

1.   HR Audit / QC 
2.   EEO/AAP/Diversity
3.   Employee Relations 

The HR Risk Mgmt.is under current structure accountable to your "non-legal oversight.  As you have indicated, as a practical matter the functions will always need and be collaborative with the legal interface with offices of HR Leadership.  As contemplated, the alignment I've represented is reassignable without impacting the three influence arenas, should they prove successful.  More important, a future reasignment shouldn't impact users or customers of HR Risk Mgmt.  I'll look forward to your comments and an opportunity to review this with you.
