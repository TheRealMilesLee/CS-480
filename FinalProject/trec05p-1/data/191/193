Kam - attached is the sitara book request form.  Sitara books go to the global common code group and global counterparty group.  Basically, our group was the go between among these groups.  Hope this helps.

Susan,

Can I please get a copy of the physical  Portfolio Request form from you so in the future we get these physical books set up correctly.
Could you also tell me what needs to be done differently from all other books.  

We created our own Data Codes and sent them to global counterparties, is there anything else different?

KK

also, can you tell me when the PERFORMANCE book will be ready.  Ed McMicheal needs to value those deals today.


Thanks
