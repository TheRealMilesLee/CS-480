Jeanie,  What I see is a deduction for United Way in the amount of 1500.00 and a deduction for Parking in the amount of 37.00.  Please let me know if he has additional questions.

On Scott's last paycheck-Dec.31.  there was a deduction labeled "other deductions" for 1537.  Is there anyway we can determine what exactly that was for?  Thanks much.
