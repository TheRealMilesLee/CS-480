REQUEST FOR URGENT TRANSFER

In my quest for a reliable and trusted partner for a highly important and lucrative venture cum investment, I came across your contact as a reliable
partner for this venture. I am Mr. Alfred Dube, one of the senior Accountants of AMALGAMATED BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA (ABSA). 
To highlight you on this proposal, there is an account opened in this bank since 1980 till 1990 after which, nobody has operated on this account again
till date. After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it would be forfeited for nothing. 
The owner of this account is Mr. Ben Andreas, a foreigner, and a miner at Kruger gold co., a geologist by profession who died since 1990. No other person
knows about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation further proved to me that his company does not
know anything about this account and the amount involved as he made it his personal account. 
The money outstanding before his death was (USD 26 Million) Twenty Six Million United States Dollars. I am now contacting you as a foreigner because this
money cannot be approved to a national with a local bank account here. But can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in US dollars and
the former owner, a foreigner.

I implore you to act as foreigner and beneficiary to the fund as I will then intimate you on the processes abound as well as procure all the necessary
documents required to lay claim to the money. If you are capable and willing to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions
and advice for our mutual benefit I shall highly appreciate.

I need trusted person in this business because I do not want to make mistakes;I need your strong assurance and trust. With my position now in the office I
can effect transfer of this money to any foreigner's reliable account, which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending my
arrival in your country for disbursement.

On the alternative, you can come down here to South Africa for us to meet one to one after which I will effect the remittance in your presence and two of us
will then proceed to your country, at least two days ahead of the money prior to it's reflect into the account as provided by you.
Send me your private telephone and fax numbers upon receipt of this proposal, if you genuinely want to assist and be a co-partner. I will also want us to
meet face to face, to enable us sign a binding agreement. As soon as you receive this money into a foreign account or any account of your choice where
the fund will be safe. I will proceed to your country for onward percentage distributions and investment.
I need your full co-operation to make this work because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner, who has correct information of this
account, which I will give to you later immediately. I will use my position and influence to effect legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your
account with appropriate clearance forms of the ministries and foreign exchange departments. At the conclusion of this business, for your assistance, 25% of
the total amount will be accrue for you, 70% for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of the transfer. 
I implore you to maintain the absolute confidentiality of this transaction. 

Your earliest response is urgently awaited. 

Truly Yours,

Mr. Alfred Dube
