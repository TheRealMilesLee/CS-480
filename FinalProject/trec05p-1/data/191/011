Talked to Chris McComb yesterday assuming Chet was a no way deal. Sniffed 
out what Chris has in mind and politely told him that I concerns about it 
and he needed to go talk to his dad and bro about what they wanted to do. 
Chris proposed that his individual design company buy the spot for business 
use and maybe his friends could shoot a buck under it too and pay him a 
little back. May work I said, but opening weekend would need to be members 
only, he suggested that his friends could alternate coming on opening 
weekend: which I interpreted as Chris fencing spot 8a and 8b for his friends 
Toby and Bobby to pay 1k a piece. I told him that was likely unacceptable, 
to discuss with family and get back to me...

I then called chet to beg one last time and he was receptive. BMC looks to 
be doing better he says. He was going to talk to Molly about it and would 
like to look at how co. does over the next quarter.
Please call and encourage him to commit.

Thanks ,e.
