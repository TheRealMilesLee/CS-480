Kam,
The book-id itself can be any name as long it is a unique name. The -PRC or -IDX suffixes were added as a convinience so that the risk type can be identified by looking at the book-id. The book-type or risk-type code against the book-id in RisktRAC will define the risk type and the system does not depend on the name of the book-id to identify the risk type.

Regards,
Ramesh

Andrew,

I have one question about this form.  Does the book id mean the name exactly as it appears in tagg or is it the risktrac name (attaching the risk type to the end), 
ex. FB-FINANCIAL-PRC

Thanks
