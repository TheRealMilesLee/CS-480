Dear Sir/madam,
I am soliciting your confidence in this business; this is because of  its 
nature as being utterly confidential and top secret. Though, I know  that a 
business of this sort will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am 
assuring you that this transaction is safe.

I am Mr. Richard Kpokrikpo , a Credit Officer with Inland Bank of  Nigeria. 
For the cause of this
transaction, I am working in collaboration with my bank manager, regarding 
the large deposit of a
national of your country Mr. Ailing Lori who was a ship Merchant and 
maintained a bogus account with my bank here. My cordial relationship with 
him afforded me to be the account supervisor.
I came to know you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person 
to handle this confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of his 
abandoned huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum 
confidence.

I have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.Ever 
since Mr. Ailing Lori traveled, he has not made any contact with me, the 
attorney or
any body that we know since April  2001. Valuable efforts have been made by 
the attorney
to get in touch with him or relatives but to no success. The assumption that 
Mr. Ailing must have been dead is confirmed by the attorney on his inability 
to follow up all pressing transactions then, which all of them have been 
terminated.

I have contacted you or any person you know that is capable to work with me 
as a next of kin irrespective of same surname or not. This is in the light 
of a government financial regulation order, to freeze any account containing 
huge sums of money that has been dormant for a less than the period of time 
we are talking about. The bank has made arrangement for the fund to be 
declared unclaimed and subsequently be donated to the government trust 
fund.To forestall a
total loss, the  attorney has agreed with me to put the modalities I am 
proposing to you now in place, to manage the fund and bring it to safe point 
until we are able to trace or
decide further what to do.

I now seek your permission to have you stand as the next of kin so that the 
fund $8.2M (Eight Million point two US Dollars) will be released and paid 
into your account as the beneficiary's next of kin. All documents and proves 
to enable get this fund will be carefully worked out.

I found it more convenient to commence on the transaction since I have all 
information to influence
all procedures to this effect both from the bank and from the attorney's 
assistance. We are assuring you that your Involvement in this business is 
100% risk free. Moreover this arrangement will be possible under the 
mandatory power of probate claims to be issued by the attorney, who is 
standing by us in this transaction to see what we can keep out of the lot 
that would have been
confiscated and wasted by the government.

You shall retain a percentage that would be agreed between us while the rest 
will be in our care for
investment purposes.As soon as I receive an acknowledgement of receipt of 
this message in acceptance of our mutual business proposal, I would furnish 
you with the necessary modalities and
disbursement ratio to suit both parties without any conflict including every 
other detail you may wish to know.

If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of the 
trust we have bestowed in you. Please endeavor to send your telephone and 
fax numbers so that i can reach you. On receiving your responses shall 
forward other details on what to do, to finalize all arrangements for a 
hitch free transaction. Personal email : mrrichard134@latinmail.com OR 
richard54@k.ro
Regards,
Mr. Richard Kpokrikpo
