In order to remain consistent with Enron's new security access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston, all Body Shop Members and Guests will be required to present their Enron Photo Badge ID or a Photo Driver's License to the Body Shop Security Officer each time they enter the Body Shop.  We appreciate your assistant to expedite these procedures by being prepared to present your ID to the Body Shop Security Officer each time you enter the Body Shop.  All members will continue to use their Enron ID Badges to access the exterior Body Shop building security card reader as well as use their Badge ID's at the Body Shop Front Desk Member card reader.
