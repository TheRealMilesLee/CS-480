Jim - I am not sure what Robert is referring to here (below).  Could you please advise on how to respond.  It sounds like Robert is catching up from Aleck's departure.

Thanks,
Bryan

Bryan, I understand Aleck use to submit Monthly IRTF's for he and I but we have not done them for a number of months now.  Given Aleck's departure, I am trying to figure out what reports I must do each month.  Is this report in place of the Monthly IRTF's?

Robert - Please send me your monthly EES/ENA update for October.  I have attached your report for September, so it should be easy to just modify what you have there, or add any new activities you may be involved in.  Your report is part of a larger report that Jim Steffes reviews at the beginning of every month.

Thank you for your help,
If you have any questions, please call me at 713-345-2430.

Bryan
