I'm all tied up trying to get a presentation together today - perhaps we should try next Wednesday.  I know Neeti is very interested in getting to know you ladies and I always love a visit.  Let's shoot for next Wednesday.

Our department has scheduled an offsite this afternoo and I will not be able to make lunch.  Please let me know if you reschedule and count me in.  Thanks.
