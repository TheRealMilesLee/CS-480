As you read this=2C I don't want you to feel sorry for me=2C
because I believe everyone will die someday=2E My name is Mr=2E
Abdul nasser Naji=2Ca merchant Dubai in the UAE=2E I have been
diagnosed with Esophageal Cancer which was discovered very
late=2Cdue to my laxity in caring for my health=2E It has
defiled all forms of medicine=2C and right now I have only
about a few months to live=2C according to medical experts=2E I
have not particularly lived my life so well=2C as I never
really cared for anyone not even myself but my business=2E
Though I am very rich=2C I was never generous=2C I was always
hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was
the only thing I cared for=2E But now I regret all this as I
now know that there is more to life than just wanting to
have or make all the money in the world=2E I believe when God
gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live
my life a different way from how I have lived it=2E Now that
God ! has called me=2C I have willed and given most of my
properties and assets to my immediate and extended family
members and as well as a few close friends=2E I want God to
be merciful to me and accept my soul and so=2C I have decided
to give alms to charity organizations and give succour and
comfort to the less priviledged in our societies=2C as I want
this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth=2E

So far=2C I have distributed money to some charity
organizations in the U=2EA=2EE=2C Algeria and Malaysia=2E Now that
my health has deteriorated so badly=2C I cannot do this my
self anymore=2E I once asked members of my family to close
one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have
there to charity organization and to the less priviledged
in Bulgaria and Pakistan=2C they refused and kept the money
to themselves=2E Hence=2C I do not trust them anymore=2C as they
seem not to be contended with what I have left for them=2E

The last of my money which no one knows of=2C is the huge
cash deposit of twenty four million dollars=28$24=2C000 000=2EOO=29
that I have with a Security Company outfit in Europe for
safe keeping=2E I want you to help me collect this deposit
and disburse it to some charity organizations=2C the less
priviledged and victims of natural disaster=2E

Please send me a mail to indicate if you will assist me in
this disbursement=2EI have set aside 30% for you for your
time and patience=2E

You can e-mail me at=3A najiabdul777=40netscape=2Enet
while I await
to hear from you=2C may God be with you and your entire
family=2E

Remain blessed=2E
Mr=2E Abdul Nasser Naji
