It's been brought to my attention that we never resolved the issue of the
common scheduling time (no Freudian slip on the acronym).  The group agreed
to a PST value in July, but we wanted to survey the OC and WMIC first before
going further.  That was to be one of our topic in Vancouver.  Well....

So, I'd like to get a feel from the group: the survey leaned toward Pacific
Prevailing Time as that match up with energy products, so.. continue to go
forward with PST as in July, modify our suggestion to PPT or drop all
together and wait to see if NERC is going to come up with something.  If we
decide to go with either PST or PPT, I will get the OC Steering to help with
clarification on this as a due process item or an item that can be brought
to the OC for vote in 2002.  In addition, I would think that most would
agree that implementation if it takes affect would be favorable at the April
2002 time change, so that is my suggestion that we use, if ISAS goes forward
with the request to the OC.

Please get back with your thought by next Wednesday so I can put together
something for the upcoming OC meetings.
