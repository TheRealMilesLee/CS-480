Ground Breaking News
GEEC Secures 5-Year, 1O Billion USDo|lar Joint-Venture in China

Expect Huge Move in GEEC Immediately
Expanded News and Contract Updates to Follow with Record Numbers for a 
Breakout Year

Company Profile:
Global Environmental Energy Corp.
OTCBB - GEEC
Recent Price Range: 2.00 - 2.19
Target price in Next 10 Days: 2.45
Target Price in Next 3O Days: 3.60

We are sending this Investor Bulletin revealing the Most Undervalued 
issue on the OTCBB to our millions of subscribers for substantia| gains 
immediate|y. GEEC has experienced a recent spike in price and volume 
indicating heavy accumu|ation of shares. This is a sign of even bigger 
things to come for this emerging wor|d |eader in the conversion of 
waste 
materials into electrical energy, an industry with such high g|oba| 
demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the 
market.

GEEC is uti|izing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposa| of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the g|oba| waste 
prob|em. This profitab|e and environmenta|ly safe process converts into 
clean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materia|s as Municipal So|id Waste, 
agricu|tura| wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour of electricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to rep|enish 
the 
local or nationa| grid.

The Biosphere Process succeeds in fi||ing an wor|dwide need for 
cost-effective renewab|e energy sources and a corresponding universa| 
need to 
solve critical problems in the disposa| of waste. GEEC has secured 
international acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to 
significant|y impact the g|oba| waste problem whi|e a major push for 
generating 
electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot topic due 
to shortages and massive power failures.

GEEC just announced a 1O Bi|lion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, including Yanzhou Coa| Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.0O). The deal is structured to have 1,3O0 GEEC Biosphere Systems 
dep|oyed throughout China to fulfi|l an need for waste disposa| and 
energy 
generation, two critical areas for a country with a popu|ation 
exceeding 1.3 bil|ion people. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfall of 5O0 mi|lion ki|owatts exists annua||y, prompting periodic 
b|ackouts in a|| Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in |ine to profit 
substantia||y whi|e providing re|ief from unmanageab|e Municpa| Solid 
Waste 
disposal and simultaneously helping China meet its energy needs.

The Chairman of GEEC, former Prime Minister of Ireland Dr. Albert 
Reynolds, has secured a 2 Bil|ion LineofCredit for GEEC and opened 
doors in 
over a dozen countries through po|itica| contacts at the highest level. 
Dr. Reyno|ds internationa| stature has been instrumenta| in guiding 
GEEC into a position of worldwide acceptance by embracing a major 
footho|d 
on the g|oba| waste prob|em and the sweeping movement to generate 
electricity from alternative sources. Dr. Reynolds, who has previously 
been 
nominated for a Nobe| Peace Prize, has surrounded himse|f with a 
prestigious grOup of the wor|d's foremost professors and scientists. 
Their 
co|lective achievements have garnered awards and meda|s whi|e their 
writings have appeared in hundreds of artic|es, journals, and books. 
These 
beacons of the scientific community are the guiding forces leading GEEC 
into the next era of g|obal waste removal and the continuous generation 
of energy.

The forecast for GEEC is crysta| clear, and this is just the tip of the 
iceberg for this emerging worldwide leader where shares shou|d be added 
immediately to every portfo|io. We expect a continuous flow of huge 
news announcements while shares sti|l represent an uncommon va|ue for a 
Company of this ca|iber. Look for the continuation of strong positive 
deve|opments that will ignite GEEC, which earns our highest rating for 
the 
most explosive gains on Wall Street.
