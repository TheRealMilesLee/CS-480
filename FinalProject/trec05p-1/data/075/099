Mr. Taylor,
We spoke briefly last week regarding manufacturers ZEV credit status,
verification of manufacturers credit totals with the ARB, and ZEV credit
trading.  I wanted to let you know I'm still looking into your request
and will provide the information as soon as possible.  Unfortunately,
this is taking more time than I originally anticipated and wanted to let
you know the status of your request.
