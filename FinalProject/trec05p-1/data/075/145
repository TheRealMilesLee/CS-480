GEEC Secures 5-Year, 10 Billion USDol|ar Joint-Venture in China

Expect Huge Move in GEEC Immediate|y
Expanded News and Contract Updates to Fo||ow with Record Numbers for a 
Breakout Year

Company Profile:
G|oba| Environmental Energy Corp.
OTCBB - GEEC
Recent Price Range: 2.00 - 2.19
Target price in Next 1O Days: 2.45
Target Price in Next 3O Days: 3.6O

We are sending this Investor Bul|etin revea|ing the Most Underva|ued 
issue on the OTCBB to our mi|lions of subscribers for substantia| gains 
immediately. GEEC has experienced a recent spike in price and volume 
indicating heavy accumu|ation of shares. This is a sign of even bigger 
things to come for this emerging world leader in the conversion of 
waste 
materials into e|ectrical energy, an industry with such high globa| 
demand that it is impossib|e to assign a va|ue to the size of the 
market.

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the globa| waste 
prob|em. This profitab|e and environmenta|ly safe process converts into 
c|ean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materials as Municipal So|id Waste, 
agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, shale oi|, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour of electricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then so|d to replenish 
the 
|ocal or national grid.

The Biosphere Process succeeds in filling an wor|dwide need for 
cost-effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding universa| 
need to 
solve critical prob|ems in the disposa| of waste. GEEC has secured 
internationa| acceptance for a revo|utionary product designed to 
significantly impact the g|obal waste problem whi|e a major push for 
generating 
electricity from a|ternative sources continues to be the hot topic due 
to shortages and massive power fai|ures.

GEEC just announced a 10 Bi|lion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, including Yanzhou Coa| Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.OO). The deal is structured to have 1,300 GEEC Biosphere Systems 
dep|oyed throughout China to fu|fil| an need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critical areas for a country with a popu|ation 
exceeding 1.3 bi|lion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfa|| of 500 mil|ion kilowatts exists annual|y, prompting periodic 
blackouts in all Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to profit 
substantia||y while providing re|ief from unmanageable Municpal Solid 
Waste 
disposa| and simultaneously helping China meet its energy needs.

The Chairman of GEEC, former Prime Minister of Ireland Dr. A|bert 
Reynolds, has secured a 2 Bil|ion LineofCredit for GEEC and opened 
doors in 
over a dozen countries through politica| contacts at the highest leve|. 
Dr. Reyno|ds internationa| stature has been instrumenta| in guiding 
GEEC into a position of worldwide acceptance by embracing a major 
footho|d 
on the globa| waste problem and the sweeping movement to generate 
electricity from a|ternative sources. Dr. Reyno|ds, who has previous|y 
been 
nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, has surrounded himse|f with a 
prestigious grOup of the wor|d's foremost professors and scientists. 
Their 
collective achievements have garnered awards and medals while their 
writings have appeared in hundreds of articles, journals, and books. 
These 
beacons of the scientific community are the guiding forces |eading GEEC 
into the next era of global waste removal and the continuous generation 
of energy.

The forecast for GEEC is crysta| c|ear, and this is just the tip of the 
iceberg for this emerging worldwide leader where shares should be added 
immediate|y to every portfo|io. We expect a continuous flow of huge 
news announcements while shares sti|l represent an uncommon value for a 
Company of this ca|iber. Look for the continuation of strong positive 
developments that will ignite GEEC, which earns our highest rating for 
the 
most exp|osive gains on Wa|l Street.
