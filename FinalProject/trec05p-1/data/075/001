Thanks. I scheduled a meeting for tomorrow at 9:30 AM. I've attached a copy of the Doyle DASH which I would like you to sign tomorrow (we expect to have Haedicke's signature by then).

Hope the couple sentences I sent you last night on Onondaga and Doyle were sufficient for the board meeting today.

Regards,

Ben

Louise:

I'd like to get on your calendar in the next couple of days to discuss a couple of items. Are you OK with me scheduling something with Tammy? I'll only need 45 minutes or so. 

Thanks,

Ben
