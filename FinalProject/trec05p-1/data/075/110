I think this sounds like a very good plan.

Elliot:
 
Let me know if you would like help planning an off-site.  I think the key thing is that we are all away from our offices.  If we did want to do Colorado, I just priced the following roundtrip tickets for a departure on Wednesday, Nov. 7, returning Friday, Nov. 9 (assuming a meeting all day Thursday and 1/2 day Friday) to get a sense of cost: 
 
IAH-DEN: $318 (Continental)
PDX-DEN: $217 (Frontier)
