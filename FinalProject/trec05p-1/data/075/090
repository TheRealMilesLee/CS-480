Cindy and Kathy --

The United Way Board meeting went great this morning.  The Board was
enthusiastic about the One Houston United Campaign! I think they felt the
plan was well thought out and could generate excitement as well as
contributions within the community!  They liked the idea of any funds over
$4 million going to a United Way One Houston United Restricted Fund for
future emergencies like Allison.  They voted to have the entire United Way
Board as the volunteer committee too.

Thanks so much for all you are doing on this -- your leadership is making
things happen in a BIG way!  

More later!
Anne
