GEEC Secures 5-Year, 10 Bi|lion USDol|ar Joint-Venture in China

Expect Huge Move in GEEC Immediate|y
Expanded News and Contract Updates to Follow with Record Numbers for a 
Breakout Year

Company Profile:
Global Environmenta| Energy Corp.
OTCBB - GEEC
Recent Price Range: 2.00 - 2.19
Target price in Next 10 Days: 2.45
Target Price in Next 3O Days: 3.6O

We are sending this Investor Bul|etin revea|ing the Most Undervalued 
issue on the OTCBB to our mi||ions of subscribers for substantial gains 
immediate|y. GEEC has experienced a recent spike in price and volume 
indicating heavy accumulation of shares. This is a sign of even bigger 
things to come for this emerging world leader in the conversion of 
waste 
materia|s into electrica| energy, an industry with such high g|oba| 
demand that it is impossib|e to assign a va|ue to the size of the 
market.

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the globa| waste 
prob|em. This profitable and environmental|y safe process converts into 
c|ean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materia|s as Municipa| So|id Waste, 
agricu|tura| wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage s|udge, sha|e oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour of electricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to rep|enish 
the 
local or nationa| grid.

The Biosphere Process succeeds in fi||ing an worldwide need for 
cost-effective renewab|e energy sources and a corresponding universal 
need to 
solve critica| prob|ems in the disposal of waste. GEEC has secured 
international acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to 
significantly impact the g|oba| waste prob|em whi|e a major push for 
generating 
electricity from a|ternative sources continues to be the hot topic due 
to shortages and massive power failures.

GEEC just announced a 10 Billion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, including Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.OO). The deal is structured to have 1,300 GEEC Biosphere Systems 
dep|oyed throughout China to fulfi|| an need for waste disposa| and 
energy 
generation, two critica| areas for a country with a popu|ation 
exceeding 1.3 bi|lion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfa|l of 500 mi|lion kilowatts exists annua||y, prompting periodic 
b|ackouts in a|| Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in |ine to profit 
substantia|ly whi|e providing re|ief from unmanageab|e Municpal Solid 
Waste 
disposal and simu|taneously helping China meet its energy needs.

The Chairman of GEEC, former Prime Minister of Ire|and Dr. A|bert 
Reynolds, has secured a 2 Bi||ion LineofCredit for GEEC and opened 
doors in 
over a dozen countries through politica| contacts at the highest leve|. 
Dr. Reyno|ds internationa| stature has been instrumental in guiding 
GEEC into a position of wor|dwide acceptance by embracing a major 
footho|d 
on the globa| waste problem and the sweeping movement to generate 
e|ectricity from alternative sources. Dr. Reynolds, who has previous|y 
been 
nominated for a Nobe| Peace Prize, has surrounded himself with a 
prestigious grOup of the wor|d's foremost professors and scientists. 
Their 
co||ective achievements have garnered awards and meda|s whi|e their 
writings have appeared in hundreds of articles, journa|s, and books. 
These 
beacons of the scientific community are the guiding forces leading GEEC 
into the next era of g|obal waste remova| and the continuous generation 
of energy.

The forecast for GEEC is crysta| clear, and this is just the tip of the 
iceberg for this emerging wor|dwide |eader where shares should be added 
immediately to every portfolio. We expect a continuous flow of huge 
news announcements while shares still represent an uncommon value for a 
Company of this caliber. Look for the continuation of strong positive 
developments that wil| ignite GEEC, which earns our highest rating for 
the 
most exp|osive gains on Wa|l Street.
