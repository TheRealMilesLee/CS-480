Dear Friend,
Firstly, this is not to cause you embarrassment, I am
Dr.Colin Jones, a personal friend and business
associate to late Mr. Williams Henry(untill his death)
who used to be a private contractor with the Shell
Petroleum Development Company in Saudi Arabia. On
December 25th, 2002,
my friend and his wife with their three children were
involved in an auto crash, all occupants of the
vehicle unfortunately lost their lives.

Since then, I have made several enquiries with his
country embassy to locate any of his extended
relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After
these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to
contact you with this proposal. I have contacted you
to assist in repatriating this huge amount of money
left behind by my friend before they get confiscated
or declared unserviceable by the BANK/INSTITUTION
where these huge deposit was lodged.

The deceased had a deposit presently valued USD16.5M
which I am aware of and the BANK has issued to his
persoanl attorney a notice to provide his next of kin
or Beneficiary by Will otherwise have the account
confiscated within the next thirty official working
days.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the
relatives
for almost a year now as well as the attorney, I
therefore
seek  your consent to present you as the next of
kin/Will
Beneficiary to the deceased so that the proceeds of
this
account valued at USD16.5M can be paid to you.

Don't worry how this is going to be done. If you give
me your williness to do this with me, I will have to
inform the attorney that I have at last found a
relative to his late client and the attorney will now
present you to the bank as the next of Kin and
then, the proceedings for the transfer will commence.

This will be disbursed or shared in these percentages,
60% for me, 30% for you, 5% for charity organizations
while the balance 5% will be set aside for any
expenses.

All I require is your honest Co-operation,
Confidentiality
and Trust to enable us see this transaction through.

I guarantee you that this will be executed under a
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any
breach of the law.

I am presently in London and I ask for your
cooperation to provide me the following information:

1. full name(s)
2. your telephone(mobile preferably) and fax numbers
3. your current physical Address.

Your urgent response will be highly anticipated and
appreciated.

Best regard

Colin Jones
