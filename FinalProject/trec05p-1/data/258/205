was never generous=2C I was always hostile to people and only focused on 
my business as that was the only thing I cared for=2E But now I regret all 
this=2C as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to

charity organizations in the U=2EA=2EE=2CAlgeria and Malaysia=2E Now that my 
health has deteriorated so badly=2C I cannot do this myself anymore=2E I once 
asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute 
the money=2C which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and 
Pakistan=2C they refused and kept the money to themselves=2E Hence=2C I do not 
trust them anymore=2C as they seem not to be contended with what I have 
left for them=2E
