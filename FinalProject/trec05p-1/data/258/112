FYI

Joe Parks just completed the sale of the gas in storage at the Centana Facility.  Below you will see confirmation of our receipt of the sales price.  Joe will send to me (and I can forward to any interested party) the methodology for the sales price calculation.  Of this amount, approximately $225,000 will be escrowed (these are for pre-petition obligations under the storage agreement with Centana) subject to some future resolution.  My understanding is that Ed McMichael and his team will be evaluating what to do with the Centana Storage Agreement (accept or reject).

Stuart
