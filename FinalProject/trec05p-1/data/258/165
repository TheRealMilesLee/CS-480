Dear ,

interested in long term relationship.I am the Son of late
Dr E.Williams ,the former chief accountant of the Gold and
Diamond minning corporation of Sierra Leone, who was
assassinated by the RUF rebels on the 16 of April 2004.

Unfortunately my mother died for hypertension three week
later here in Abidjan and before then my mother has already
advised me to look for a person abroad who will assist me
by fronting as the foreign partner to our father on whose
behalf he deposited the sum of $10,000,000.00 Million

This money was deposited with a bank herein Abidjan,it was
deposited for a foreign business with his partners. Now
that I am in Abidjan and verified the deposit, I need your
assistance to help me to transfer this money out,for
investment in your country.

I ask you to scout for a valuable and lucrative business ,
so that both of us can invest wisely, apart from the
relationship. I have in mind to give you 20% of the total ,
and 5% for any expenses which you may incure in course of
this transaction.

By this mail you are now requested to arrange on how this
money will be transfer into your account by sending your
details information like telephone and fax number with your
bank information deatils so that the transfer will be
faster.


Waiting for your quick response .
