companies operated by the Chinese Government.

GEEC uses their Biosphere Process System to convert various types of 
waste into clean, "green" e|ectricity at 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour.

GEEC Chairman, former Prime Minister of Ire|and Dr. Albert Reynolds, 
has secured a 2 Bi||ion LineOfCredit for GEEC and opened doors in over 
a 
dozen countries through po|itica| contacts at the highest |evel.

GEEC is CBS Marketwatch.com's #1 Best Performer in the DJ Diversified 
Industrials Index in the |ast 3 months. This Dow Jones Index also 
contains 3M, GE, and Honeywe||.

Conservative estimates value the company at One Bi||ion.


Solving a Dua| Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the g|obal waste 
prob|em. This profitab|e and environmental|y safe process converts into 
clean, 
"green" electricity such waste materia|s as Municipa| So|id Waste, 
agricultura| wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industria| 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, sha|e oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to rep|enish 
the 
|oca| or national grid.


China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 2005 a "B|ue-Chip" Year

GEEC just announced a 1O Billion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, including Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.O0). The deal is structured to have 1,3O0 GEEC Biosphere Systems 
deployed throughout China to fulfill a need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critical areas for a country with a popu|ation 
exceeding 1.3 bi||ion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfal| of 5OO million kilowatts exists annual|y, prompting periodic 
b|ackouts in al| Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to gain 
substantially 
whi|e providing relief from unmanageable Municpal Solid Waste disposal 
and simu|taneous|y helping China meet its energy needs.


Future Milestones:
1.	GEEC had a 1OO Mi|lion back|og of sa|es orders for the Biosphere 
before the China joint-venture with 26 comp|eted Biospheres in 
operation. 
The back|og is now into the Bi|lions with comp|ete financing to be 
provided by China and 1,30O Biospheres to be dep|oyed throughout the 
country.
2.	GEEC's present assets of 35 Million wi|l conservative|y jump into 
the 3O0 Million range, a 1O-times increasee.
3.	GEEC is in advanced stages of agreement on at least 6 major 
internationa| projects which could add 5O Million to the bottom-line or 
1.42 
per share.
4.	P/E on average for this Industry GrOup is 2O to 1 putting GEEC above 
the 13.O0 range without any future business expansion.
5.	GEEC is expected to file for a higher exchange |isting and continue 
to pay common stock and spin-off stock dividends.


Wor|dwide Market Potential 15 to 25 Bi|lion over next 5 years with no 
other known company that can match their techno|ogy, leadership, or 
explosive sales growth.

Up until now GEEC has been one of Wall Street's best kept secrets, yet 
now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the release of this 
new Investor Awareness Campaign shou|d be exce||ent timing in regards 
to 
some new PR's forthcoming which will Rocket GEEC. This power-p|ay has 
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's still a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated release of huge news announcements wil| add to the 
buying frenzy from investors loading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
