There are currently no minimum term of service requirements in effect for
electric customers returning to bundled service.  Customers may switch as
frequently as they like.  Gas customers, however, must remain with Con
Edison for 12 months when returning from ESCOs.

Hi Rebecca.

In ConEd's Phase 4 Retail Access Implementation Plan and Operating
Procedure, under section 5.3.7. Customers Requesting Con Edison Bundled
Service, it reads (Page 20), "D. Con Edison reserves the right to
establish a minimum term of service for customers under the Schedule for
Electricity Service in connection with transfers from retail access
service to bundled service..." What is ConEd's minimum term of service?
The NY UBP establishes that it should not exceed 12 months. I thank you
in advance for your assistance, Vinio
