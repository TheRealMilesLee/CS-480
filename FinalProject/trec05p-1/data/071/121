I believe Ken will be very interested to read the President's remarks today on the economic stimulus package.  The President specifically said that repeal of the corporate AMT is officially part of his plan.  That's a huge development, and I wanted Ken to know that Team Enron's efforts are making progress.  His calls have been very helpful.

Marc Lampkin from our offices is at a briefing on the stimulus package that
Karl Rove and Lindsey pulled together.  When he gets back I will buzz you. 

Thanks
