Hi Bob,

Thanks very much for your kind offer.  I will definitely take you up on it!  I'll ask Susan Wadle to organize a phone call at a convenient time next week to discuss.

Hi Eric,  Cordes debriefed me on last week's call with TCPL regarding the "McNeill to Chicago bullet" pipeline.  As I understand it you and Danny will lead Enron's participation in a joint venture with TCPL (and possibly others) on this bullet.  FYI, Omaha prepared the cost estimate and rate calculations for the US portion of what TCPL showed to you on September 27th and will be happy to give you and Danny behind the scene support related to those numbers, or anything else we can assist you with.  Bob Hill.
