> Dear ClickAtHome Participant,
>
> ClickAtHome is interested in making sure you have the latest security
> tools available to you.  As part of the ClickAtHome program, you may
> download and update Norton Anti-Virus and BlackICE Defender software
> from the ClickAtHome Portal.
>
> Norton AntiVirus software repairs computer virus infections
> automatically.  It scans and cleans your hard drive, diskettes and
> both incoming and outgoing email.
> BlackICE Defender is an industrial-strength anti-hacker system that
> protects your PC by scanning your DSL, cable modem, or dial-up
> Internet connection looking for hacker activity. When it detects an
> attempted intrusion, it automatically blocks traffic from that source,
> keeping intruders from accessing your system.
> By installing and updating both Norton AntiVirus and BlackICE
> Defender, your ClickAtHome PC will have the latest security offered by
> these two products.
> Instructions for accessing the Portal and downloading the software are
> provided below.
> If you have any questions or wish to provide feedback, please email
> clickathome@enron.com.  Thank you for your participation in
> ClickAtHome.
> The ClickAtHome Team!
> __________________________________
> To download the software:
> 1)  Visit the ClickAtHome Portal at www.clickathome.net from your
> ClickAtHome PC.
> 2)  Logon to the Portal with your personally created Portal User ID
> and Password, or create a new account if you have not created a user
> ID and password by selecting "Create a NEW Account" at the top left
> corner.  The Portal User IDs and Passwords are created by you.  The
> Enron Help Desk is not able to assist with Portal support, but if you
> need any assistance, please send an email to "clickathome@enron.com".
> 3) Once you have logged on, select "Tools" from the top menu bar.
> 4) Under the "Secure Download" heading, click on "BlackICE" or
> "Norton" and log on to the download page using your SAP ID and Date of
> Birth.
