Dear Liz,

The agenda is quite fine as is. Many thanks for including our suggestions. I
guess the next step will be to find speakers. We should be able to line up
about 3 people from RWE and I am sure Enron will contribute in numbers but
obsiouly we want as diversified our panel of speakers as possible.

Best Regards 

Christophe Chassard
