It was a pleasure to see you and Mark Whitt at the Ziff conference.  As I
mentioned, Clatskanie has elected to proceed with negotiations with another
supplier based upon a proposal providing multi-year primary firm Williams
transportation to Deer Island.

And, as we discussed, sometime during November, as plant operations
approach, it would be appropriate for you and Jeff Shields to get together
with the EWEB and Clatskanie folks to present your ideas (suggested in your
proposal) for mutual business opportunities among Enron, Clatskanie, and
EWEB.  Give me a call at that time and we will coordinate a phone call or
meeting.

Thank you for your participation in our RFP.
