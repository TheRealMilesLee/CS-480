It didn't down here b/c I watched it from 5:15 - 6pm unless it actually
came
on 4pm down here with the time difference.  I bet that's what happened.

You'll never believe it but I turned it on at 5:10 so I guess your
interview
was over.  If you have a copy, please send me a copy and I'll pay you
for it.
How's everything going?  Hope all is well.  Talk to you soon.

Kevin
