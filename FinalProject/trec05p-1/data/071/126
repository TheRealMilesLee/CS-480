Can you change the Huber transaction agreement to reflect the pricing provisions we have laid out in the LOI.  The only other thing I saw in the Capacity release agreement was in 2.6.  If they owe us for any refunds prior to the release date, then we should owe them for any charges in the future for any past periods.

Thanks

We are trying to send out a draft version of these on Monday afternoon.


Thanks

Mark
