David A. Forster was granted agent and AIF status via resolution on 28 Mar 01.  If Tana wants it revoked, she will provide a date of revocation.

Please draft the appropriate document for Teresa's review.

Tana - - I'm on vacation 8 - 13 Oct.  The EPMI consent electing Forster as VP is dated 1 Oct 01.  It's on it way to you.

Thanks to everyone.
