FROM THE DESK OF:

MR.ERIC WONG
Wing Lung Bank Ltd.
Kowloon Rd Junction Branch.
Western Province,
Hong Kong.


I am Mr.Eric Wong Human resource Manager of Wing Lung Bank Ltd. I have 
an 
important business proposition for you.

On October 6, 2001, a German Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese 
Solid Minerals Corporation, Mr. Olaf Partetzke made a numbered time 
(Fixed) Deposit 
for twelve calendar months, valued at US$18,500,000.00 (Eighteen 
Million Five Hundred Thousand 
Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification 
to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a 
reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the 
Chinese
Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr.Olaf Partetzke died from a heart 
related aliment
On further investigation, I found out that he died without 
making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Olaf 
Partetzke did not declare
any kin or relations in all his official documents, including 
his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$18,500,000.000 is 
still sitting in 
my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at 
the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 
According to 
Laws of China, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will 
revert to the ownership of the Chinese Government if nobody applies to 
claim the fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to 
stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Olaf Partetzke so that the fruits of 
this old man's labor 
will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.This 
is simple, I will like 
you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the 
attorney will 
prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in 
place as the next of kin. 
We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and 
notarization of the WILL 
and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of 
probate/administration in 
your favor for the transfer. 
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio 
of 60% for me and 35% for you and 5% for Expenses Incurred in the 
course of 
the transaction .
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will 
be done by the attorney and with my position as the Manager with my 
bank will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If 
you 
are interested, please reply
immediately to my email box. eric_wong000@kaixo.com
Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and 
relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
You should observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall 
require your assistance 
to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply.

Thanks and regards.
Mr.Eric Wong
