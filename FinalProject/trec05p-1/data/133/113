Hello,

My name is Mr. Han, Chief Credit Officer (CCO), of an international finan=
ce
company in shanghai, China.
What I have may be of interest to you. It is a business proposal that wil=
l
be beneficial to  both of us.
I have been working in this bank for the past 17 years till I rose to my
present position of Chief Accounts Officer.
I will give you my contact details on your reply to this letter.
My aim of contacting you is to solicit your cooperation and assistance in=

executing this business deal in respect of one of the accounts under my
management valued $8,000,000.00, which has remained dormant for the past
15 years.
This account was owned by late Mrs. Belinda Dan and following investigati=
on,
we confirmed that she died in may 1991 in a car crash and left no childre=
n,
relations or next of kin.
From past experiences and my personal relationship with the late Mrs. Dan=
,
I know that no one will ever come forward to claim the funds. I am theref=
ore
seeking your assistance to claim the fund.
I, in conjunction with a colleague (the Chief Operating Officer) in the
bank now seek your permission to allow an attorney prepare a backdated WI=
LL
in your name, so that the funds would be released to you as the new owner=

(on behalf of you, me and my colleague). 
We are writing you because, as public servants, we cannot operate a forei=
gn
account.
Consequently, I will present you as the owner of the funds so you will be=

able to claim the fund with the help of an attorney. This is simple. I wi=
ll
like you to provide immediately your:
1.Full names in 1990
2.Contact address in 1990
3.Phone/Fax numbers
With the above info, an Attorney will prepare the necessary legal documen=
ts
to back up the  transfer of the fund to you as the new beneficiary. It wi=
ll
then be released to you, for us to split. The Attorney will do all the pa=
perwork
and this will guarantee everything.
Send your response to:  penglee@echina.com
Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and furthe=
r
explanation that will help you understand.
Note also that we shall require your assistance to invest our share in yo=
ur
country. (Buying of properties like houses, hotels etc).
Please treat as confidential and urgent.
Regards.
Han.
