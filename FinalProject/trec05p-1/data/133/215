ATTN: CEO           

Greetings to you and your family. I want you to read
this mail with a compassionate heart and understanding
that any action you take is geared towards rendering
humanitarian assistance to a man who is in distress 
with his family. 

My name is Mr. Denis Lambey, a Liberian( now resident 
in Johannesburg, South Africa) and former aide
to Charles Taylor former President of Liberia. I was
his right hand man before he was asked to step down
from power and he is presently in asylum in Nigeria. I
was handling the diamond sales on behalf of Charles
Taylor while he was in power as president of liberia

It was while I was discharging this duty that I
diverted the sum of US$ 15,000,000.00 (fifteen Million
United States Dollars) for myself. I sealed the
money in metal chest diplomatic luggage and deposited 
in a Security Company as artifacts. Detail of the security 
company shall be known to you when i recieve your positive 
responce to this mail.

I informed President Taylor then, that the
United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSL) seized
the diamond consignment and made report to the United
Nations. It was based on this diamond dealings
involving President Taylor that the United Nations
imposed sanctions on Liberia recently and that led to
his subsequent removal from power. 

Now that he is out of power and situation in my country
is gradually returning to normal. I am looking for a
trusted foreign partner to help me claim the fund 
from the security company and invest wisely. 
It is based on my decision to move the fund out 
for purpose of investment that I am contacting
you to assist me in taking the funds to your country

All you need do is to go to the office of the security
company, claim the consignment and subsequently lodge
the fund into your account. I have already notified
the security company that my partner will come to claim
the consignment. All they require from me is to send 
them the name and contact of my partner so that they 
can handover the consignment to you. You can as well 
open an offshore account were you will lodge the fund 
before transfering to your country. 

After you have lodged the fund in your account, i shall 
be coming over to your country for my share and also 
you can advise me on areas i can invest my share

I am willing to compensate you with 30% of the total
sum for your assistance and want to let you understand
that the future of myself and family depends solely on
this money .In this transaction confidentiality is
very essential for us to achieve our goal. It is 
important that you maintain utmost good faith and trust .
You must also not circumvent the transaction in any way. 

In conclusion I will like you to understand that this 
transaction is risk free. 

I await your swift response 

DENIS LAMBEY
