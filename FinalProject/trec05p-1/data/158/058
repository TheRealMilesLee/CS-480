This is just a friendly reminder for the following event (and if you plan to attend, please respond to me directly):
Who are these so called account managers, Rich, Jenny and Mark? What do they do? How can we leverage off their expertise and they, ours? Do they have specific company contacts? Where can they be found? Will the ubiquitous pizza be served to entice you to attend? Strong possibility. Will I have to sign up on Bear Tracks? No. How can attending benefit me? It's up to you.

To answer these questions and many more, we will be scheduling during -

Thu, Dec. 6 during the break as well in the Career Center Conference Room (S420)

an informational session with the account managers.

Here's a description that Rich Wong, the financial services account manager prepared:

"The Haas Career Center staff includes 3 account managers that
can be a valuable resource to those that are exploring job or career
direction changes. Their role is to be the primary liaison for recruiters
in their specific industry sectors, being the one-stop shop point person
for companies interested in connecting with Haas MBA students.  They
cover a full spectrum of responsibilities from the logistics of setting up
presentations and interviews to establishing contacts and providing
strategic guidance to recruiters (including both hiring managers as well
as University Recruiting reps within human resource departments).
Through this activity, they gain insights into their company/industry
focus that they are happy to share with Haas students, John Morel,
and the other career advisors in the Haas Career Center."

Feel free to contact them regarding questions on companies and industries
that they represent.  Conversely, please provide them with any valuable
contacts that you have in current/former employers that might help them aid your
schoolmates to find employment opportunities. They are located in the Recruitment Center
(S330 by the ATM machine) and their contact information is as follows:

Mark Friedfeld - Financial Services (Investment and Commercial Banking, Real
Estate, Venture Capital)
