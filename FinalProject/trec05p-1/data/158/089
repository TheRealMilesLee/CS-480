Michelle,

Do you see a problem with me providing continued approval on bridging of service for employees that are applicable or should I treat those on a case by case basis as well.  The request below is directly from an HR Rep.

Please advise.

Thanks.

Davette

Jim Pond came over with Columbia Energy and all of their service should be bridged.  His date should be 4/17/98 for service as well as vesting.

Thanks
Estalee
