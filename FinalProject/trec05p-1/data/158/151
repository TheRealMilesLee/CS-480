Bill, please coordinate TW's response to the questions set forth in the Order.  We probably ought to think about how we communicate with USGT regarding responses.  I plan to talk with Mary Kay and Kilmer regarding regulatory support.  Although I don't want to get involved with a territory dispute, I think it would be smart for MKM's group to handle for consistency.  That's going to be my recommendation to them.  Thanks again for your help yesterday.  Greg
