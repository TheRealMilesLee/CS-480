On Saturday morning, Annie took a decided turn for the worst.  The
Prednisone therapy had worked wonders for a few weeks (as the vet predicted)
- but her illness finally prevailed.  We made all her favorite things, but
we could not even get her to take a drop of water.  Last night Jeff came
over and sat with her and this morning Prentice and Eldon took her to the
vet and had her put to sleep.   They stayed with her the whole time and we
will take her ashes up to Mendocino where she had such fun.  She was a truly
great dog - and we will all miss her!  Thank you all for the love and caring
you gave her over the years.
