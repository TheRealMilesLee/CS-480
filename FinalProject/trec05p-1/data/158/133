Dear, 

I am Mrs. SUHA ARAFAT, the wife of YASSER ARAFAT, the
Palestinian leader who died recently in Paris. Since
his death and even prior to the announcement, I have
been thrown into a state of antagonism, confusion,
humiliation,frustration and hopelessness by the
present leadership of the Palestinian Liberation
Organization and the new Prime Minister. I have even
been subjected to physical and psychological torture.
As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost
confidence with everybody in the country at the
moment. 

You must have heard over the media reports and the
Internet on the discovery of some fund in my husband
secret bank account and companies and the allegations
of some huge sums of money deposited by my husband in
my name of which I have refuses to disclose or give up
to the corrupt Palestine Government. 

In fact the total sum allegedly discovered by the
Government so far is in the tune of about $6.5 Billion
Dollars. And they are not relenting on their effort to
make me poor for life. As you know, the Moslem
community has no regards for woman, more importantly when
the woman is from a christian background, hence my desire
for a foreign assistance. 

I have deposited the sum of $21 million dollars with a
Financial firm in Europe whose name is withheld for
now until we open communication. 

I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund
into your bank account for safe keeping and any
Investment opportunity. This arrangement will be known
to you and I alone and all our correspondence should
be strictly on email alone because our government has
tapped all my lines and are monitoring all my moves. 

In view of the above, if you are willing to assist for
our mutual benefits, we will have to negotiate on your
Percentage share of the $21,000,000 that will be kept
in your position for a while and invested in your name
for my trust pending when my Daughter, Zahwa, will
come off age and take full responsibility of her
Family Estate/inheritance. 

Please note that this is a golden opportunity that
comes once in life time and more so, if you are
honest, I am going to entrust more funds in your care
as this is one of the legacy we keep for our children. 

In case you don't accept please do not let me out to
the security and international media as I am giving
you this information in total trust and confidence I
will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in
good faith. 

Please expedite action.


Yours sincerely, 

Suha Arafat
