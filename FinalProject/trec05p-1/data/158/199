Read each sentence slowly and think about it.

Love starts with a smile, grows with a kiss, and ends
with a tear.

Don't cry over anyone who won't cry over you.

Good friends are hard to find, harder to leave, and
impossible to forget.

You can only go as far as you push.

Actions speak louder than words.

The hardest thing to do is watch the one you love,
love somebody else.

Don't let the past hold you back, you're missing the
good stuff.

Life's short. If you don't look around once in a while
you might miss it.

A BEST FRIEND is like a four leaf clover, HARD TO FIND
and LUCKY TO HAVE.

Some people make the world SPECIAL just by being in
it.

BEST FRIENDS are the siblings God forgot to give us.

When it hurts to look back, and you're scared to look
ahead, you can look beside you and your BEST FRIEND
will
be there.

TRUE FRIENDSHIP "NEVER" ENDS. Friends are FOREVER.

Good friends are like stars....You don't always see
them, but you know they are always there.

Don't frown. You never know who is falling in love
with
your smile.

What do you do when the only person who can make you
stop crying is the person who made you cry?

Nobody is perfect until you fall in love with them.

Everything is okay in the end. If it's not okay, then
it's not the end.

Most people walk in and out of your life, but only
friends leave footprints in your heart.

Send this on to everyone special in your life, even
the
people who really make you mad sometimes and to the
people whose lives you want to be in!!!

And send it back to the person who sent it too you
if they mean something to you !!

Remember, every minute spent angry is sixty seconds of
happiness wasted.


AWESOME PRAYER:
May today there be peace within you. May you trust
God
that you are exactly where you are meant to be. "I
believe that friends are quiet angels who lift us to
our
feet when our wings have trouble remembering how to
fly."

Just send this to (4) people and see what happens on
the
fourth day. Do not break this, please. There is no
cost,
but lots of rewards.
