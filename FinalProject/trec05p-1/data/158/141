PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

ATTN: DIRECTOR/CEO

I am Wodi Martins (FCAA), the chief accountant of African Development Bank
(ADB). There is an account open in this bank in 1999 and since 2001 nobody
has operated on this account again. After going through some old files in
the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it
would be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. Smith B.
Andreas, a foreigner, and a miner at Kruger Gold Company, a Geologist by
profession and he died since 2000.No other person knows this account or
anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my
investigation proved to me as well that this company does not know anything
about this account and the money involved is Thirty Six Million United
States Dollars (US$36 Million). I want us to first transfer US$6 Million
from this money into your safe overseas account before the rest. I am only
contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a
local bank here, but can only be approved to any foreign account because the
money is in United States Dollars and the former owner Mr. Smith B. Andreas
is a foreigner too. I know that this message will come to you as surprise as
we don’t know ourselves before. We will sign an agreement, but be sure that
it is real and a genuine business.

I only got your contact information from my secretary who operates computer;
with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business,
considering my position as a public servant. You are the only person that I
have contacted in this business; so please reply urgently so that I will
inform you the next step to take immediately. Send also your private
telephone and fax numbers including the full details of your account to be
used for the deposit. I want us to meet face-to-face and sign a binding
agreement to bind us together so that you can receive this money into your
account where the fund will be safe. And I will fly to your country for
withdrawal and sharing and other investment. Meanwhile, I am contacting you
because of the need to involve a foreigner with foreign account and foreign
beneficiary. I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because
the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has
correct information of this account, which I will give to you as soon as you
indicate your sincerity to co-operate with me, and capability to handle such
amount in strict confidence and trust according to my instruction and advice
for our mutual benefit because this opportunity may never come again in my
life.

I need a truthful and God fearing person in this business because I don’t
want to make a mistake so I need your strong assurance and trust. With my
position in the office I don’t want anything that will jeopardize my job so
I advice that we should make secrecy and confidentiality our primary working
condition, bearing in mind that I am a public servant. I will also use my
position and influence to effect legal approvals and onward transfer of this
money to your account with appropriate clearance forms of the ministries and
foreign exchange department. At the conclusion of this business, you will be
giving 35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for
expenses both parties might have incurred the process of the transfer. I
look forward to your earliest reply.

Yours sincerely,

Wodi Martins
