Building Houston's Future, Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign, officially kicks off today and runs through August 17.  Last year your support helped Enron raise $2.8 million, which was 21 percent more than our original goal.  

This year, we hope to reach our employee goal of $2.9 million.  Enron will match every employee's contribution dollar-for-dollar.  We ask that employees who gave last year consider increasing their pledge this year, and that those who did not give, consider making a modest donation.

The decision to focus this year's campaign on Building Houston's Future came directly from our employees, who rallied to help Houston recover from the flood damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison. Enron employees have expressed a strong desire to continue assisting those in need until our city fully recovers.  We will also be focusing on our United Way Scholars program, an innovative program created this year by Enron and the United Way.  The Scholars program builds Houston's future business leaders by targeting talented students who may be overlooked by other scholarship programs.

ON-LINE PLEDGING 
We will once again utilize an on-line pledging system to streamline the pledge process that will require your HRGIS ID (shown below). Click on <https://hrglobal.enron.com> or go to <http://home.enron.com> to make your contribution and learn more about this year's campaign. Please make your electronic pledge no later than Friday, August 17.  

DAYS OF CARING 
We are focusing on flood relief, and on our business units, by replacing the traditional large-scale kick-off event with Days of Caring, which will take place Tuesday through Friday of this week. We invite you to join your business unit for a Day of Caring at your 2001 Adopted Agency. This year's adopted agencies were selected in part due to the amount of flood damage suffered by the agency or its clients. To sign up for Day of Caring, log on to <http://cr.enron.com/cr-cgi-bin/view_volops.pl>. 

APPRECIATION LUNCH
Rounding out the Days of Caring is an Appreciation Event on Friday, August 10 in Antioch Park from 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m.  Come celebrate the success of Days of Caring, enjoy a free Chic-Fil-A lunch and watch a team of your coworkers compete against the other business units by creating building block structures that exemplify Enron attributes: Smart, Innovative, Bold, Ambitious, and United.  Jackie Martin, President of the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast, will join us in judging the structures. If you bring down the building blocks that were on your chair this morning and donate them to our 2001 Adopted Agencies, you will be entered in a drawing for two free round-trip airline tickets anywhere in the U.S.

Thank you for your generosity. We look forward to your participation and seeing you throughout the week at Days of Caring and at the Appreciation Event on Friday!

If you have any questions regarding the online application, please call the HRGIM help desk at ext. 3-5666.
