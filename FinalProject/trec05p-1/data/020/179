Don:

Per our phone conversation last night, according to the August schedule I'm scheduled to work the night of Fri 17th and Sat 18th.  As mentioned a few weeks ago I have signed up to attend a Sunday school retreat that weekend.  I've actually been ask to speak Fri night and would really like to do all I can to attend.  Currently we have 4 guys scheduled to work Sat night, so my absence shouldn't be a big deal, however, Friday's schedule just has me and Mauricio (there's currently no ERCOT guy scheduled so if that changes, my problem is solved).  I attempted to work out a trade with a few guys with no success.  Maybe even Brant Reves can be scheduled that night if no ERCOT is penciled in.  Anything we could work out would be GREATLY appreciated, even if I have to give up vacation time it's not a problem.  

As for the GMAT and graduate school reimbursement we discussed, I was told to contact my Business Unit Mgr for the necessary info.  As you know Enron must sponsor my application into UH's Executive MBA program so any guidance you can provide me with is appreciated.  

One last thing.  I currently hold a NASD Series 7 & 63 licenses.  These licenses need to be housed with Enron to prevent them from expireing.  Who would I contact about housing them here?

Thanks for all you help Don.

Sincerely,
Andrew
