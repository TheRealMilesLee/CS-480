Subject:  Billing Procedure Question

As discussed with Cara,  EPE would like to continue to be billed the .25 as
was done for July (as an annuity).  It will not be necessary to fold in the
fee with the per MWH charge.

Hi Kathy,

I spoke with Greg Wolfe who is putting the final touches on the contract
ammendment, and the billing in his stuff looks a little different than
what we have discussed.

He is showing that when we transact directly with you,  we adjust the
price to fold the .25 charge into the deal.  This will have the effect
of lowering the monthly charge for the "Schedule Bill", and may help you
all with the PUC side of this service. This adjustment would also be
done on any deals that we enter into our system on your behalf. The
charge would not show up on the sheet, we can modify the formulas to
make sure that only the direct bill stuff gets charged there.

Is this going to work for you?

I explained that I billed July separately for everything, and do not
want to adjust all the July deals to do this, and he was OK with that.

Please call or e-me with your comments on this, I want to get things
flowing smoothly just as fast as we can.

Thanks!

Cara
