     Barry: I will send a note to Jacy. Also the funds I think we will
go 
     into are going to be more heavily weighted towards stocks, but will
     
     have some bonds as well, that what makes them a balanced fund.
Also, 
     do want us to manage the money Jacy has, or do you want to leave it
     
     with him? No problem either way, just let me know.

I wasn't worried for a second.
     
I would like to have these funds in a portfolio that has a better 
performance than money markets. I already have a decent amount of money 
( 60K) in the Rice portfolio thru andrew agencies in Virden. You may 
want to look at exactly what that is, contact Jacy Whyte at Andrew 
Agencies... he will get you the details for Kim and I. 
     
Was there a particular index fund you had in mind? What do you mean by 
balanced ? Once we put it there I don't plan on touching or managing 
this until I return to Canada.  
     
Thanks, talk to you soon.

     Barry:
     
     You probably thought I had forgotten about you! I had not. I wanted
to 
     iron out some areas of concern from my end here. As you know, I am
not 
     supposed to do an investment for you while you are a resident of
the 
     US. I have discovered that if we put the money into an account and
not 
     make moves on it until you move back to Canada, then we can do it
if I 
     use a Canadian address. I was advised to put the money into a
balanced 
     fund and leave it there for now. My thoughts are to move it to a 
     couple of funds in a self administered account and NOT make any
moves 
     with it. 
     
     Please review this note, and let me know what you think. If all is
ok 
     I will mail you the forms to sign (which you signed here), and we
will 
     get this moving.
     
     Hope all is well with you down there.
     
     Regards
     Rob
