Speaking for the Californians, we have not doubted the rightness of our arguments for a minute.  We've been proud to represent Enron, even if some of you at corporate cannot travel in our fair state without donning false mustaches, and continue to advocate with heart.  Its been an exciting ride, and it ain't over yet.  Thanks for the opportunity to fight the good fight with a group of very impressive professionals who've managed to keep some sense of humor during our darkest days.
