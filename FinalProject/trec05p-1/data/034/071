Following- up on our conversation regarding mercaptan sulfur on Agave's gas:


TW- Gas Quality requirements:	Shall not contain not more than .3 grains mercaptan sulfur per one 100 cubic of gas. Their letter indicates that it is 
more than 0.3 grains/ 100 cf. Therefore we have to tell them to treat the gas or TW has to install an instrument like Delmar 7200 with                     on -off shut- in devices to monitor the mercaptan in the gas at the receipt point.

Again, this is from the planning point of view and perhaps we need to talk to Operations also.
