How are you today? I am Dr. Thomas Fernandez a consultant cardiologist and I guess you must be apprehensive as we have not met personally before now.
Over the years, I had patient Mrs. Patricia Maria Gonzales who had 
protracted illness and I was very close to her in her last days. I was not too surprised I was mentioned in her Will. She also left specific Instructions that I look out for someone of repute to put to use the sum of Seventeen Million Four Hundred and Fifty thousand United States Dollars (USD$17.450.000.00). for Humanitarian Activities.
I have recieved routine notifications from her investor over the years now. I did look out for a couple of well known names here and abroad who could administer these funds for Humanitarian Activities.Following the aftermath of Sept.11th when some of these well known names were found not to have used the funds given to them for Humanitarian Activities, I then decided to look out for someone whom I could introduce to the investor as someone who will administer the usage of the funds.
After proper discussions, I will write to her investor and introduce 
you. I intend to use 50% of the total sum personally for Humanitarian Activities in accordance with the wish of Mrs. Patricia Maria Gonzales. This way, I will be sure that the funds are judiciously put to use. As I am looking at some war-ravaged countries of the world and also some of the poorest nations 
of the world. 
I am offering you 20% for your help. You might wonder why I 
have decided to look for someone whom I have not had transactions with before, this is as a result of the fact that I prefer to have this transaction with someone whom after collection would proceed back to his country and not with someone whom I will have to continually live with. He might later develop negative ideas in the future so I will prefer to have this sorted out with someone not too close.
 However, if you do not feel comfortable with the transaction, please feel free and discontinue while I want to reassure 
you though that you have nothing to worry about.
I await your response.

Dr. Thomas Fernandez.
