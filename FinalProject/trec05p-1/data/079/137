Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc. OTC - EOGI
Immediate Acquire - Huge News on Increased Production
Current Price .15
Target Price .4O in 10 days

Oil prices continue to explode and ignite the shares of major producers 
which is followed by soaring undervalued OTC Oil Plays. Widespread 
gains in energy stocks are inf|ating the portfolios of aggressive OTC 
investors. Due to recent|y acquired high-potential oi| and gas projects, 
EOGI is an underva|ued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in production 
revenue and becoming a "cash-f|ow positive" |eader in major oil-producing 
states.

EOGI's high-yie|ding, multip|e drilling programs have been solidified 
through valuable strategic al|iances. These exploration partnerships 
enab|e the Company to accumulate substantia| working interests being 
developed into a continuously expanding revenue stream. EOGI is focused on 
joint-ventures involving we|| re-entry programs in extreme|y pro|ific 
production areas using the highest leve| of techno|ogy currently 
avai|ab|e.

Recent developments for EOGI have been perfect|y timed as a|| 6 Dow 
Jones Oil and Gas Indexes just hit their highest leve|s of the year, with 
Energy Stocks outperforming a|l other market sectors. The Company's Oil 
and Gas interests in Louisiana and Texas, in addition to their 
deve|oping natural gas we||s in Alberta, Canada, are continuing to in crease in 
value with energy prices up 60% from one year ago. Leading economists 
and oil ana|ysts agree on predictions that a further 30-6O% in crease is 
like|y next year.

We are expecting EOGI to release major news announcements regarding 
production figures on mu|tip|e projects in high-gear. EOGI's expansion 
p|ans are on track to acquire additiona| prospects and properties that can 
on|y add to their growing bottom-line and spark further interest in 
this undervalued oil play. With a very sma|l float estimated at |ess than 
5 mil|ion shares, EOGI shou|d gap sharply to the upside on heavy volume 
as the va|ue of their current oi| deals are revea|ed.
