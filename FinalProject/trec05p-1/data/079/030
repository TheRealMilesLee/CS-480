Subject: Please read if you have suggestions on how to maintain life/work 
balance while attending the EveMBA program.

Have you ever said "I wish I knew what I know now when I started the 
Evening MBA program"?
If you have ever had a great mentor or coach in your life you can 
appreciate the value of a little information at the right time.   Or maybe 
you did not have a mentor/coach, but wished you had.
Well...now is the time to give back to your fellow MBA colleagues and 
strengthen our collective community by sharing your experience with them.
Specifically we are interested in gathering any:
Lessons learned
Advice
Strategies
Tricks
Great ideas
anecdotes
Any nuggets of wisdom that have helped you to deal with the life/family, 
work, school-balancing act!  These can be ones you came up with, an article 
or book you read or suggestions given to you by a mentor or coach.
Some possible topic areas are:
Managing visibility at work,
Dealing with competing demands
Friday night date/night--how to make sure your loved ones recognize you
How to strategically say NO!
Minimizing crisis and maintaining some quality of life while being in the 
EveMBA program.

Please share any and all tips or suggestions.  Your help and insight will 
be greatly appreciated. The results will be used in an evening break 
seminar on Life Work Balance while in B-school.

To contribute your pearls of wisdom just hit reply and start typing.  On 
behalf of your peers--thanks for sharing.

This is a joint effort by Jon Bain (current EveMBA student) and John Morel.
