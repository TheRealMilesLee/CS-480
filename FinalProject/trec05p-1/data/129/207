It would appear logical that in the right sizing of the of EIM and specifically the steel group that my commercial skills will likely not be fully utilized or possibly even required in the future. In turn I wanted to inquire of you if you believe there is another use of my skills within the organization prior to advancing outside of the company.

You know my capabilities well so I thought you could make a judgment call fairly easily and I then I can progress in whatever direction makes the most sense for both of us. 

I know you have a lot on your plate these days but I thought it would be easier ask you directly. Let me know your thoughts or if you want to have a cup of coffee.

Thanks

MFG
