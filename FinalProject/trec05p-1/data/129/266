Gary and I discussed this today and he is going to have Frankie pull the charts and input the daily volumes in PGAS.  We will compare and see what the impact is to the DDVC penalties.  Any questions please give me a call.  j.  floyd

Gary,  I received a call on 11/13 from Bill Lindley (Clayton Energy) agent for City of Hartley, IA.  Bill was inquiring about the actual daily volume allocations at POI 60551, Meter Number 722015-01.  He incurred about $5,503.35 in DDVC penalties for the month of Oct.  2001 due to daily variances at the TBS.  Bill was asking if the actuals were estimated from the 17th - 31st.  In checking with Frankie the end of the month index readings were used to estimate the volume due to the chart being received after close.  

Bill (Clayton Energy) has requested that we pull the chart(s) and check the reading to verify that the penalties and the daily volume are correct for the month of Oct..  Bill has provided me with the daily readings from his check meter at this TBS to compare with.  This check will determine if the daily volumes need to be reallocated and a PPA generated.  

Give me a call if you have any questions.
