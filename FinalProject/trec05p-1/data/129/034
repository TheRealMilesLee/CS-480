The Hall-Yoder Daily Assessment Index for Tuesday, November 13 and Wednesday, November 14, 2001:  +1

We are finding new footing after a time of  floundering in quicksand.    The solidification of the sense that there is not going to be a quick recovery,  high level remarks about keeping Enron's trading talent intact, and encounters with counterparties like Seattle and Snohomish who seem to take a kind of nonplussed (clueless?) view of the whole situation, all suggest that the storm may be over and we are going to be able to gird up for a long steady march to a different promised land,  Houston toxins notwithstanding.  

In the morning, the crow community seemed harassed by the strong winds and were seen heading up river in a southerly direction, while the afternoon provided a view of a large raptor, some kind of hawk, or perhaps an osprey, circling high above the city's downtown core.
