Hi Philiip,

I've granted you access to publish the Trading Track reports.   If you don't already have the "Executive Report Publisher" add-ins in your excel applications, please call me and I can walk you through the process.

Kam Keiser suggested that I email you regarding ERV publishing access.  I am taking over the East desk from her and I need to be able to publish the trading track books to ERV.  Please shout with any questions or concerns.  Thanks.
