Lee,

Here is the Agave I/C agreement.  I made a few changes.  Please review:

Para 1:  Agave....a New Mexico corporation...
Article 2.1:  term of ...five (5) years
Article 3.3:  New paragraph.  Please wordsmith as necessary.  Also, notice the weird indentation on 3.1 and 3.2.  Can you help this?
Article 8.5:  filled in detail on Agave contacts as per their request. 

Let me know.  Thanks, Kim.
