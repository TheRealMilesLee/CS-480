Hello again,

I don't know if you received my first email, so I'm writing you again.  I just got set up on this service and I don't know if everything is working correctly.  Anyway, this is where I compliment you on how attractive you look and how interesting your profile is. (I hope it's working) I've included mine so you can get an idea as to who I am.  If you would like to talk further drop me a line.

Paul

The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

However:

* Check to ensure that your email address is not in the BODY of your
