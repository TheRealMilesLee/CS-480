Habitat for Humanity Project
 
 November 26, 2001
 
 If you want to work on a Habitat house this year, next week should be your 
final chance.  Last Saturday, we completed the siding and soffits and most of 
the trim on our house.  What remains should go quickly on December 1 (just in 
time for Christmas shopping). The plumbing was also completed but the 
inspection did not taken place.  By next week, we should have the paint for 
the second exterior coat and the landscaping materials.  In addition, we will 
try to finish the siding, soffits and trim on the Dalferes house.  I asked 
again about interior and exterior doors and windows, but the project is so 
far behind, and the concrete construction requires such different techniques, 
that Habitat wants to wrap up the project with contractors.  From the 
Franco’s standpoint, that's probably a good thing.
 
Please let me know if you can help out on December 1.  Many of you have 
already called or written and I appreciate your diligence.  We will have so 
much to do this weekend, with jobs for all skill levels, that having a crowd 
would not be a hindrance. The landscaping and exterior painting will also be 
a great opportunity to get some more kids involved.  If you can help, even 
for a half day, you will be very welcome.  We will plan for food and drink 
again and the lunchtime party is worth the price of admission (Thanks Ken!).  
Also, please let me know if we will need van or car pool service. 
 
While you are considering your schedules, don't forget the dedication for the 
home when it is completed.  Once we know when the Franco’s can move in, we 
will schedule a get together with them to dedicate the house and hold an 
informal celebration.  Second, we will present a housewarming gift of a 
clothes washer and dryer through Habitat.  If you would like to help in 
acquiring the washer and dryer, please make a check out to St. Paul’s UMC and 
indicate “Habitat” on the memo line.  Finally, Habitat is planning to build 
50 homes next year, and has to complete 42 of them by September in order to 
meet the terms of the HUD loans used to acquire the land.  The homes will be 
of traditional frame and siding construction, and Habitat is gearing up for 
another intensive building program.  Please let me know if you are interested 
in participating in the build, and whether you want to assist in the planning.
 
If any of you have questions or comments, please feel free to respond by 
email or call me at 713-748-3317.
 
See you Saturday!
 
Les
