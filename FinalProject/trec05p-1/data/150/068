I have your EOL budget numbers.  Also, we really need to talk about this credit idea soon.  FSA and VMAC are anxious to do a deal, and I really think it can work.

Brad,

I had a conversation with Wally Turbeville from VMAC at around 11 AM. From his conversations with the main players in the industry he got feedback that "they are very enthousiastic about negotiating a deal that would free cash for Enron" (his words). He offered his support to negotiate with the industry players and wants to set up a meeting sometimes this week.
