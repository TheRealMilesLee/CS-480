Mike/Jeff:

Attached is a list from the Enron Corporate Secretay's Office of the Enron companies where you are a Board member and/or an officer, noting your title.

It is my understanding that the Enron Director/Officer Liability Insurance Policy does apply to directors/officers of each of these companies.

Let me know what questions you have and I'll do my best to answer them or promptly find an answer.

Regards, Alan
