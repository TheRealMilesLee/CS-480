Thanks for your response Kay.  May I assume that you are ok with the draft
of the letter  we forwarded to you on Wednesday of last week regarding
revised pay off amounts.  If yes, I will revise that letter and have it
executed by NorthWestern.

Hi Jerry,
 
Steve told me that he had asked whoever he spoke to at NorthWestern to take
steps to extinguish the letter agreement that Enron and GE regarding the
transaction.  I have prepared a letter to that effect and sent it to Steve
for his review.  Basically it just says that Enron doesn't have any
continuing obligations to GE under the previous letter.
 
Before we release the funds we would like to get an executed, revised letter
fromN orthWestern concerning the revised set off amounts and final total to
bew ired.  My fax number is 713 646 3491.
 
I did not have the certificate signed, but will dig it out and see what I
can do.  Quite frankly I just overlooked it.
 
Kay
