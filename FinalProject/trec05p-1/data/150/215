Mary,

I'm sending this on Kim's behalf since her Outlook is overloaded.  Please see attached schedules for Operations and OSS.  We have not reduced our expenses from Plan at this point.  With the reorganization, we are not comfortable reducing our costs until we have completed a thorough analysis.

  

If you have any questions, please call Kim or me.

Thanks,  Elaine
