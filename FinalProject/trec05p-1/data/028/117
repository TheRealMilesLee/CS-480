Dear Friend,

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for
me, because, I believe everyone will die someday.

My name is Peter Smith, a merchant in Dubai, in the
U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal Cancer
which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in
taking care of my health. It has defiled all forms of
medicine, and right now I have only about a few
months to live, according to medical experts.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I
never really cared for anyone, not even myself but my
business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous,
I was always hostile to people and only focus on my
business as that was the only thing I cared for. But
now I regret all this as I have realise that there is more
to life than just wanting to have or make all the
money in the world. I believe when God gives me a
second chance to come to this world I would live my
life a different way from how I have lived it.

Now that God has called me, I have willed and given
most of my properties and assets to my immediate and
extended family members and as well as a few close
friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my
soul . So, I have decided to give arms to charity
organizations and give succour and comfort to the less
priviledged in our societies, as I want this to be one
of the last good deeds I do on earth.

So far, I have distributed money to some charity
organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now
that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do
this my self anymore. I once asked members of my
family to close one of my accounts and distribute the
money which I have there to charity organization and
to the less priviledged in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they
refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do
not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be
contempted with what I have left for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the
cash deposit of fifteen million dollars(15m) that I
have with a Security Company in Europe for safe
keeping. I will want you to help me collect this
deposit and disburse it to some charity organizations
and to the less priviledged.

Please send me a mail to indicate if you will assist
me in this disbursement.
I have set aside 10% for your time and
patience.

You can e-mail me at my private e-mail address:=20
psmith12003@hotmail.com for easy communication.=20
While I await to hear from you, may God be with you and
your entire family.

Remain blessed,

PETER SMITH
