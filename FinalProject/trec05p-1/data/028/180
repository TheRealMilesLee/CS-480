Darin,

Since the volume on this ENA deal is on PGEV (EPGT Texas) Pipeline, the ENA Volume Management contact is Hakeem Ogunbunmi.  His number is X-31801 and he has been cc'd on this note.  

FYI - ENA Volume Management has assumed all of the volume duties associated with all Texas deals that are not specifically on Houston Pipe Line.  For those on Houston Pipe Line, I will still be the contact.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Buddy
X-31933

Buddy - Daren Farmer called and said that on 4/30/2001, on HPL deal #108058, that there was around 20,000 MMBTU scheduled, but when it was actualized, it was actualized at 0.  He thinks this is incorrect.  Can you check into this and get back with Daren?  I'll be out of the office tomorrow, so please get back with him directly.  Thanks.
