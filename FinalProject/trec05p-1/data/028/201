In addition to the interstate pipeslines, following are LDCs where we'll need proprietary file upload capability.

Michigan Consolidate Gas
Northern Illinois Gas Company
The Peoples Gas Light & Coke (Unify code may not be available for this pipe yet)

Thanks again!

Tammy/Shane:

The attached file contains interstate pipelines EES does business on currently.  Once EES is moved to the new environment, we would like to have EDI capability upon launch.

If you could please initiate the TPA's accordingly and begin the testing process.  TPA's should be initiated for Enron Energy Services, Inc. and Enron Energy Marketing, Inc.  (note:  the attached spreadsheet also includes transportation contracts for most of the East Desk pipes; I am working with the desks to obtain the rest of the information needed.)

Please get with Donna if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Lisbet (5-4179)
