Dear Rod,

Tomorrow is my last day and I wanted to thankyou before leaving for school. It was a great opportunity this year to work in the Power industry and can safely say that I had a great time with my group. I had my exit interview yesterday and was made an offer for next year as an Analyst so I will probably be seeing you soon. I shall keep in contact during the semester, but again, thanks for everything.

Regards,

Denka Wangdi
