Dear Jeff,

I was saddened to hear that you have decided to leave Enron.  I couldn't help but reflect back to this past April when I had the opportunity to travel with you for two consecutive days to Harvard and NYU and remember the pearls of wisdom that you imparted about business on our flight.  I will remember them always!  I would like to wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors and thank you for a great two years that I have had with the A/A program here at Enron.  I will find it a great honor if you feel that I can be of any assistance in the future.  Thank you.

Sincerely,

Shalesh Ganjoo
