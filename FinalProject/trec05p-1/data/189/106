Are you feeling okay?

Don't let it end like this. Tell them I said something. [Last words of Pancho Villa]
Mine is better than ours.
A single rose can be my garden... a single friend, my world.

Imperfect preparation gives rise to the thousand-fold forms that express physical and mental inferiority and insecurity.
Life consists not in holding good cards but in playing those you hold well.
God, our Creator, has stored within our minds and personalities, great potential strength and ability. Prayer helps us tap and develop these powers.I think vital religion has always suffered when orthodoxy is more regarded than virtue. The scriptures assure me that at the last day we shall not be examined on what we thought but what we did.
Great men are always of a nature originally melancholy.
