ATTN: SIR/MADAM,

It is my pleasure to contact you in a situation like this, I know that th=
e
content of this letter might be a surprise to you, but even though we har=
dly
know each other, but i believe that you can help me.

I am Mrs. Mariam Abacha, the widow of the late Gen.Sanni Abacha former Ni=
gerian
Military Head of State who died mysteriously as a result of Cardiac Arres=
t.

Since my husbands death, my family has been under restriction of movement=

and that not withstanding, we are being molested, policed and our bank ac=
count
both here and abroad are being frozen by the Nigerian government. All thi=
s
is because the present Nigerian President was put in prison by my husband=

when he was found guilty of plotting a coup to over-throw my husband. All=

my husband friends refuse to come to our aid because of fear of the Presi=
dent
and for governmental positions which he had offered them.

Following the recent discovery of my husbands Bank Account by the Nigeria=
n
government with Swiss Bank in which the huge sum of US$700 Million and DM=
450
Million was logged. I therefore decided to contact you in confidence that=

l was able to move out the sum of US$30.8 Million Dollars, which was secr=
etly
sealed in Two Metal Boxes for Security Reasons and was deposited with a s=
afe
Deposit Company outside Nigeria through their diplomatic service for safe=

Keeping.

Please you can visit these websites and read more about my late husband a=
nd
you will understand what I am telling you.

www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=3D42764&SelectRegion=3DWest_Africa

I personally appeal to you seriously and religiously for your urgent assi=
stance
to move this money into your country where l believe It will be safe sinc=
e
l cannot leave the country due
to the restriction of movement imposed on the members of my family by the=

Nigeria Government.

I have made necessary arrangement with an Attorney who will arrange all t=
he
documents that covers this consignment, you will have to met with him the=

security company were this consignment will be release to you, and liaise=

with you towards effective completion of this money out of the country. O=
nce
you indicate your interest towards assisting us, I will direct you to the=

Attorney who shall send you the contact information of the company togeth=
er
with secret code of the consignment and other related documents that will=

help you claim the consignment.

Conclusively, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the total sum while 75%
is to be held on trust by you until we regain our freedom from the Nigeri=
an
Government and 5% for any expenses that you will make during this transac=
tion.
Also we have decided to establish a mutual business investments with our
own share in your country in which you will monitor on our behalf subsequ=
ent
to our free movement by the Nigerian government.

Please kindly reply to this email address urgently and treat this transac=
tion
with absolute confidentiality and sincerity.

Best Regards.
MRS.MARIAM ABACHA
