FROM:MS.SARAH ROBERTS
575 Finchley Road
London NW3 7BJ,U.K.
UNITED KINGDOM.

PROPOSITION:

My name is Sarah Roberts. I am a friend and a personal councellor to a former credit manager and then the account officer of a foreigner named Gerard St.Germain who died in an air crash along with his wife on the 31st October 2001 in an Egyptian airline 990,with other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below.

http://www.cnn.com/US/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html

My friend resigned from the bank months ago because of internal family problems,but before his resignaton he was managing the deposit account of the late Gerard St Germain were he had access to some vital information as to how the funds will be paid to the next of kin. Since his death, none of his next-of-kin is alive to make claims for this money as his heir,because they all died in the same accident, him and the wife, Yvette St.Germain (May their soul rest in peace). The bank cannot release the funds from his account unless someone applies for the claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in their banking guidelines. Upon this discovery, my friend asked me to look for a reliable person to stand as the next of kin because he can not handle this directly since he has worked in the bank, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked out by me and my friend for the funds valued
(US$15,000,000.00) to be released in your favour as the beneficiary's next of kin. After four years the bank is permitted by law of UK to send the money to the treasury as unclaimed bills and the money shared amongst the directors of the bank.

It is on this basis,that my friend asked me to seek for whom shall be used as the next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to share this money amongst themselves at the end of the year.

Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance to this noble offer by furnishing me with the following information if you are interested. 1.A Beneficiary name and address in order for me to to get a probate for the transfer of the funds in your name. 2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers.For our personal contact and mutual discussion.

Upon your acceptance, I shall give you my direct telephone number so that we can discuss freely.We shall be compensating you with four million dollars(US$4Million Dollars) on final conclusion of this project for your assistance,US$1Million Dollars shall be for any unforssen expenses,while the remaining US$10 Million will be shared between me and my friend.

If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to contact me immediately,if not please disregard this email.

Regards,
Ms.Sarah Roberts
