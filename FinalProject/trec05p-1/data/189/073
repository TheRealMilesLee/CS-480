MARKET NOTICE
January 7, 2002
New CAISO Energy Management System (EMS) Cutover
ISO Market Participants: 
On Sunday, December 30, 2001, the California ISO cutover its grid operations
to a new Energy Management System (EMS).  The EMS is a computer-based system
used to monitor the real-time performance of the various elements of an
electric system, and to control generation and manage transmission
facilities. The system monitors electric transmission grid status, energy
flowing from power plants, adjusts the output of plants in response to
changes in power demand on the Grid, communicates with ISO scheduling
systems and reports on plant outages.
The implementation and final cutover of the new EMS into production was the
culmination of a year-long effort of the CAISO, in partnership with ABB
Network Management of Houston, Texas, to replace the previous CAISO Energy
Management System.
