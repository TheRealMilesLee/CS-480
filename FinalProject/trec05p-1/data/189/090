Need Michelle to help categorise under headings I suggested. Michelle, if you agree with my analysis can I ask Kari just to resort these so I can give to Lavo tomorrow in that format?
 
Clearly, the below is useful, but what Lavo asked was, which ENA contracts do we really have little chance of enforcing or are in danger of defaulting under. As such while we know per below that some of attached we haven't delivered on, I want to make sure we give him an indication of whether that it itself mean we have no argument to enforce.
