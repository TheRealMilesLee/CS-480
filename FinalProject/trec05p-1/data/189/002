WOW!  I'm sure you're not having any pre-marital #$%!^ as to save that "special moment" until after the ceremony.

Dear Friends! 

I hope you all had a wonderful Christmas holiday...it went by fast and 
it's always a crazy time.  The kids had a blast with all of their new 
gifts and gadgets that required frequent battery installation so the 
house has been busy...and noisy.  (what kind of relative would buy the 
noisiest toys in the store?!) 

The best part of our holiday is that I became engaged on Christmas Eve. 
It was a wonderfully planned proposal and I received a beautiful 
engagement ring. The fellows' name is Brad Bailor and he is a wonderful 
man .  We are very happy and plan a wedding sometime in July. 

I just couldn't wait to share our news! 

I hope all is well with all of you and Happy New Year! 

Love, Lisa
