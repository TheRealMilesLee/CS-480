Mackenzie Delta Natural Gas Project Files for Approval

  

   A consortium of major oil companies have moved closer to 

developing almost 6 Tcf of natural gas in the Mackenzie Delta region 

on the coast of the Beaufort Sea. The group has begun the lengthy 

process of applying for regulatory approval, which could take up to 4 

years. Led by Imperial Oil, the group consists of Conoco, Shell 

Canada, Exxon Mobil and now includes a company controlled by 

Northwest Territories native people. The partners, known as the 

Mackenzie Valley Producers Group, could spend up to C$250 million 

before they decide whether to proceed with the project. The natural 

gas reserves would be produced from Imperial's 3 Tcf Taglu field, the 

1.8 Tcf Parsons Lake field, owned by Conoco and Exxon Mobil, and 

Shell's 1 Tcf Niglintgak field. The project would include a pipeline 

to carry up to 1 Bcf per day of natural gas to Alberta along the 

Mackenzie River valley at a estimated cost of C$3 billion. The 

natural gas would then be transported to Canada and the US. Last 

year, the group signed an agreement with Northwest Territories native 

leaders that would give the region's people a 33% share in the 

pipeline and provide other economic benefits. Even if the Mackenzie 

Delta project did not start pumping for 5 or 6 years, it likely will 

still be ahead of the Alaskan project, where BP, Exxon Mobil and 

Phillips are planning development of their reserves.
