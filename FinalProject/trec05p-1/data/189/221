Sounds good.  Probably less than 5 VP's.

OK. I know that!
 
I wasn't planning to "promote" all the Managers to Director however. Just retitle them, leave their salaries as is. If we want to give them all bumps to $115 (from $95), then I'll start water dropping that.
 
I was assuming you wanted 2 or 3 new MD's, 5 or 10 new VP's and probably 50 or 60 other incidental changes on the support side between Specialists and Snr Directors (presuming we don't do away with titles for support folks).
