Mike - you are correct.  Most of the OTR's SIPs have already been approved by the USEPA - with a start date of 2003.   (so final versions are available if you need them).  Please give me a call if you want to talk through these issues further.

Mary,

Just checking.  The OTR will role into the SIP CALL in 2003?  I know SEC 126 has changed, but wanted to check with OTR.
