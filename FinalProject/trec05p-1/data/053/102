FROM; BONGA WEMBA
JOHANNESBURGH
REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA
MOBILE NO. 27-83-76-44403


Attn: MD/CEO

                                        Attn: Request For Assistance

You may be surprise to receive this letter from me, since you don't  know me 
personally, I am MR JOHNSON WEMBA the first son of MOYO BONGA WEMBA who was 
recently murdered in a land dispute in Zimbabwe.

I am writing this letter to request your assistance and confidentiality to 
handle a transfer of fund into a Foreign account and I decided to write you. 
My late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in 
cold blood by the agents of the ruling Government of President Robert 
Mugabe, for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean
opposition party controlled by the white minority.

Before my fathers death, he has taken his fund to Europe and deposited the 
sum of fifteen Million
United State Dollars ($15 million)with a Security and Finance Company as if 
he foresaw the looming
danger in Zimbabwe. This money was allocated for the purchase of new 
Machinery and chemical products for Agro allied farm and for the 
establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.

This land dispute arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land 
act that wholly affected the rich white farmers, and the blacks vehemently 
condemned the "modsoperandi" adopted by the government. This resulted to 
rampant Killings and mob actions by the war veterans and some political 
thugs,precisely more than three thousands(3,000)people have so far been
killed.Heads of government from the west, especially Britain and United 
States have
voiced their condemnation of Mugabe's plans.

Subsequently, South Africa Development Community (S.A.D.C) has continuously 
supported Mugabe's new land act, it is against this background that my 
entire family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to 
transfer my father's money into a foreign account.

As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of 
seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred 
without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our 
family's wealth and South Africa government seem to be playing along
with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South 
Africa for the fear of encountering the same experience in the future,since 
both countries have the same political history.

More so, The South Africa Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such 
investment, Hence I am seeking for political asylum in The Netherlands. As a 
business person, I want to entrust my future and that of my family into your 
hands, I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free and the 
nature of your business does not necessarily matter.

For your assistance,we are offering you 20% of the sum, 75% for me and my 
family, while 5% will be mapped out for any expenses that we may incure 
during this transaction.We wish to invest our money on commercial properties 
based on your advice.Finally,i will demand for a total assurance and
sincerity on your part when the fund gets to the account you are going to 
provide in your country or elsewhere.If this proposal is accepted by you, 
please confirm by sending me an email with this email address 
(johnsonwemba001@hotmail.com).

Thanks and God bless you. Awaiting your urgent response.

Kind Regards ,

Mr. Johnson Wemba .
