if heat exhaust is counted in the "renewable" category, this would be another opportunity to take waste heat at TW compressor stations and convert it to electricity at above market rates.  We are looking at one of these opportunties at TW station 1.

Kevin,

FYI--The New Mexico PRC has issued a proposed Renewable Energy Rule which would require providers of electricity to increase the percentage of their portfolio of energy supply from renewable sources.  Please review and let me know if this is something you feel we need to comment on.  My opinion would be that even if it impacted our business, it would be hard to argue against renewable sources of energy.  Below is the link to the proposed rule.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Glen
