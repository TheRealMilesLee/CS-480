Texans, Titans whatever. They still will suck as bad as the Astros and the
Rockets. I will say though Texas is a good state to watch college football.

Trailblazer's looking good lately, too.

Back to business.
Can you trade in the Robert Badeer account or are you restricted to only
trading corporate funds?

Abuse to later

Monaco,
	Traders speculate, pure and simple. At least that what I do. The new
team in Houston is the Texans. I don't really care who they are. The knicks
stink. Talk to you soon.

Good, you can go from one wet loser state, to a dry hot loser state.

Good luck trading gas. After eating Taco Bell, I usually make enough to
power all of Long Island for a month.

How does a trader earn their keep? you get a commission selling to another
firm or speculate on price movements and take a position?

Let me know when you are in NY, so I can ensure that I am away. 


Good luck in Houston, go Titans!!

Monaco,
	Whats up with you? Great SuperBowl. I hate the Rams, so glad they
lost. I'm going down to Houston to work for UBS on the gas trading desk. New
commodity for me, should be fun. Looking to get back to NY at some point in
the future. I know you'll still be there, stinking up the joint. Anyway,
will let you know how things go. Talk to you soon.
