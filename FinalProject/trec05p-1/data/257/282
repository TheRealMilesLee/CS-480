Dominion's lawyer left me a message that they are sticking with the termination.  I will send them a letter telling them that we will be covering.

Mark Ellenberg is off for Passover.  We can discuss options early next week.  I have beed in contact with him, and he is familiar with the issues.

The contract is a bit complicated.  I will prepare a contract summary along the lines of what Pete prepared for MCV.
