I am not sure what you  are asking, but we run this report everyday for the east and west performance books and there is always liquidations.  Today (for 3-26-2002) we are only able to see liquidations for the east book and I am certain there are liquidations for the west book also.

The last schedule strip for that desk has ToDate  3/24/2002.
Was WEST and that desk scheduled ?

Do you have an estimate of when we can run the PSCNA for West?  (East ran with information, it was just west that was a problem.)  We need to send out our reports that include that information in the next hour.

Thanks,
Laurel
