DEAR FRIEND,

 I AM MR KEN OMAN THE AUDIT MANAGER OF FIRST ATLANTIC MARCHANT BANK 
OF GHANA IN WEST AFRICA THERE IS AN OPEN ACCOUNT IN THIS BANK IN 1980 
ANDSINCE NOBODY HAS OPERATED ON THIS ACCOUNT AGAIN.
AFTER GOING THROUGH SOME OLD FILES IN THE RECORDS I DISCOVERED THAT IF
I DO NOT REMITT THIS MONEY OUT URGENTELY IT WIL FORFEITED FOR NOTHING.

THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT MR PAUL PHILLIP.A FORIGNER AND THE MANAGER
OF PETROL CHEMICAL SERVICE,A LECTRICAL ENGINEER BY PROFFESSION AND HE
DIED SINCE 1990. NO OTHER PERSON KNOWS ABOUT THIS ACCOUNT OR ANYTHING
CONCERNING IT, THE ACCOUNT HAS NO OTHER BENEFICIARY AND MY
INVESTIGATION PROVED TO ME AS WELL THAT HIS COMPANY DOES NOT KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ACCOUNT AND THE AMOUNT INVLOVED IS
U.S.$10.500,000.00(TEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUASAND DOLLARS).

I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A SAFE FORIGN ACOUNT ABROAD BUT I
DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER, I AM ONLY CONTACTING YOU AS A FOREIGNER
BECAUSE THIS MONEY CAN NOT BE APPROVED TO ANY LOCAL BANK HERE BUT CAN
ONLY BE APPROVED TO ANY FOREIGN ACCOUNT BECAUSE THE MONEY IS U.S
DOLLARS AND THE FORMER OWNER OF THE ACCOUNT IS MR HENSON DAVID AND HE
WAS A FOREIGNER TOO.

I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE WILL COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE AS WE DON'T
KNOW OUR SELF BEFORE,BUT BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE
BUSINESS. I ONLY GOT YOUR CONTACTFROM OUR CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE
RESEARCH WITH BELIEVE IN GOD THAT YOU WILL NEVER LET ME DOWN IN THIS
BUSINESS,YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON THAT I HAVE CONTACTED FOR THIS
BUSINESS FOR NOW SOPLEASE REPLY URGENTLY.

WHEN THE TRANSFER IS APPROVED AND PAYMENT SCHEDULE I WILL PROVIDE YOU
AN ACCOUNT ON WHERE YOU WILL TRANSFER MY OWN PERCENTAGE IN THE DEAL,I
WILL USE MY POSITION IN THE OFFICE TO PROVIDE ALL THE NECESSARY
INFORMATION FOR THE APPROVAL OF THIS FUND.I WILL COME DOWN TO YOUR
COUNTRY FOR THE SHARING AND OTHER INVESTMENT.

AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS BUSINESS,YOU WILL BE GIVEN 35% OF THE TOTAL
AMOUNT, 60% WILL BE FOR ME, WHILE 5% WILL BE FOR EXPENSES , BOTH
PARTIES MIGHT HAVE INCURED DURING THE PROCESS OF TRANSACTION.I LOOK 
FORWARD TO YOUR EARLIEST REPLY THROUGH THIS PRIVATE
