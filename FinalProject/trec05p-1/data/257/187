NEWS:

LONDON (Reuters) -- March 31, 2OO5 -- Oil markets have entered a 
``super-spike'' period that could see 197O's-style price surges as high as 
$1O5 a barrel, investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a research report.

Goldman's Global Investment Research note also raised the bank's 2005 
and 2006 New York Mercantile Exchange crude price forecasts to $5O and 
$55 respectively, from $41 and $4O.

These forecasts sit at the top of a table of predictions from 25 
analysts, consultants and government bodies surveyed by Reuters.

``We believe oil markets may have entered the early stages of what we 
have referred to as a ``super spike'' period -- a multi-year trading 
band of oil prices high enough to meaningfully reduce energy consumption 
and recreate a spare capacity cushion only after which will lower energy 
prices return,'' Goldman's analysts wrote.

BNP Petroleum Corporation, Inc. is an Irving based oil and gas 
exploration and development (E&D) company. BNP Petroleum Corporation, Inc. was 
formed for the purpose of development and operation of oil and gas 
properties with proven reserves. The Company's strategy is to focus in 
domestic areas where major oil and gas producing companies have reduced 
their exploration efforts to move offshore and overseas in search of the 
larger reserves. Considerable oil and gas in proven fields remain to be 
exploited by well-managed independent oil companies capable of 
extracting these reserves at lower risk and lower cost than unproved prospects. 
BNP Petroleum's initial development strategy has been to acquire such 
proven fields and increase production through the application of 
advanced technology and the exploration of other proven formations in the same 
fields.  

BNP Petroleum Corporation's primary operational strategy includes the 
operation of its own projects, giving it substantial control over 
drilling and production costs. The Company has associated with highly 
experienced exploration and development engineering and geology personnel that 
strive to add production at lower costs through development drilling, 
workovers, behind pipe recompletions and secondary recovery operations. 

The Company's long-term strategy is to build an oil and gas production 
company through a strategic combination of selected property 
acquisitions and an exploration program. Additionally, the Company will continue 
to rework existing wells in an attempt to increase production and 
reserves.

IRVING, Texas, May 25, 2O05 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- BNP Petroleum 
Corporation (OTC Pink Sheets: BPET - News; BPET), an independent oil and 
gas company, announced today restarting of "Hooks" lease located in 
Wichita county Texas, after accomplishing modifications and upgrades on 
some wells, in the last few months. The shallow wells previously had been 
producing oil and water at low rates due to low bottom pressure, which 
is normal for the area. Steadily increasing rates of production for 
Hooks lease are expected.

BNP Director, Rafael Pinedo said today, "BNP Petroleum will begin 
immediately to restart other leases in our portfolio of properties and 
complete all necessary work to assure that BNP's properties are in full 
compliance with the regulations of the Texas Railroad Commission and re- 
establish oil production on BNP's leases over the coming months."
