MR.JOSEPH YUN
CHINA MERCHANT BANK.
DES BOUEX RD. BRANCH,
CENTRAL HONG KONG,
HONK KONG.
Email:josephyun_co_cmb@yahoo.com.hk

Dear Friend,

I am Mr.Joseph Yun, credit officer of the China Merchant Bank. I have a concealed business suggestion for you.
 
Before the U.S and Iraqi war, our client Gen.Talfik Kubu who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Forty Three Million, Six Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.
 
Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even during the war. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.
 
After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen.Talfik Kubu did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no One except me knew of his deposit in my bank.
 
So, Forty Three Million,Six Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it.What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration three years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.
 
Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen.Talfik Kubu so that you will be able to receive his funds.
 
WHAT IS TO BE DONE:
 
I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen.Talfik Kubu ,all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job.
 
After you have been made the next of kin,the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.
 
There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents.Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.
 
Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5%for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation.
 
Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication, you can write me via my private box thus:(josephyun_co_cmb@yahoo.com.hk) and i will provide you with more details of this operation.
 
Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.
 
Kind Regards,
 
Mr.Joseph Yun
