Hi Shelley:
I am looking forward to seeing you and Alina tomorrow for the shower.  It 
will be great to have the opportunity to visit with you.
Just so you know, Laura and Kathryn will be here tomorrow and can help 
entertain Alina if needed.
There are several people that I have not heard from as far as RSVP's.  We 
will have plenty of food, so if anyone asks you, please tell them just to 
come!
Take care,
Barbara
P.S.  By the way, if you have any pictures or mementos from your trip that 
you might like to share, bring them along.
