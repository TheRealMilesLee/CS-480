IN THE NEWS...
Medicare Funds Nutritional Therapy
On January 1, 2002, Medicare began covering medical nutritional therapy for many recipients with diabetes and kidney diseases. With this new benefit, around 4.5 million Medicare recipients with diabetes and an estimated 110,000 with kidney disease are eligible for medical nutritional therapy aimed at helping them learn to make healthy eating choices and better manage their conditions.  The comments of Anne Daly, the Association's President, Health Care & Education, are featured in this article from The Washington Post covering the new benefit.

FDA Approves Generic Metformin
The US Food and Drug Administration recently granted approval to eleven generic drug manufacturers to market generic versions of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's popular diabetes medication Glucophage (metformin).  Glucophage is taken orally in pill form, and is currently the world's top-selling diabetes medication. The drug reduces blood sugar levels by curbing production of glucose by the liver.

Sexual Problems in Men With Diabetes, and More from Diabetes Care
According to a study published in the February issue of Diabetes Care, the Association's journal of clinical research, more than one-third of adult men with diabetes experience sexual dysfunction.  Also in the February issue, a separate study shows that a particular type of weight-loss surgery can dramatically improve the health of severely obese people with diabetes, and in some cases even send the disease into remission.
