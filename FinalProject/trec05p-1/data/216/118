He was not offered a job in UBS.  He was told last Friday, by me, that he would remain in the Estate, so his resignation is from the Estate.

I believe he is a UBS employee.   Jeanie, are you guys handling any terminations yet for these folks or do you want us to process? 
Thanks, 
H

Stacey,

I'd like to notify you that tomorrow, January 31st, 2002 will be my last day at Enron.  I am resigning to pursue another career opportunity.  It has been good working with you, and I wish you and your team all the best.

Tim Carter
