looks like we need to have a co-ordinated effort because i think val may be having people over too.  i am indifferent as to where the party is held, but would like a consensus.  you guys should probably talk about it.

right now i guess we have 6 - i have not heard back from boone.  val said he would stop by if they were back in town by then.  i didn't have mitch's e-mail so you may want to forward to him and i will talk to hull.

i guess we could have about 10 people.

what do you think?
