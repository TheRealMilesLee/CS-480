Scouting Report Special Edition---Where technology hits home. 

Tuesday, September 18, a worm named Nimda, which targeted Windows-based servers and computers struck domestically, shutting down sites everywhere. Companies, businesses and PC owners were suddenly finding themselves scrambling to get their computers cleaned out and back up and running. The truth is, most people do not back up their computer files. It may cross their minds once in awhile, but few actually act on it. Is it because backing up files is such an all-consuming task, or is it because we really are just that lazy? Here at TechnoScout, we are giving you yet another reason to save your files, or risk losing important documentation. Find out how easy it can be: 
  _____  

Because we live in a world of viruses, back up your hard drive RIGHT NOW!

With the Pockey Portable Drive, up to 20 GB of files are easy to store and carry - and even easier to afford.

The Pockey Portable Drive is small enough to fit in your shirt pocket, plugs into (and is powered by) your computers USB port, and delivers more capacity for the money than any other similar device. Up to 20 GB of storage, at a cost that is far less than other devices! Save files from your desktop computer in your Pockey drive and take them to business meetings along with your laptop. Even data-rich files like sales presentations, engineering drawings, spreadsheets, and customer databases are no problem. And by accessing files from your Pockey drive, you keep your notebook free of data you do not need to store. Maybe you do not have the problems of a road warrior, but you want an external drive to store and carry digital photos, mp3 files, or even games and movies. Again, Pockey is the answer.
