Jeremy --

To let you know where we stand on the CPUC's Investigation on DA Suspension.  

1.	Sue Mara is leading the effort to respond to the CPUC for Enron.

2.	We knew that the CPUC was at a minimum going to investigate how and/or whether to allow extensions of contracts and the application of other surcharge $$ to DA load given their earlier statements.  The issue on retroactivity is open primarily because they can ask these questions and (I believe) as leverage for other issues.

3.	We are coordinating with the big customers who recently left.  They are marshalling forces to oppose any retroactivity.  This is as much their fight as it is ours.

4.	At this time, Enron will file as a member of AReM.  We intend to oppose the CPUC's request for our contracts and transaction information.

If you want any other info or want to discuss further, let me know.

Jim
