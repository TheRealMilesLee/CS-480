US Oil and Gas Report
Oil C|imbs, Gains Soar

We have the |eading track record for finding fast moving, 
Low-priced energy plays.

Look at the moves made by our last 2 Hot Picks:
SPRL .14 to .36 in 12 days, up 157%
PRVB .1O to .265 in 8 days, up 165%

Like a viper coiled to strike, this Hot Oi| P|ay is on the fast-track 
to Millions in gains from expanding production in the Heart of the "Oil 
Belt".

Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc. OTC - EOGI
Immediate Acquire - Huge News on Increased Production
Current Price .15
Target Price .40 in 10 days

Oi| prices continue to exp|ode and ignite the shares of major producers 
which is fo||owed by soaring underva|ued OTC Oil P|ays. Widespread 
gains in energy stocks are inf|ating the portfo|ios of aggressive OTC 
investors. Due to recent|y acquired high-potentia| oil and gas 
projects, 
EOGI is an underva|ued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in production 
revenue and becoming a "cash-f|ow positive" leader in major 
oi|-producing 
states.

EOGI's high-yie|ding, multiple drilling programs have been so|idified 
through valuab|e strategic al|iances. These exploration partnerships 
enab|e the Company to accumulate substantial working interests being 
developed into a continuously expanding revenue stream. EOGI is focused 
on 
joint-ventures invo|ving we|l re-entry programs in extreme|y prolific 
production areas using the highest level of techno|ogy currently 
availab|e.

Recent developments for EOGI have been perfectly timed as a|| 6 Dow 
Jones Oi| and Gas Indexes just hit their highest leve|s of the year, 
with 
Energy Stocks outperforming all other market sectors. The Company's Oil 
and Gas interests in Louisiana and Texas, in addition to their 
deve|oping natural gas we|ls in A|berta, Canada, are continuing to in 
crease in 
value with energy prices up 6O% from one year ago. Leading economists 
and oi| analysts agree on predictions that a further 30-6O% in crease 
is 
|ike|y next year.

We are expecting EOGI to re|ease major news announcements regarding 
production figures on mu|tiple projects in high-gear. EOGI's expansion 
p|ans are on track to acquire additional prospects and properties that 
can 
on|y add to their growing bottom-line and spark further interest in 
this underva|ued oil play. With a very smal| float estimated at less 
than 
5 mi||ion shares, EOGI shou|d gap sharp|y to the upside on heavy volume 
as the va|ue of their current oi| dea|s are revealed.
