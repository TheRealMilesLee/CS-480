Shel,  Everything ok except enron has credible attack threat.  Cops all in our two buildings , Mike said had bomb dogs in gas control. Many , many cops outside our buildings and in garage.  Called Linda Laferla at home for a comp day to access our system and monitor just in case. I'm sure you have already heard all about it.  Maybe we need to talk to our bunch about it.
