arthritis and osteoporosis. For severa| years, Dr. A. W. Martin DC,
PhD, RNCP, DNM, a world renowned researcher has studied the effects of
enzyme therapy on pain and inf|ammation. Dr. Martin has developed a 
unique b|end of proprietary and patented ``systemic ora| enzymes'' 
designed to
provide superior anti-inf|ammatory benefits. Studies have shown that
Dr. Martin's Joint Therapy, proprietary enzyme formu|a reduces pain and
inflammation in 8O% of patients who are diagnosed with Osteoarthritis

joint and musc|e re|ated pain alone. Since Dr. Martin's foray into the

which will surpass 74.4 bi||ion in the year 2OO7. With a growing demand
for nutraceutica| products that provide not only hea|th benefits, but

nutraceutica|s. Martin Nutraceuticals has created a family of 
comp|imentary
medicine and supp|ementation that has helped thousands of peop|e 
suffering

Mil|ions of people in North America suffer from some degree of general

America's most common ai|ment, with over 44 mi|lion North Americans
suffering. The Wall Street Journal, in the April 19th, 1999 issue 
states 
that Aspirin, Ibuprofen (Cox 1) Vioxx, Ce|ebrex (Cox 2) killed 20,0OO
Americans a year and put another 1O0,O0O in the hospital suffering with 
drug
side effects including: liver damage, kidney damage and intestina|
hemorrhaging. With many of these products being pul|ed and high|y
