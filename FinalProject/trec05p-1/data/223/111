Kevin,
 
I know things are still pretty dynamic in the new organization, but I am hoping I can speak with you about the possibility of any remaining power trading positions you might be looking to fill.  I know that several people were not retained in the NE, and my past Enron experience makes me a good candidate to fill a trading role there.  I don't know if you remember me from before, but I spent time in Structuring as the lead Structurer for the UI deal, then Jim brought me over to work with Bill Reed and John Suarez on trading and marketing around the UI position in NEPOOL as well as PJM and NY (which had not really started trading at the time).  You and I never really had a chance to interact as we had no peaker assets in the regions in which I worked.  After EPMI I went to EBS, and most recently Jim asked me to go to Singapore as the head of the trading and risk management function for our Asia positions.  Currently I am working in the estate managing the terminated power book for Racicot.
 
In early November, when it was only EBS that was on its way to shutting down, I was in discussions with Dana about re-joining the EPMI team.  It sounded as if there was a definite need and Dana seemed eager to bring me back on the team.  I realize everything has changed since then, though I am still hoping I can fill a need.  I have been attempting to sit down with Dana to identify current and near term needs, but we have yet to meet up.  I want to make sure that some random timing issue doesn't negatively impact my prospects of securing a spot, so I am hoping that now maybe I can discuss with you any opportunities.  If there are not opportunities, then that is valuable feedback as well so that I can appropriately direct my job search post-estate.  I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Regards,
Fred Cohagan
Director, EWS
