Michelle,  Correct me on this one if I am wrong...

In the body of the email distributed yesterday afternoon it says that the form should be sent to Linda Guinn.  I believe she is in the legal department for Enron.  So I would assume she is the person who will track and report on who has and has not submitted their certification letter.

OK

Who is the individual responsible for making sure that 600 plus people will read the 9 pages of protocol and will also verify and collect a signed certification from every new UBS employee by this Friday?  Who will collect Enron's copy of these and hold them and is someone coordinating with UBS directly?
