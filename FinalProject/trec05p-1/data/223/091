Fletch-

We are moving all relevant Risk Management files over to the new environment, but will not be doing anything with specific files used only by the trading group.  If any of you had an templates or files that you used to follow your positions or estimate your curve shift outside of the Curve Manager, you will need to identify and move those (or possibly have your analysts move them?).

Let me know if you have any questions about specific Risk related files you would like to ensure are being moved.

Thanks-

Andrea

Casey,

Are you guys going to be responsible for moving all relevant power files from the O: and M: drives to UBS?  If so, thanks.  If not, who is?  Thanks,

Fletch
