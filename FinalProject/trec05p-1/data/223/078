TOP STORY: WHITE HOUSE FLOATS PLAN TO CUT CO2 EMISSIONS
The White House released an outline for cutting carbon dioxide emissions 
yesterday supporting technology and incentives instead of the world-wide 
emissions trading system as proposed in the Kyoto Protocol.  Although 
President Bush has not settled on details, the report on the economy, 
published by the White House, replaces setting fixed targets with 
emission-intensity targets that would expand or contract with economic 
growth. This system would grant the United States easier targets as long as 
economic growth continues to exceed emission growth, the report suggests.
