In cooperation with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory

and metrics of selling green power.

This is a how-to conference designed for green power program
managers to answer questions like:

- What's our score on the Green Power Index?
- How do I maximize the value of the market research I can
afford?
- Fuzzy critters, kids, windmills - what sells green power?
- Direct mail, PR, how do I reach the customers who want
green power?

Register today at http://www.xenergy.com/denver and join
your colleagues from around the globe to learn the specifics
of benchmarking green power programs, buying and using
market research, selecting sales channels and developing
message strategies and critiquing creative.  You'll leave
with a framework for marketing green power as well as tools
and tactics for selling and measuring your success.

Our featured lunch speaker February 20th will be Will Toor,
the Mayor of Boulder and Director of the University of
Colorado Student Union Environmental Center.  Mayor Toor
will speak about how each of these institutions decided to
choose green power and how green programs can best approach
these customers.

Your conference leader will be XENERGY Vice President, Julie
Blunden, a founder and former Western Regional President of
Green Mountain Energy Company.  Please click on the linked
invitation for the agenda as well as registration and hotel
