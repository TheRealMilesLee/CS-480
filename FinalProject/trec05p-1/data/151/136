I'm sorry to say that we won't be able to have our holiday party as planned
on the 16th of December.  I apologize for having asked you to save the
date, but I guess, on the bright side, you can look forward to at least one
peaceful night in the midst of the many, many parties that will take place
this holiday season.

I know that we'll re-visit our giving party in the future, but we'll miss
having the opportunity to celebrate with you this year.  Have a wonderful
holiday season!

Ann

ps.  We still plan on helping a family in need this Christmas.  If you'd
like to join us in giving, let me know via email.  I'll have a list of
things needed by the family on Friday, Nov 30th.  Thanks.
