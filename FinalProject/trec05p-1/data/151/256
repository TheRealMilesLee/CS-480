I am sure you all will be reviewing the appropriateness of the numbers, but am am very curious about the $1 miilion or so for the Kern interconnect. Why should we have to pay for that one?

Steve,
You will be interested in the proposed budget for PG&E's gas quality issue for 2002.  Not unexpected.  John
