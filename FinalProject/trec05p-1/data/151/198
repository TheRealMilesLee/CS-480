IMPORTANT TIPS TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS AT Match.com: 

If you use the "reply" button to respond to this message, please take the following steps:

1.  DELETE ALL TEXT from the body of your message, including header information which may include your actual email address.

2.  REMOVE ANY AUTOMATIC SIGNATURES which may include your personal contact information.

Our anonymous re-mailer will strip away your real email address (in the From: field), so that it will NOT appear in the "From:" line. However, DO NOT use the "Cc:" or "Bcc:" fields as these addresses CANNOT be stripped away.

You may also contact this person from their Match.com profile by clicking "Contact this person" and composing your message directly from the site. 

Match.com does not monitor private email between members, nor are we liable for the content of these messages. All members are bound by our Match.com Service Agreement.
