Ray,

Tim reiterated in a call today that he would like to get briefed on the litigation and also would like any intelligence on when FERC's going to revise the WSCC-wide cap.

Regarding the latter, I assume we keep the radar up for an order from the FERC.  I expect it any day now.

Regarding the former, can you set up a meeting either late this week or early next?

Alan

Ray --

Let' s hold a call in early Dec (I don't need to be on the call) where we go through the FERC case for Belden.  Give me a call to discuss.
