David,
I run a $650 million dollar commodities fund at Harvard Management Company.  Our focus has been on arbitrage strategies in the commodity arena - we are looking to expand into weather and power. I was wondering, if given the potential situation at Enron, that there might be employees interested in interviewing for several positions both within my group and foreign equities ? I apologize if this is too forward or that I have assumed too much in terms of potential restructurings.
Thanks,

Stuart D. Porter
