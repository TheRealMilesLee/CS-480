Good choice.  The auth # is 252134-2.  I have communicated that to Olivia.  That is for the first six visits.  Additional ones will be requested directly by Olivia.  There is a $20. co-pay per visit.  Jim

All are seasoned clinicians.  I've had good reports from persons that have been to see them.  If the arrangment works well for you here, let me know.  In any event the sessions from this point carry a $20 co-pay.  Insurance picks up the rest.  Let me know who you schedule an appointment with and I will get the authorization for the first 6  visits.  Subsequent visits will be authorized by the provider.

Jim,

Just wondering if you had that list of counselors or if you were interested in setting something up.
