I sent you this about a month ago but I did not hear back from you and I wanted to followup. I have attached my original email below:

I was looking around the Internet for helpful resources and came across your website. I thought it would make sense to exchange links with your site. My website is a tremendous resource for information on arthritis, glucosamine and joint pain. This informative site doesn't sell anything but instead seeks to educate the public about arthritis and describe just how things like COX-2 drugs can be fatal. There are literally hundreds of articles, clinical research, a discussion forum and simple explanations of scientific findings to explore. Let me know when you have placed your link and I will put yours up in the category of your choice within 24 hours. To save you some time, I have created a sample link and included the HTML code below:

Thousands of visitors a day trust the Glucosamine and Arthritis Center to provide timely information on <a href="http://www.glucosamine-arthritis.org">joint pain and arthritis</a>. If you or a loved one has a question about anything related to joint health, you owe it to yourself to explore this helpful, free resource today. 


In Health,

P.S. If this ended up at the wrong person, please accept my sincerest apologies. If you could forward this to the correct person I would greatly appreciate it. Lastly, if you do not wish for me to follow up with you, please let me know and I will not bother you about this again.
