Dear Martin,

This is a reminder that the final survey for the NewPower energy management pilot is available online at: 

http://www.survey66.com/scripts/r4tn35.exe?System__IDNO=web/newpow5-390&_p=mar390

If you cannot access the survey through the link above, you may manually enter the address, your ID number and your password.  Use the information below...

http://www.survey66.com/newpow5.htm

USER ID = WEB\NEWPOW5- 390
PASSWORD =  mar390

As a reminder, we are contacting you again on behalf of NewPower, the energy service company that is conducting the energy management pilot, to gain more of your opinions about the energy products installed in your home. This is the final survey you will be asked to take about the pilot.  It asks a variety of questions about the devices and your satisfaction with them and the pilot. The survey will take between 15 and 20 minutes to complete. In exchange for your time (after completing the survey) you will receive $20.

Thank you in advance for your help with the research portion of the pilot!

Zanthus
