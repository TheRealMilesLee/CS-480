Hey Guys,

As you know I've moved over to URM, but I have some fond memories from real-time.  It's been a pleasure working with everyone. I'm on the next row, so if you need anything give me a shout.

Good luck and stay crazy,

David.

Group,

David Porter will be moving to the Utility Risk Management group with Enron Energy Services beginning Tuesday October 23. Please join me in thanking David for his effort in the real-time group over the past year (especially the 24-hour long shift), and wishing him good luck in his new position.

Stay tuned for a "going away" party for Dave in the near future.

Bill
