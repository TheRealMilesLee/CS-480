Tana -

When you have the ETA amendment letter ready for TECO to see, could you please e-mail it to Pat Castoro at TECO (pacastoro@tecoenergy.com) and also forward a copy to their counsel - Brian Harms (brian.harms@troutmansanders.com).

The legal name  that needs to be on this letter is TECO EnergySource, Inc.  There will also be a second letter amendment for a partnership that is being formed by TECO under the name TECO-Panda Generating Company, LP.

Thanks.

Mark
