All testing was performed, and was successful except for the following:
although ENW Resolution Center confirmed that Exchange servers are up, they have received reports that some people get a login screen when trying to access their Outlook.  They are instructing their users to cancel by the message.  We have not observed this problem in ETS.
while attempting to access the Flow Gas application, we were unable to hit www.infosource.com.  We paged the Business Objects on-call pager and will continue to follow up.
