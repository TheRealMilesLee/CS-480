Houston Technology Center is proud to co-sponsor technitude 2001, an event
designed to encourage middle school girls to stay interested in math,
science and technology and select the classes they will need to pursue
technical degrees. The event provides a fun and interactive experience where
girls take on team roles and collaborate to solve challenges their
communities are facing. Engaging their diverse skill sets, levels of
knowledge and life experiences naturally produces an environment where
exciting and creative results can grow. As the girls their apply math,
science and technology skills in concrete ways, they can begin to see the
relevance of these foundational skills and their critical importance to the
roles they will play in the future.

The girls will work in teams of seven, each with a mentor (a professional
woman holds a math, science or technology degree and is practicing in a
related field). Team members will begin the competition phase with
brainstorming session about the central challenge presented by the speakers.
With the encouragement of their mentors, they will work through a series of
timed events and deliverables designed to support project completion. 

Houston-area girls 11-14 and in grades 6, 7 and 8 are invited to apply. To
ensure participation across the greater metropolitan area, registration is
limited to 3 girls from any one school or organization.

Participation is free, thanks to generous support of sponsors who recognize
the workforce of tomorrow begins to "catch it and grow" in middle school
today.
