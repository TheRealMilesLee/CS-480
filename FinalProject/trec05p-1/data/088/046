Marie, the counterparty states that the Coverage Ratio should be 2.5, rather than 3.5. Will you please confirm that 2.5 is the correct amount?  If it is, I'll need to correct the original and send the counterparty a revised confirmation.

"Material Adverse Change" means (a) with respect to Counterparty, it shall have any of the following occur at any time:  (i) the ratio of its Total Debt to Net Worth is more than 1.5 to 1, or (ii) its Net Worth falls below U.S. $70,000,000, or (iii) its EBITDA Coverage Ratio shall be less than 3.5 to 1; or (b) with respect to ENA, its Credit Support Provider's Credit Rating is below "BBB-" by S&P.

Thanks for your assistance!

Gordon
