I'll try, but no promises.  If I can't, is there someone else from the environmental area that would be good, like Mike Terraso or Terence Thorn ?(Interestingly I have them both listed as Chief Environmental Officer)  It would be better if the person was an officer anyway.  If I can swing the Public Affairs, can we make it Mark Palmer since he's been very involved with us and is a VP?  Lynne

Not in theory..but, and this is highly confidential, Jeff is
likely(99.9%) to be a victim of downsizing. Can't we have Public Affairs
back?

Rick, I'm following up on our earlier conversation about Enron's
leadership role in our committees.  I need to give the Public Affairs
slot to another company, in order to spread the wealth around.  Things
are still in flux but I'm proposing to the Exec Committee that Jeff
Keeler take over the Environmental Committee.  That is obviously
becoming an increasingly important committee as Congress and the
Administration look at air pollutant regulation changes, and I know
Enron is taking an activist role.  Do you have a problem with this?
Lynne
