Hi Michelle,

The presentation went as well as it could.  There was quite a bit of stunned silence, but the questions are already starting to trickle in.

One particular question on unemployment insurance I'm not familiar with, hoping you or Drew can help.

Since the VSP is effectively a voluntary election, would employees qualify for unemployment insurance, specifically in New York State.

Under the involuntary program, is the severance payment offset by unemployment compensation?

You can see where this question is leading, some people may be hedging their bets on the time value of the money.

Thanks
Cathy
