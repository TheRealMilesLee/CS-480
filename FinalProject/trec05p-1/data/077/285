MR CHEUNG PUI
Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
Sai Wan Ho Branch,   
83, Des Voeux Road,
Hong Kong.

Good Day,

Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Cheung
Pui director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
I have a obscured business suggestion for you.


Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi
Bassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business
man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar
months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five
Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my
branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him,
even during the war early last year. Again after the
war  another notification was sent and still no
response came from him. We later find out that the
Major and his family had been killed during the war in
bomb blast that hit their home.


After further investigation it was also discovered
that Major Fadi Bassem  did not declare any next of
kin in his official papers including the paper work of
his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last
time he was at my office that no one except me knew of
his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five
Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying
in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim
it. What bothers me most is that according to the to
the laws of my country at the expiration 4 years the
funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong
Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.
Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I
will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of
kin to Major Fadi Bassem  so that you will be able to
receive his funds. 


WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned
out so that we shall come out successful. I have
contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary
document that will back you up as the next of kin to
Major Fadi Bassem , all that is required from you at
this stage is for you to provide me with your Full
Names and Address so that the attorney can commence
his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the
attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf
and secure the necessary approval and letter of
probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an
account that will be provided by you.


There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we
are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney
will prepare all the necessary documents. Please
endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters
concerning this issue. Once the funds have been
transferred to your nominated bank account we shall
negotiate our sharing percentage and agreed on it.


Should you be interested please send me your full
names and current residential address  and I will
prefers you to reach me on the email address below 
(cheung477pui@yahoo.com.hk) 
and finally after that i shall provide you with more
details of this operation.

Your earliest response to this letter will be
appreciated.


Kind Regards,
Mr. Cheung Pui.
