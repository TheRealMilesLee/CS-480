University of Texas police have smashed a suspected terrorist cell. 
Three terrorists, Bin Losin, Bin Whinin, and Bin Cryin were apprehended 
on the UT campus shortly after the defeat of the Longhorn football team
by the University of Oklahoma Sooners. University police warn a fourth 
terrorist, Bin Winnin, is still at large. However, sources within 
the department concede that Winnin would be very conspicuous on the UT
campus and suspect he has fled to the campus of Oklahoma University.
