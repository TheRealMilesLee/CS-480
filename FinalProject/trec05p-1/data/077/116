Attached is a spreadsheet that lists all the new generation projects that need artcicle X permitting for New York.  The newest generation coming online is Coneds 360 MW East River Repowering slated for Q4 2002.  However, after speaking to Coned this morning this plan seems a little ambitous and won't probably come online until 2003.  Construction on this project has not yet begun and will be GE Frame7s.  The only substantial MWs under construction is PG&E's Athens plant which is 1080 MWs in Zone F slated for Q3 2003.  Everything else posted is still in planning stages.  However, these numbers do not show any generation under 80 MW that don't require an article X permitting process.  The estimated amount of potential new supply for NYC is 380MW and 204MW for Long Island that could come online that don't require permitting.  

Overall supply recap,  no new sizeable generation slated probably until end of 2003 or early 2004.  Last summer on Aug9 the NYISO peaked at 31,050 MW and Coned peaked at 12,134 MW.  The NYISO predicts that given an extreme weather case the max demand  can goto 32,290 MW.  I will keep everybody updated on any new supply changes.  You can access this website  http://www.dps.state.ny.us/articlex.htm  whichs shows the new generation projects in NY.
