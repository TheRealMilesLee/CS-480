> sought Miguel's advice on several occasions as he is the one who is a

> client ended when we made the decision to stop looking.  Keith has not
> asked for Miguel's advice beyond that point and therefore your criticism

> the only thing you have mentioned is being offended that Keith offered

> whatever your reasons are and I am sorry if that offended either of you.
> Finally, Keith and I are not 12 years old and it is not acceptable to talk
