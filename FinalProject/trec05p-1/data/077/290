One day Satan and Jesus were having a conversation.   Satan had just come
from the Garden of Eden, and he was gloating and boasting.   Yes, sir, I
just  caught the world full of people down there.  Set me a trap, used
bait I knew
they couldn't resist. Got 'em all!"


"What are you going to do with them?" Jesus asked.

Satan  replied, "Oh, I'm gonna have fun! I'm gonna teach them how to marry
and divorce each other, how to hate and abuse each other, how to drink and
smoke and curse.   I'm gonna teach them how to invent guns and bombs and
kill each other. I'm really gonna have fun!"

"And what will you do when you get done with them?"  Jesus asked.

"Oh, I'll kill 'em," Satan glared proudly.

"How much do you want for them?" Jesus asked.

"Oh, you don't want those people. They ain't no good. Why, you'll take
them and they'll just hate you.   They'll spit on you, curse you and kill
you!! You don't want those people!!"

"How much?" Jesus asked again.

Satan looked at Jesus and sneered, "All your tears, and all your blood."

Jesus said, "DONE!"    Then He paid the price.

Isn't it funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder
why the world's going to hell.

Isn't it funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what
the Bible says.

Isn't it funny how everyone wants to go to heaven provided they do not
have to believe, think, say, or do anything the Bible says. Or is it
scary?

Isn't it funny how someone can say "I believe in God"  but still follow
Satan (who, by the way also "believes" in God).

Isn't it funny how you can send a thousand jokes through e-mail and they
spread like wildfire, but when you start sending messages regarding the
Lord, people think twice about sharing.

Isn't it funny how the lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene pass freely through
cyberspace, but the public discussion of Jesus is suppressed in the school
and workplace.

Isn't it funny how someone can be! so fired up for Christ on Sunday, but
be an invisible Christian the rest of the week.

Are you laughing?

Isn't it funny how when you go to forward this message, you will not send
it to many on your address list because you're not sure what they believe,
or what they will think of you for sending it to them.

Isn't it funny how I can be more worried about what other people think of
me than what God thinks of me.

Will YOU pass this on? I did
