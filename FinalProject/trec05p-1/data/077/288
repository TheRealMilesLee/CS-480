Sevil,
 
As I stated to you yesterday, I am extremely sorry for causing so much confusion over the non-existent compensation concern.  I would like to reassure you though that there are no problems or concerns, and that I was just letting my mind get ahead of me, and was mixing different thought processes and projects.  Unfortunately, you had to reap the repercussions of my brain malfunction.   I hope that you accept my apology, and can rest with an easy mind.
 
Anne
