I agree with Teb.
(I have programed my e-mail so that this is always the opening line.)

The FTS-1 remains FTS-1 the entire time period.  It does not convert back to SFTS.  Chattahoochee is simply holds all FTS-1 rights and obligations between releases.  There is no requirement regarding time periods between releases.  The only requirements regarding time is the limitation that switches from SFTS to FTS-1 and FTS-1 to SFTS cannot be sooner than 12 months.  (Sheet No 31.)

If Chattahoochee converted all of their SFTS  to FTS-1 for the purpose of release, there is no problem with a gap.  If they still hold any SFTS,  they cannot have FTS-1 capacity at the same time, even for 1 month.

I have a question about the SFTS conversions that were done a while back so that the customer could utilize our capacity release program.  I noticed that The City of Chattahoochee converted their SFTS to FTS-1 and that the temporary acquisitions on their FTS-1 have a gap.  More specifically, they have a release in place for 10/1/02 thru 4/30/03 and the next release begins 10/1/03 thru 4/30/04.  Do the releases have to be consecutive in order for them to retain their conversion to FTS-1?  Because they will not have a release in place for May thru Sept. of 2003 according to their releases.  Is this wrong?  I haven't checked to see if this occurs on any of the other coversions and will if this is an issue.  Please advise.  nb
