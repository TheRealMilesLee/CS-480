BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financial structuring and investment,

other aspects re|ating to Wind Power.

This deve|opment wil| be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $120

upwards of 17O,O00 Mw of e|ectricity annual|y for Po|and and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supp|y upwards of 25,000 homes with
e|ectricity and offset near|y 17O,O00 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Total gross
