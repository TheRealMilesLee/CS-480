FERC Gives OK to North Baja Pipeline

Jan. 16 -- The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission gave final approval
on Wednesday to the U.S. segment of the North Baja Pipeline project that
will bring natural gas from Mexico to fuel electric generating plants in
southern California and northern Mexico. The $230 million pipeline will
be operated by an international subsidiary of Sempra Energy , PG&E Corp.
and Mexico-based Proxima Gas S.A. de C.V. The 215-mile pipeline (346-km)
would carry up to 500 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. FERC
gave final approval for the project after determining the pipeline would
not harm the environment.

University of Houston Study Favors Phased Development of Northern
Frontier Gas

An energy consultant who grew up in Alaska believes the least risky way
to tap the North Slope's huge natural gas reserves is to do so in
stages, running multiple pipelines across the Canadian Arctic during the
next 16 years. 

Ron Oligney, director of engineering research development at the
University of Houston, said Tuesday that smaller pipelines built every
few years would reduce the huge costs and risks that would come with a
single, larger pipeline to the Lower 48. 

He and colleague Jim Longbottom of the University of Houston recently
completed a study on Alaska and northwest Canada gas development. The
university and private clients paid for the study, he said. On Tuesday,
Oligney presented the findings to members of the Society of Petroleum
Engineers and the International Association of Energy Economics at the
Atwood Building in downtown Anchorage.
