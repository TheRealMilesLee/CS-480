Thanks for the info.  A couple of things about the data: 1) What does the (7,849) BCF represent?  Is that all of ENA Gas?(We can do away with the East and West and just report it as US)  Have we really gotten that much shorter from 11/30, when we were (219) BCF short?  2) Can you also provide the p&l numbers for columns Q through T?

Thanks,
Chris
