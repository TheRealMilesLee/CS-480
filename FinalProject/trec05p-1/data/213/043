Dearly Beloved in Christ,

It is by the grace of God that I received Christ,Having known the  truth, I had no choice than to do what is lawful and right in the sight of  God for eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God¥s mercy  and glory upon my life.

I am Mrs Melissa Pointer the wife of  Mr Harry Pointer, my husband  worked with the Chevron/Texaco in Kenya for twenty years before he died in  the year 2001.We were married for twenty-seven years without a child.  My Husband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.  Before his death we were both born again Christians. 

Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my  matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was  alive he deposited the sum of US $3.5M. (Three Million Five  Hundred  Thousand U.S. Dollars) with a Bank in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the Bank and the management just  wrote me as the beneficiary to come forward to sign for the release of  this money or rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to  receive it on my behalf if I can not come over.

Presently, I'm in a hospital in Kenya where I have been undergoing  treatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and  my doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my  last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations any 
where in the World. Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since 
my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge  responsibility to any of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to help  me Stand and collect the Funds from the Bank.

I want a person that is God fearing that will use this money to fund  churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure  that the house of God is maintained. 
The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit  this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want  my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't  want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of  death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the  bosom of the Lord. 

Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold  my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my soundless voice and presence of my husband's relatives around me always.  I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible.  

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of 
Attorney who is in Europe as he will be the one to assist you in laying  claims for this funds.

Please send all emails to : pointmelissa44@yahoo.co.in

Yours in Christ,
Melissa Pointer.
