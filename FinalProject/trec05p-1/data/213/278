Linda/Darrell:	I just talked to Jerry Ridge from the TW Artesia Team about the 4 Pecos Diamond points.  He has had a recent inquiry to possible re-actiivate these meters at the plant.  I would not remove any of the 4 points, because they might be needed in the near future.  The POI's are 9164, 9166, 9167 and 9168.  

Call with any questions, PT  3-0667.

The TMS testers entered a defect stating POI 9168, TW Yates Atoka Pecos Diamond PL 8 Inch, was inactive.  Please let Karen or myself know whether this point should be inactivated in PLE and as of what date.

Thanks

Linda
