Sally, I got together with Hunter this morning and as a result of our discussion we have reworked the Netco Logistics list. The plan now is to get together today with the rest of the deskheads and review what you, Hunter and I have done so far. I made sure Hunter knew that you have already provided Lavo with a list based on our discussion Sunday. 

Let me know if you have any questions, tks - Bob
