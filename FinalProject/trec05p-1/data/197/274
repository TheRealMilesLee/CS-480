This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and established of new farm in Swaziland=2EThese land problems came when Zimbabwean President Mr=2ERobert Mugabe introduce a new Land Act reform which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks farmers=2EThis resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society=2EIn fact a lot of people were killed because of this NEW LAND REFORMED ACT for which my father was one of the victim=2E
