personal regards

Jazz came to America three hundred years ago in chains.
Hope is a waking dream.
Be nice to people on your way up because you'll meet them on your way down.

In life, as in chess, forethought wins.
The brain can be easy to buy, but the heart never comes to market.
Why since I am myself subject to birth, ageing, disease, death, sorrows and defilement, do I seek after what is also subject to these things? Suppose, being myself subject these things, seeking danger in them, I were to seek the unborn, unageing, undiseased, deathless, sorrowless, undefiled supreme surcease of bondage, the extinction of all these troubles?Our first and last love is — self love.
Our civilization lacks humane feeling. We are humans who are insufficiently humane! We must realize that and seek to find a new spirit. We have lost the sight of this ideal because we are solely occupied with thoughts of men instead of remembering that our goodness and compassion should extend to all creatures. Religion and philosophy have not insisted as much as they should on the fact that our kindness should include all living creatures.- Letter to Aida Fleming
