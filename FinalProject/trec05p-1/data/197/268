	Shelley, I would like your opinion on a statement we are considering
	putting into a letter to Alliant to address some issues they have.
	See what you think of this paragraph.  I am trying to think of another
	word other than "retroactively" (that word bothers me).  They are trying
	to get this letter out this week.  Thanks for your help.  Lynn

In our meeting, it was suggested to delete the phrase where Northern "would only consider a change which includes but is not limited to ..." and rewrote as follows:

Alliant requested Northern be more flexible and, if requested, consider from time to time to make retroactive scheduling changes.  Northern's practice is to NOT retroactively schedule quantities.  At any time a shipper has requested a review of scheduled quantities, Northern will review the situation on non-discriminatory, case-by-case basis.  If a situation arises, Alliant should call Lynn Blair at 713-853-7637.

Let me know if this is okay or if you have comments.  Thanks!
