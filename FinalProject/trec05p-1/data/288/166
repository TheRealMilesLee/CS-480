Check out the latest news:

Two-thirds of overweight women say they feel that life is not worth living because of their size, 
a survey reveals. Of the 4,000 questioned for the National Slimming survey, only 1% were happy 
with their shape. Nine out of 10 felt depressed and eight out of 10 utter despair about their weight.

The research for Slimming World found overweight men faced similar angst based on replies from 1,000 men. 
More than nine out of 10 of those questioned said they felt like "second class citizens" and seven out 
of 10 said they had been "pilloried and poked fun at". Overall, 98% said that society discriminated 
against overweight people. 

Don't be one of these people, it's time for a change. Do it now at http://seethed.ourluckyzone.com/h
