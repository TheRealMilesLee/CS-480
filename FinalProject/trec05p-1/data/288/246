Regional CEO



hot spears at us. Its light only proved to be a "sparkling darkness", which attracted us but failed to comfort us. This system wasn't flawless either. The government of the people couldn't do good to the people itself. There might have been a change of system, but for us, the common men, it only brought "another government". Too much freedom didn't bring us too much prosperity. It became more and more difficult to make both ends meet. I lost my job and I would wander like a dog in search of work. Mia got sick because of malnutrition.
