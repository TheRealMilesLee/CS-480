Please join me for an open discussion floor meeting on Wednesday, November 7, at 2:30 pm on the 39th floor near EB3922. 

This will be an opportunity for me to update you on what is currently happening within Enron, EGS and ETS, as well as an opportunity for me to answer any questions you have.

I look forward to seeing you there, and thank you for your continued hard work and support of our company.

Stan
