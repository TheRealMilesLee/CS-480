Hello all, there is a new foundation in the North Bay (Beth Perkins
Equestrian Foundation) that was set up last year to benefit equestrians
that have been diagnosed with life-threatening diseases to help them
cope with the cost and the time-off. The primary recipient this year is
Margie MacDonald she has Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
    The fundraiser is Sunday, December 2 from 3-6pm at Hawkwood Hill
Farm in Petaluma. Nora, Pat and I went last year and it was really fun.
They have wine and hors d'oeuvres, silent auction, raffle and riding
demo. All for the tax-deductible donation of $35. If you want to go I
can order tickets (they will be $45 at the door).   kari
