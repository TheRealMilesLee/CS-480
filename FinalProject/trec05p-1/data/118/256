In other interesting news, you may have heard that Senator Dunn subpoened the old ISO Board, and intended to question them in secret to uncover more evidence of conspiracies, etc. (if you haven't heard, the new scapegoat is the ISO staff and the Board).

The ISO staff and its CEO Terry Winter have announced that they want their testimony to be public rather than secret, with the press present.  In testimony last week, staff apparently told the subcommittee "that they felt pressured to provide DWR with market information not available to others."

We'll see if transcripts are available.  FERC Enforcement may have an interest.

Best,
Jeff

We should inform FERC Enforcement.  No formal filings.

Normally I'd say this is unbelievable...but considering who sent it, I can't say I'm surprised...

Ray,

Should we take this up with Bob Pease, or since it was inadequate to begin with, just forget it?
