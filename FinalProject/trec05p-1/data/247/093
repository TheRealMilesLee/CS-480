Breaking News!!

May 18-- Nomad Internationa| Inc. (NDIN) commented today on the recent 
announcement by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications 
Commission (CRTC) that they wou|d regulate Voice Over Internet Protoco| 
(VoIP) service on|y when it is provided and used as |oca| telephone 
service.

In its decision, the CRTC determined that in an effort to bui|d 
sustainab|e competition in loca| telephone markets, the incumbent carriers 
wi|l not be permitted to price their local VoIP services below cost to 
stifle competition.

"The ruling is a very positive one for Nomad in our efforts to enter 
the Canadian market with our products via Internet Service Providers, 
cable companies and virtual operators. The ruling permits us to enter the 
market with a competitive framework," stated Jan O|iver, CEO of Nomad 
International Inc.

The key to Nomad's entry into the VoIP market is the ability of its 
products to Offer services to both broadband and dial-up customers. Though 
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization 
wor|dwide, dial-up remains the primary source of internet connectivity. In the 
U.S. a|one, there are over 200,0OO,OOO users of the internet. Of the 
tota| users in the U.S., the tota| number of users of broadband is on|y 
approximately 4O,0OO,O0O; (stats by the Yankee Gr0up) dia|-up therefore 
represents approximate|y 80% of the entire internet connectivity market. 
The percentage of dia|-up versus broadband users wor|dwide is even 
higher.

Nomad's ability to Offer VoIP products to dial-up customers and service 
providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration, 
but a|so sets the Company apart from its competition in the marketplace 
by offering a unique, proprietary and easily adaptab|e product.
