Good Morning,

I am Engr. Jacob Mbulezi, a Native of Cape Town in South Africa and I 
am a Director of Projects with the South Africa Department of Mining & 
Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium 
to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is 
due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.

I am making this contact with you based on my committee's need foreign 
individual or a company who is willing to assist us with a funds 
transfer. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you 
in the execution of the deal described here under for the benefit of 
all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the 
nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as a 
director and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have 
in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Nineteen Million, 
One Hundred Thousand united states dollars (US$19,100,000.00) which we 
want to transfer abroad with the assistance and co-operation of a 
foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf into 
a reliable company/individual account depending on your convenience.

More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa 
Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore 
account hence your importance the whole transaction. This amount 
(US$19.1m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed 
on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the 
officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost 
have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the 
tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to 
remit by Key Tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank 
account you will provide by filing in an application through the 
Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and 
privileges of the former contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should 
you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum 
will be 25% of the US$19.1 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and 
miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part 
provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also 
your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful 
execution of this transaction.

I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not 
disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my  email 
whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it 
will enable me contact other foreign partner with recommendation to 
carry out this deal. I want to assure you that myself and my partners 
are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided 
you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share 
will be secured and Please remember to treat this matter as very 
confidential matter because we will not comprehend with any form of 
exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember 
once again that time is of the essence in this business.

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. I am available on 
my email to entertain any questions concerning the clarity of this 
transaction. Send your secured telephone and fax numbers for further 
details upon your acceptance of this proposal,this will enable me to 
call and fax all details for your undestanding before we commence.

Thank you in anticipation of your co-operation.
 
Best Regards,
 
Jacob Mbulezi. (Engr.)
