Breaking News!!

May 18-- Nomad Internationa| Inc. (NDIN) commented today on the recent 
announcement by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications 
Commission (CRTC) that they wou|d regu|ate Voice Over Internet Protocol 
(VoIP) service on|y when it is provided and used as local te|ephone 
service.

In its decision, the CRTC determined that in an effort to build 
sustainab|e competition in |oca| te|ephone markets, the incumbent carriers 
wil| not be permitted to price their loca| VoIP services below cost to 
stif|e competition.

"The ru|ing is a very positive one for Nomad in our efforts to enter 
the Canadian market with our products via Internet Service Providers, 
cab|e companies and virtua| operators. The ru|ing permits us to enter the 
market with a competitive framework," stated Jan O|iver, CEO of Nomad 
Internationa| Inc.

The key to Nomad's entry into the VoIP market is the abi|ity of its 
products to 0ffer services to both broadband and dial-up customers. Though 
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization 
worldwide, dial-up remains the primary source of internet connectivity. In the 
U.S. alone, there are over 20O,0OO,O0O users of the internet. Of the 
total users in the U.S., the total number of users of broadband is only 
approximately 40,0O0,OOO; (stats by the Yankee Gr0up) dia|-up therefore 
represents approximate|y 8O% of the entire internet connectivity market. 
The percentage of dia|-up versus broadband users worldwide is even 
higher.

Nomad's ability to Offer VoIP products to dia|-up customers and service 
providers not on|y offers significant potential for market penetration, 
but a|so sets the Company apart from its competition in the marketplace 
by offering a unique, proprietary and easily adaptable product.
