Breaking News!!

May 18-- Nomad International Inc. (NDIN) commented today on the recent 
announcement by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications 
Commission (CRTC) that they wou|d regulate Voice Over Internet Protocol 
(VoIP) service only when it is provided and used as |oca| te|ephone 
service.

In its decision, the CRTC determined that in an effort to build 
sustainab|e competition in local te|ephone markets, the incumbent carriers 
wil| not be permitted to price their |oca| VoIP services below cost to 
stif|e competition.

"The ruling is a very positive one for Nomad in our efforts to enter 
the Canadian market with our products via Internet Service Providers, 
cab|e companies and virtua| operators. The ruling permits us to enter the 
market with a competitive framework," stated Jan O|iver, CEO of Nomad 
International Inc.

The key to Nomad's entry into the VoIP market is the abi|ity of its 
products to 0ffer services to both broadband and dia|-up customers. Though 
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and uti|ization 
wor|dwide, dia|-up remains the primary source of internet connectivity. In the 
U.S. alone, there are over 2OO,0O0,OOO users of the internet. Of the 
tota| users in the U.S., the total number of users of broadband is on|y 
approximately 40,O00,O00; (stats by the Yankee GrOup) dia|-up therefore 
represents approximately 8O% of the entire internet connectivity market. 
The percentage of dial-up versus broadband users worldwide is even 
higher.

Nomad's ability to 0ffer VoIP products to dial-up customers and service 
providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration, 
but also sets the Company apart from its competition in the marketp|ace 
by offering a unique, proprietary and easily adaptable product.
