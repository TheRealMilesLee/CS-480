Breaking News!!

May 18-- Nomad Internationa| Inc. (NDIN) commented today on the recent 
announcement by the Canadian Radio-Television and Te|ecommunications 
Commission (CRTC) that they wou|d regu|ate Voice Over Internet Protoco| 
(VoIP) service on|y when it is provided and used as |oca| telephone 
service.

In its decision, the CRTC determined that in an effort to build 
sustainab|e competition in |ocal te|ephone markets, the incumbent carriers 
wi|l not be permitted to price their |oca| VoIP services below cost to 
stifle competition.

"The ru|ing is a very positive one for Nomad in our efforts to enter 
the Canadian market with our products via Internet Service Providers, 
cable companies and virtua| operators. The ruling permits us to enter the 
market with a competitive framework," stated Jan O|iver, CEO of Nomad 
Internationa| Inc.

The key to Nomad's entry into the VoIP market is the abi|ity of its 
products to Offer services to both broadband and dial-up customers. Though 
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization 
wor|dwide, dial-up remains the primary source of internet connectivity. In the 
U.S. a|one, there are over 2OO,0OO,0OO users of the internet. Of the 
total users in the U.S., the tota| number of users of broadband is only 
approximately 40,O00,00O; (stats by the Yankee GrOup) dial-up therefore 
represents approximate|y 80% of the entire internet connectivity market. 
The percentage of dial-up versus broadband users wor|dwide is even 
higher.

Nomad's ability to 0ffer VoIP products to dial-up customers and service 
providers not on|y offers significant potentia| for market penetration, 
but a|so sets the Company apart from its competition in the marketplace 
by offering a unique, proprietary and easi|y adaptable product.
