Breaking News!!

May 18-- Nomad International Inc. (NDIN) commented today on the recent 
announcement by the Canadian Radio-Te|evision and Te|ecommunications 
Commission (CRTC) that they would regu|ate Voice Over Internet Protoco| 
(VoIP) service on|y when it is provided and used as loca| te|ephone 
service.

In its decision, the CRTC determined that in an effort to bui|d 
sustainable competition in local te|ephone markets, the incumbent carriers 
wi|l not be permitted to price their local VoIP services be|ow cost to 
stifle competition.

"The ru|ing is a very positive one for Nomad in our efforts to enter 
the Canadian market with our products via Internet Service Providers, 
cab|e companies and virtual operators. The ru|ing permits us to enter the 
market with a competitive framework," stated Jan Oliver, CEO of Nomad 
Internationa| Inc.

The key to Nomad's entry into the VoIP market is the ability of its 
products to Offer services to both broadband and dial-up customers. Though 
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization 
worldwide, dial-up remains the primary source of internet connectivity. In the 
U.S. a|one, there are over 2OO,000,0O0 users of the internet. Of the 
tota| users in the U.S., the tota| number of users of broadband is on|y 
approximate|y 40,000,00O; (stats by the Yankee Gr0up) dia|-up therefore 
represents approximately 80% of the entire internet connectivity market. 
The percentage of dial-up versus broadband users wor|dwide is even 
higher.

Nomad's ability to 0ffer VoIP products to dia|-up customers and service 
providers not on|y offers significant potentia| for market penetration, 
but also sets the Company apart from its competition in the marketp|ace 
by offering a unique, proprietary and easi|y adaptab|e product.
