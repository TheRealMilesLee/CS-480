About Bio-Matrix Scientific Group Inc.: 

Bio-Matrix Scientific Group Inc. is a San Diego based development stage co=
mpany in the business of medical devices and monitoring systems research, =
development and commercialization. Bio-Matrix Scientific Group Inc. is ali=
gning itself with partners that offer key technologies in biomedical devic=
e development, tissue engineering, cell culturing, genome therapy and drug=
 delivery systems. Its polymer coating on medical devices will ensure that=
 cell transference is done with minimal damage to cells. This should lead =
to better yields in stem cell extraction, along with better outcomes for p=
atients in tissue management procedures.

 Recent News:       A spokesperson for the Company said that its Board of =
Directors plans to spin-off 6,035,501 shares of the common stock of Frezer=
, Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of Bio-Matrix Scientific Group, to BMXP shareholders of record =
as of May 31, 2005.
This represents one share of Frezer, Inc. for every one share of Bio-Matri=
x Scientific Group Inc. (Pink Sheets:BMXP) owned post reverse split.

"Ground floor" Company Enters Production Phase 

Bio-Matrix Scientific Group Inc., announced that Collective Technologies w=
ill manufacture Bio-Matrix's first set of Stem Cell Devices. The Company a=
nticipates having this set of instruments sometime within the next two wee=
ks. BMXP also recently finalized applications for 3 new devices. 

This is the first step towards full production of these devices. This firs=
t set of devices will be used for its 510(k) testing, trade shows and pres=
entations to Physicians and Researchers. "Collective Technologies enables =
us to manufacture products in the most efficient and cost-effective way po=
ssible," noted Brian Pockett, Managing Director and COO of Bio-Matrix Scie=
ntific. "We have been impressed by Collective Technologies' quality record=
, responsiveness and flexibility - all of which are critical to our produc=
tion objectives." Bio-Matrix sees this event as nearing a point at which t=
he Company "green-lights" full production of its stem cell and tissue mana=
gement instruments.

Management 
Non-Invasive Bio-Systems Monitoring and Measuring Devices 
Niche Medical Device Instrumentation 
The Company has recently filed a provisional patent application with the U=
 S. Patent Office. It anticipates numerous utility patents will result fr=
om this filing.

Investment Prosective:

 
Bio-Matrix has a four pronged revenue strategy each with a different traje=
ctory and different inflection points. 
The company is spreading its risk over different operating segments with v=
arying investment requirement and levels of risk. 
Larger companies in the medical device industry are aggressive and smaller=
 companies are always takeover targets. 
 


Potential of BMXP:
 
The market size of the segments it has chosen to operate in is huge. The t=
issue management instruments market size alone is $860 million. 
A provisional patent application has already been filed and more are in th=
e pipeline.
