Things haven't changed much since you left (that shouldn't surprise you given that you only left about 10 minutes ago).  Glad to hear all is well and, as I mentioned before, I am very pleased that something good for you came out of this whole mess.  Meyer's work number is 832-676-5149.  Best of luck.
 
Stuart

Stuart, 

        How's the estate? Bringing in any cash? Thing are good here, just breaking the rust off. Call me when you get sometime.  Also, I seem to have misplaced Meyers phone number. Would you send that to me, please.


Thanks 
Joe
