Sean, 

Enclosed is a proposed methodology for the Dow Jones Hourly Index.  Our
longer term goal is to have this information posted to a website and
available on an hourly basis, with perhaps a 2 or so hour delay.  That will
take longer to implement and some firms have expressed reservation with
receiving the information too early.  Presently, our goal is to have this
information available to traders via email by 5:00 a.m. PT.  This is
preliminary and your thoughts and comments would be appreciated.

Cheers,


Ernest Onukogu
