Dear Sir/Madam,
 
I am Dmitriy Gololobov and personal assistant to Mr. Mikhail Khordokovsky
the former C.E.O of the Russia's largest Oil company Yukos Oil Group who
was arrested in his private jet by masked and armed members of the security
police force (FSB) at a Siberian Airport in October 2003. He was charged
with fraud, embezzlement and $3.4bn tax evasion charges. But this was part
of Kremlin-inspired vendetta aimed at stripping the 41-year-old tycoon of
his economic and political clout.
As it stands, the Russian authorities have been seeking the extradition of
other high-profile Russian businessmen and Mr. Mikhail Khordokovsky close
associates which I happen to be one, others include Platon Lebedev, Leonid
Nevzlin, Vasily Shakhnovsky, Alexei Kurtsin, Boris Berezovsky, who has been
granted asylum in the UK, and Gusinsky, who managed to argue against being
sent back to Russia in both the Spanish and Greek Courts. I was once arrested
for advising Mr. Mikhail Khordokovsky's provision of funds to opposition
political parties and challenging of Kremlin policy as head of Yukos Oil
Group.  
But now, I have been released and placed under immigration security watchlist.
I cannot make or answer telephone calls, my only means of communication for
now is through email as I am seriously monitored. All I need from you is
to assist me make claims of some funds totalling US$45 Million which was
to be used in payment of an American Oil merchant for his last Oil deal with
my boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky. This funds which had already left the shore
of Russia to a security company somewhere in Netherlands for onward disbursement
to the said merchant before the arrest of Mr. Mikhail Khodorkovsky is currently
lying unclaimed following the arrest. 
As soon as this money is claimed by you, I will look for a way to sneak out
of Russia to meet with you so we can go into a life time partnership together
in investing this money in your country or anywhere else you prefer.  My
Attorney in contact with my attorney in holland  who is in possession of
every necessary legal document to backup your claim. All I require is your
honest cooperation.
I need not to remind you of the confidentiality which this transaction demands.
I will appreciate if you could keep this proposal secret even if you do not
want to assist me.
As I await your response, I would also want you to go though the below websites
for more details:
