Tana:

Would you please develop an NDA for the following prospective client:

Anglo American plc
20 Carlton House Terrace
London SW1Y 5AN 

Contact: Johan Serfontein
Phone: 27-11-373-6800

This will be for a potential private eMarketplace software license sale, similar to my other prospects.

Would you please e-mail me one this afternoon if at all possible?  I am going to send him an e-mail summarizing today's conversation and would like to include this as an attachment.  I'll have Johan get his lawyer to talk to you if they have questions.

Thanks,

Mike
