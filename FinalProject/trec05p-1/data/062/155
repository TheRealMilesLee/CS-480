To recap what we talked about this morning.  The following deals were done for June.  ENA is not showing these deals in you system so therefore they won't pay.  

6/7	sold 8500 to ENA @ 3.71	between Roger & Daren
6/12	sold 8500 to ENA @ 3.78	between Roger & Daren

6/20	sold 10000 to EOL @ 3.95	between Roger & EOL
