Gerald,

Can I get a standard CA put together for the following company:

Kinder Morgan CO2 Company, L.P.
500 Dallas
Suite 1100
Houston, TX  77002

The topic would be related to "certain compression assets in the SACROC Unit in Scurry County, TX."  I would like to get something to them ASAP, but no later than Monday as we are trying to meet with them on Friday morning next week.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Chris
