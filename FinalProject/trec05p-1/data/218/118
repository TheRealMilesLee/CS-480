Hey guys, 

We need to try and get this populated today and distributed.  Can each of you please take a look at the assigned section and let me know your comments.  The only thing we are trying to do here is identify the activities of the Estate and what needs to be performed by the resources in each group.

Cara & Mike will you please update the scheduling and trading areas? 

Stacey, will you please update the risk area?

I will work on the settlements / volume Management and I will work with Dave Steiner on the IT section.

Thanks so much for everyone's help.  I'm sorry I'm out of the office today.  We really need to get this done ASAP to help management understand who is available to assist in this time of transition.

Thanks - MO

Tom,

After our call today Mike Purcell and I spent a little time talking.  We also have some time schedule to Cara and Jeff Richter tomorrow  I have put together the attached  template which I will hopefully have filled out for you by tomorrow afternoon.

Our biggest concern today was how we would address the Real-Time scheduling requirements.  Mark Guzman is part of the estate and should be able to cover the day shift during the week and we can outsource to UBS to cover all the other shifts (Just a proposal).  In addition, Lester Rawson is part of the estate and has Real-Time experience and is also the individual who currently manages the El Paso obligations.

If you have any questions please give me a call @ 503-702-9846.
