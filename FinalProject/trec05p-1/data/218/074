On Monday, we will update access to the website with the names of people who have signed with UBS.  Jeanie Slone is going to forward the latest copy of the list to us on Monday morning, and we will update the security profile at that time.  I will let you know if the schedule changes.

Any progress on our access. We would really like to get a look at the weather up here.

I am waiting on a list of people who have signed with UBS - I requested one yesterday afternoon from HR.  I will send an e-mail when we get the security set up.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Chris,

Can you make sure that the guys in Calgary have access to the new fundy's site. I am having problems getting in.

Thanx
