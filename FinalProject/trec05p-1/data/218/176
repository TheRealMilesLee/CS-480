Hey there, kids.  We just wanted to remind you about some upcoming shows.  First of all, we'll be at the Medicine Hat Gallery on 2/7 -- it's a great room with the best sound in Portland.  Music starts at 9PM and we'll be on at 10PM.  For those of you who missed our last show there, you can hear it on our site www.24bom.com.  We will also be recording this show for our live, interactice cd we're working on (hopefully available sometime in May), and this may be your last chance to have your voice in the crowd.  Another great reason to attend is that we'll be followed by Junco Parker -- those of you who went to the Conan's show last month know how kick-booty those guys are.   We'll be taking the rest of the month off so Willie and Jenny can get married. Our first show will be a big one at The White Eagle on 3/8 with Lawnboys opening the show @ 9PM.  We've been looking forward to this one for a long time and we're very glad to have those fellers playing with us.  On 3/22 we'll be at Buffalo Gap all by our lonesome @ 9PM.  On April 6 we'll be back at the Hat playing on an ALLSTAR  bill with Junco Parker and Lawnboys (that is if Lawnboys ever confirm -- you know how difficult it is to pin down rockstars) show at 9:30.  We will be playing at the Jasmine Tree on 4/20 (ooh, 4:20!) with the super funky sounds of Hip Replacement.  Anyhow, that's the schedule for now, but stay tuned for more shows and maybe a suprise or two. 

Take it easy and we'll see you at the shows, 
Twenty Four Bitches on Mezcal
