motivation?</STRONG> </P>
<P>Here’s what we know. In real estate, it's always been “Location, Location, 
Location!”&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1990s technology boom, it was “Platform, Platform, 
Platform!”&nbsp; After the Internet stock bubble burst and the market sorted out 
the strong from the weak, things settled down and a new term gained prominence 
in technology circles: “Search Engine.” As Yahoo grew and eBay became 
interactive, tech visionaries could see that “Engine, Engine, Engine!” was the 
market's newest money making mantra.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In this millennium, the growth of Google and Ask Jeeves has proven that a 
good search engine can be a terrific money maker for its owners.&nbsp; 
<B>SoftNet Technology</B>, has its own proprietary commerce search engine that 
operates the innovative <B>WholesaleByUs.</B> (SoftNet acquired WholesaleByUs 
("WBU") on July 9, 2004).&nbsp; </P>
<P>As SoftNet changed its name and trading symbol to meet its new business model 
in August of this year, management chose to retain one of the Company's best 
performing products, instead of selling it off.&nbsp; <B>STTC</B> created a 
Solutions Technology subsidiary that would be solely dedicated to the Company's 
<B>SecureTime®</B> biometric payroll system.&nbsp; That's insight - and industry 
insiders liked the way SoftNet handled the transition and retention of a prime 
revenue stream.&nbsp; </P>
<P>So, the company now includes a search engine that Internet retailers can use 
to their benefit and a biometric ID system for securing work areas and producing 
complete payroll accuracy… in addition to their present ventures. </P>
<P>SoftNet is already operating in the Restaurant Industry and the Casino 
Industry with its SecureTime® software (<I>can hospitals and hotels be far 
behind?</I>) and the recent launch of&nbsp; the WholesaleByUs web site utilizing 
the Company's proprietary search engine is a clear indicator that the Company is 
on track, moving ahead, and generating sales.&nbsp; The aggressive nature of 
SoftNet's management and the products SoftNet has in operation may well warrant 
bookmarking their symbol and watching what happens.</P><FONT id=rolx_document

<P><B>Solutions Technology, Inc.</B><BR>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Solutions Technology, Inc. (STI) provides biometric identification solutions 
that easily integrate into customer business processes, and optimize several 
areas of business management that due to issues of security and inefficiecy, 
have historically squeazed companies’ profitablility. These areas include: 
identity verification, secure site access, and time &amp; attendance. 
Furthermore, the company, through its experienced management team, has developed 
a business model that will allow the company to completely eliminate the 
complexity and the cost of ownership for its customers. The combination of the 
STI tehnology and revolutionary business model have it positioned to provide a 
value proposition for businesses of any size, that will simply be difficult to 
beat. </P>
<P>The first part of the Solutions Technology equation, that seperates the 
company from others, is that STI offers its positive identification verification 
systems as a service. In other words, STI customers do not need to make an 
investment in hardware, software licensing, maintenance contract, spare parts. 
The customer will never need to purchase upgrades, and will never need an IT 
staff. The SecureTime System is simple to adopt, making it unique in an industry 
that due to the high cost of ownership and the complexity of biometric systems, 
has made it impossible for many companies to implement a solution that meets all 
of their needs. </P>
<P>STI also has developed proprietary technology, unmatched in its industry. 
Solutions Technology, Inc. (STI) offers a customized biometric system as a 
service that integrates fingerprint recognition security seamlessly into 
virtually any business. The system will dramatically minimize a company’s risks, 
streamline its processes, track its resources, and trim its labor costs. The STI 
system generates the secure data transactions and the reports that companies 
must have in order to raise the standards for security and efficiency of its 
business processes. </P>
<P>SecureTime® biometric solutions utilize cutting edge technologies that 
identify, capture, and manage these resources and other demand information. The 
system enables clients to supervise and control their resources precisely and 
become more efficient, directly affecting their bottom line. </P>
<P>The system consists of two key components: stand alone biometric terminals 
and a back office suite of software services managed by STI. The terminals 
operate independently at your site and are synchronized via internal modem or 
Internet access. Each biometric terminal verifies identity while recording a 
time-stamped transaction. The configurable back office suite performs data 
collection and report generation in a variety of formats, media types and 
delivery methods. Furhtermore, STI’s new SecureTime Online allows a business to 
get its own reports at any time from anywhere.

<P><B>WholesaleByUs</B></P>
<P>WholesaleByUs (WBU) is a web-based, application server based software system 
that looks to take advantage of the boom in internet commerce. In fact, Google's 
IPO focused investor attention on the growth of the overall search engine 
marketplace, while Shopping.com's IPO helped focus investor attention on 
comparison shopping search. WBU looks to take advantage of this burgeoning 
industry through its proprietary technology that optimizes every aspect of the 
internet marketplace. The WBU system gives customers the ability to provide 
suppliers, manufacturers, retail stores and the like, exponentially expanded 
visibility and awareness for their products. </P>
<P>Distribution and sale of manufacturer, supplier and retail outlet products 
utilizing the WBU technology for distribution and sale dramatically increases 
awareness and visibility for these products through different portals on the 
Internet. WBU's technology allows the companies that supply the products for 
sale through the WBU system to benefit from increased product offerings at no 
additional cost. The process simply cuts through the shopping search clutter to 
bring, the lowest retail price. </P>
