Marie,

My system is showing that Sid Richardson Carbon & Gasoline Co. Inc., Richardson Energy Marketing, Ltd's parent also trades with Enron Gas Liquids, Inc. physical natural gas liquids through an evergreen contract.   Young, Marshall R Oil Co., a sister company of Richardson shows no transactions, no exposure on my credit system.

There is an Enron company  LOA, Inc. that shows physical natural gas exposure with Richardson.  I called Bill Hayes at Richardson, and he will put together a list of their entities and products their currently trading with Enron for comparison purposes.  I'll let you know as soon as I get more information.
