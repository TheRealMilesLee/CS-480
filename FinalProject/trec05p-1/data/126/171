This filing strongly endorses the GridSouth Market Monitoring Plan in lieu of the non-plan filed by WestConnect?  Are we OK with that?

Dave or Christi--Can you send me or point me to the GridSouth MM Plan?  Thanks,

Ray or Dave, can you make the Wed  EPSA call where this filing will be discussed?

Jim,

I was not aware EPSA was filing an intervention to the WestConnect tariff.  After a cursory review of the attachment however, it very much lines up with what I have sent to Ray and Steve.  We focus a bit more on the lack of definition of a congestion management plan as well as hit on "hints" of where WestConnect is probably going to stay (contract path) based upon some clues in the filing.  We focus more on existing contracts (lack of conversion) as well as additional comments on the planning appendix.  They hit just about every other point we cover, independence, or lack thereof being the key.

Thanks,

Dave

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
      Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
           Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
           Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
           Erin Perrigo, Manager of Policy

DATE: November 12, 2001

RE: EPSA Draft Motion to Intervene and Protest in the
      WestConnect RTO filing
·			Filing due November 15th
·
Attached is EPSA's motion to intervene and protest in the WestConnect RTO filing (Docket Nos. EL02-9-000 and RT02-1-000).  The draft primarily focuses on independence and governance issues, however also highlights the WestConnect tariff, congestion management, market monitoring, pricing and interconnection aspects of the filing.  For example, the draft argues that the participating transmission owners retain too much authority over RTO operations, that FERC should require all RTO load to take service under the WestConnect tariff, and that WestConnect should adopt the GridFlorida market monitoring plan.

Interventions are due to FERC on Thursday, November 15th.  Please have any edits or comments to Erin Perrigo at eperrigo@epsa.org by noon on Wednesday, November 14th.   We'll also discuss the draft on this week's Regulatory Affairs conference call on Wednesday, November 14th, at 3:30 P.M. (EST).  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA Call.  If you have further questions or comments, please contact Erin Perrigo at eperrigo@epsa.org or 202-628-8200.
