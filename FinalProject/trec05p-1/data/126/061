Jay,

Just a quick note to let you know that Mom and Dad arrived around 10am on
Sunday morning.  I took the day off yesterday and we did a few things around
the house and a little shopping.  Uncle Bob arrived around 11:00am from
Phoenix and we went to lunch.  He was back on the road for Houston around
1:00pm.  There is a new subdivision going up down the street from us so we
walked down there yesterday afternoon and wandered through some of the
houses.  Dad seemed to enjoy it -- walking off the sq footage, inspecting
the construction, etc.

WR and I have been really watching the situation with Enron and have our
fingers crossed that things will work out for you now that the deal with
Dynergy has been announced.  Uncle Bob seemed to think that Paul is in a
pretty precarious situation with his job.

Take care and tell the girls 'Aunt Lyn says hi.'

Lyn
