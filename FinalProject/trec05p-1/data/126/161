Yes, the invoice he received is on noms.  Does it matter if it is not on the correct point?  As long as the volumes are ok?
How many volumes was the invoice, and how many was he expecting?
Please let me know.  Thanks, Gloria

Gloria,
I was looking at Path Manager and it doesn't look to me like they even pathed this CAN point.  Let me know what you find out - Mark Bergeron at Woodward is expecting a call back from us (Paul Lucci) today.  
Thanks.

Theresa.

(The invoice they received must be based on nominations - right?)

I will take a look at this and get back with you.  Thanks, Gloria
