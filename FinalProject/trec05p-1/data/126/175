Please feel free to provide us with either very brief or more 
extensive information.

1. What do you consider the greatest current assets and future 
opportunities for Haas?
2. What do you consider the largest current shortcomings and 
potential threats to Haas?
3. What attributes and skills do you recommend that we seek in a Dean?
4. What experiences do you regard as important in a Dean?
