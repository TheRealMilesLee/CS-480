Hello John -

We met a couple of weekends ago when I stopped by to ask you about the power plant in the photo on your wall. (..You also mentioned that you're a big Mario Lemieux fan.)

I'm writing because I'd actually like to invite you to lunch sometime. I have lunch with my stepfather, Bob Mosbacher, quite frequently downtown here at the Houston Club and it would be fun to invite you sometime. I know Dad M really enjoys meeting younger people here in the energy business and it'd would be fun for me to introduce you.

We are having lunch today at 12 Noon and while today is probably too late notice for you, 
you are invited anytime.

Regards,
Bobby
