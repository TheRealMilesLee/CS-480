Hi Errol,

Thank you for today's meeting - it was very informative and it was exactly
what we were looking for.

Per our conversations, you will provide us with the Definition Accrual
Accounting and provide us with an example of an Executive Report.

I would like to schedule some time with you on Tuesday, November 27th from
10:00 am - 11:00 am if possible.  Let me know what your schedule looks like
for that week (The week after Thanksgiving!)

Basically, develop it in Microsoft word, Arial 10 pt. Keep it succinct, use
active voice and use bullet points instead of text whenever possible. This
helps keep the reader from feeling overwhelmed.
