Hi Tana,

A couple of weeks ago I sent up to you (I think it was you) the letter I 
received regarding an assignment between Transcanada and Mirant.  

Joyce Reed from Mirant is looking for an update on the status.  Can you
give her a ring when you have a free second (ha!) - 403 218 1031.  

Thanks,
Diane

PS - Go Levittown!
