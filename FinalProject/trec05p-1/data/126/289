To confirm our meeting, in order of timing and/or commitment size priority, we need a summary of the following:

1.  What is the actual amount of the funding commitment, including the amount funded to date?

2.  When is the funding commitment required?

3.  What is the nature of the funding commitment - firm, or non-firm but advisable (and if so why)?

4.  What are the consequences of not funding from a business or project perspective?

5.  What are the consequences of not funding from a legal perspective, including any limited liability/spe protection?

Teresa and I should be able to fill in 5 once we have the answers on 1-4.

Teresa will you please work on outlining 5 in the interim.

Timing obviously depends on when the amounts are required, and the sooner the better.  It would be helpful if we could have something by Thursday evening latest.  Suffice to say, John will not be predisposed to fund these unless he understands the nature of the obligations.

Greatly appreciated.  Peter.
