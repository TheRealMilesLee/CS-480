To answer your question, I am not the person who can :"Specifically, I need the contact information for the EES utility liaison or 
the person at the utility who is responsible for verifying metering accuracy at this site."

The meter from the Wind units is sent to the ISO.  I don't know how it is sent in, but the ISO in turn sends the meter to our meter group in Houston.

I have no idea who "physically" manages this transaction.

Kathleen Croiset informed me that you were the contact for metering issues at Green Power.  The following email was sent to Richard Ring.  If you are better suited to address my inquiry, please let me know.

Asset Management is in the process of updating site information and seeking documentation of  revenue meter testing at Green Power.  Marion did not know who I should request this information from and suggested that I start with EES.  

All the other projects have a stipulation in their agreements requiring utilities to undertake testing of their metering equipment to verify the accuracy of such equipment.  If testing reveals that the equipment is outside of a specified range, then the utility will calibrate the meter.  

I am looking to send a request for evidence or certification of such testing at Green Power.  Specifically, I need the contact information for the EES utility liaison or 
the person at the utility who is responsible for verifying metering accuracy at this site.

If you know of anyone who can assist with this matter, please forward their contact information to me.

Thanks
