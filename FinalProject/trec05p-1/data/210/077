Sean, 
As you have probably hear, I am not going to be with  UBS, which is both a disappointment and a blessing, perhaps better things await me elsewhere.  While I have tried to convince myself of this, it is difficult to truly accept.  I just wanted to let you know how much I have enjoyed working with you, even if only for a short time.  Hopefully I will be able to stay on with the estate for a while, while things are being settled and I make some decisions regarding the direction of my career.  I should be in the office tomorrow and next week, perhaps we could chat, if you have any advice for me, I will gladly take it.  Best Regards, Serena
