        Considering Teb's comments relative to support activity for more than the Red Rock project then the OH order 
        may be the best option for now.  All should keep in mind that some new accounting rules may require these costs 
        to be expensed and only allow for costs directly related to a project be capitalized.

Jim - We've decided to settle for the less than ideal solution and charge the TW OH workorder instead of specific projects.

We can charge directly but still need some guidance.  For example, it is my understanding that there are 4 WO set up for Red Rock - one for each station to be modified.  Our work is of a general nature, so do we have to further subdivide our charges to each of the stations, or to three of the stations.  Also, some of our time is spent on a general analysis of regulatory strategy involving all capital projects, and it seems like the overhead WO would be appropriate for these charges.  We don't necessarily want to have to have each person charge to 3 or 4 WO for each identifiable capital project and then to 10 or more WO for our general work.  Any specific suggestions, WO numbers, etc. ?

In response to where to charge your time to for TW projects, Jim Saunders prefers that you charge directly if possible.  Let me know if we need to discuss.

this will allocate their charges to all tw projects...of course red rock dominates tw capital expenditures 
a direct charge to a red rock w/o would be ideal

The TW commercial and regulatory team are charging to the TW overhead WO for their time related to TW projects including Red Rock.  Is this how you think we should be handling?
