Has anyone seen anything on NSTAR? Steffes thought he saw something?

No.  I guess the question I have now is if NSTAR and UI have terminated, do we still need to keep EPMI in the NEPOOL market?

Do we need to do anything special in terms of notification to NEPOOL as it relates to the 1/1/02 termination of UI?

Thanks,
