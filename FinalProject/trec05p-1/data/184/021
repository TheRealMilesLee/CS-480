WITH LOW AIRFARES TO FLORIDA AND SAN JUAN, THINK CRUISE FROM $199 FOR 3 DAYS & $399 FOR 7 DAYS 

One of the best values this winter could be a cruise vacation on the Seven Seas. Wake up on a new island every day; all room and board is paid for. 24 hours of meals and the midnight buffet still starts at midnight. Can you believe that there are select sailings for as low as $199 per person for a three-day Nassau cruise or a seven-day eastern Caribbean cruise for only $399 per person? Of course you are not going to get the best cabin at these prices, but for as little as $60 to $100 more you can upgrade to the outside cabins. The trick is to be flexible! One week, a seven-day cruise could sell for $899 per person and the next week the same cruise could go for only $399 per person. Check out all of these short notice specials. This could be your best value for 2002. Visit <http://www.cheapcruises.com> Remember, if you're buying a cruise-only package and purchasing your airfare separately, try to fly in the day before. This will give you time to relax. Flying in the day of the cruise could be very stressful, especially if your plane delayed, cancelled, bad weather or Murphy's Law sets in.
