Good Afternoon Diana,

Did I capture your question correctly?

The users want to update the chapter11.exe program, that was developed to 'zero-out' schedule strip volumes for a given counterparty for a given day, to allow the users to zero-out the volume for a range of days?


IT Questions
1.  Schedule strips only get created for deals 2 days before day of flow.  So, based on the current design, the date range, at least looking forward, would only be a couple of days.
- Option 1:  Maybe, instead of zeroing out schedules, we should adjust the dates on the deal.  This would prevent schedule strips from even being created after a certain date?

2.  Working with John Postlethwaite & Stacey White, Will Smith has a program that converts deals from the real Enron books to a newly created West Bankruptcy book.  Will this work for you guys?

Anyway, just give me a call when you get a chance.

Thanks,  David Poston
