Shelley,

So extremely sorry for the delay in replying to your e-mail.

Confirmation of completion.  I did not see a 2002 United Way contribution in your Payroll record.  Therefore, you will not have any UW contribution coming out of your check.

Any future transaction inquiries, please forward your request to HR ServiceConnection@enron.com

Thank you ma'am.

The UW deductions are handled by the HR Service Center.  I have forwarded your request to Irma Alvarez for handling.

Diane,

Cindy replied back to ask you to take my contribution out of the payroll system.  And, that I should then call UW to bill me directly.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Hi Cindy,

I know this is a trivial question in the greater magnitude of things....so just drop me an email when you get a chance.

For my 2002 UW contribution, I asked to have a lumpsum payroll deduction in Feb.  (unsual bonus time).  Now, I want to have UW just bill me instead.  I can't seem to get back into the system to change this.   ????
