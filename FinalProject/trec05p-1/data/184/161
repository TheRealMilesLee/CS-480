Dear Sally & Beth,

We are already getting questions from different groups on how things will work in the new company (books, ERV, DPR).  They are all assuming that we are going with the new company.  I'm telling each of these groups that we are staying with the estate and as such, really don't know the answer to these qu's and are directing them to ask Jeff/Stacey.  Please let me know if either of you hear any info that would be of help.

Thanks
