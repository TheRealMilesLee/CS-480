I agree.  I hope that the first decision point, perhaps this week, answers
the "if" question.  Then, perhaps by the end of the month, if the answer to
"if" is "yes," we can then answer the "when" question.

I still think we're GO, but I heard Dorothy and Kim do the "it depends on
Enron" and Janell has the broken leg issue.  Hopefully it all works out
well.  We're not at the deadline yet but at some point we'll have to make a
call.

The first hurdle is the U of H accelerated Italian course in mid February
which I plan to attend unless we've aborted.  The real deadline is somewhere
around D-30 days when the air fare/schedule becomes harder to get.
