Effective January 1, 2002, the set point for Eagle flow controller should be set at 69,000 (There is no change from December, however November set point was 67,000).

Please note the flow control may be changed any day during the month when a Daily TFX is contracted to Eagle and/or Mukwanogo.  A revised set point will be communicated to Gas Control when a Daily TFX is tendered.

Thanks!
