Lets get on the phone today with (1) Bridgeline, (2) Gulf South, and (3) Dow to define a process for getting this sale done.  When are you available?

Regards,
Brian

Any word from Bridgeline regarding their (i) level of interest/ability to purchase the pad gas in Caverns #13 and #14 and/or (ii) willingness to pay the lease payment for Q4 directly to Dow?  Please advise.
