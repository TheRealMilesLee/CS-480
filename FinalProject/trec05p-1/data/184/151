Eric,

As we discussed, we need to take the most recent invoice from PB-KBB (the contractor that is responsible for injection of gas into Napoleonville) and have them bifurcate the bill into pre-bankruptcy and post-bankruptcy amounts (using 12/2 as the date of bankruptcy).  In the meantime, please prepare a Cash Use Request Form for the post-bankruptcy amount (Doug Sewell can assist you on this) for consideration by the Cash Committee.  [CHIP PLEASE CONFIRM THAT THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE COURSE OF ACTION]

Also, please forward Gerald's draft of new agreement to PB-KBB for their consideration along with any proposed changes to the scope of work description.
