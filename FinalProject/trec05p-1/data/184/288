Rutin is a member of bioflavonoids, a large grOup of phenolic secondary 
metabolites of plants that include more than 2,OOO different known 
chemicals. Bioflavonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are

With their unique and patented technology, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets worldwide.

ownership of proprietary techno|ogy, strong corporate relations with 
Chinese governmental agencies, certified manufacturing faci|ities and 
access to growing markets in which to sell its drug products.

Further developments of the transaction and the deve|opment at Huifeng 
shou|d be expected in the near future.
