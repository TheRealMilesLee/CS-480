T Jae-
 
I sent an email to Don Baughman last week stating that currently we are experiencing difficulty with our bankruptcy attorney's on having any "incentive pay" for exempt level employees. I am working with payroll and the attorney's to see if there is anything that we can do to have these people paid.  I am out this week, but  will be checking my email to see if there is some resolution.
 
Thanks,
Anne
