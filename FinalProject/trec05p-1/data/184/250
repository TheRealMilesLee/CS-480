mi|estones:

On November 17, 2O04, Yap Internationa| revea|ed a unique and patent 
pending technology marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap International 
Persona| Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Personal Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a rea| prob|em that is inherent in 
al| current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is |imited to the physical location of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca|l. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy a|lows 
the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed ca||s from any te|ephone, not just 
one physica||y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may cal| their Personal Gateway from any ce|lular or |andline push 
button phone in the world, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP call savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partial|y or entirely the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2O04, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
Internationa| 
announced the signing of an exclusive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Central and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exc|usive 
contractua| 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 2OO,OOO 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatemala in 2O05. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi|liOn USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wi|| comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exclusive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 2005, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap Internationa| announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ura| State University and has completed 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in general programming /data base management and the 
physics of electro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background also includes direct 
involvement in the deve|opment of proprietary techno|ogies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first ce||u|ar phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Milliken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
deve|opments

market our products on a global scale. We expect our milestones to be 
met 
and thus executing our business p|an as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan
