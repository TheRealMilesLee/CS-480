<DIV></DIV>&gt;Hi Monika Causholli, 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;

<DIV></DIV>&gt;way to getting higher test scores - and getting into your first choice 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;school. Below is some important information to help you use the course. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Be sure to save this email for future reference. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;LOGGING IN 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Just point your browser at www.PrincetonReview.com and click on "Sign In." 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;In the next window, click on "Sign In" under "Test Prep." Enter your 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;username &amp; password &amp; click Enter. Then click on the Online Companion 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Tools link to get started. For your records, here are the username and 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;password you selected when you registered:

<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Please note that you will have access to your Online Companion Tools for a 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;period of 120 days from today. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;If you plan on accessing your tools from multiple machines you'll need to 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;make sure each is configured properly by running our requirements check, 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;which is available through a link after you log in. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;LOGGING OUT 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;If you are using a public computer, like one in a library or dorm, it's a 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;very good idea to log out every time you finish your work on the website. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;All you have to do is click on the Exit link that appears at the right end 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;of the toolbar along the bottom of your tools dashboard. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;

<DIV></DIV>&gt;The machine and software requirements for using your tools are appended to 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the end of this message.

<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;MACHINE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS TO USE ONLINE COMPANION TOOLS 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Business before pleasure: in order to work with the Online Companion

<DIV></DIV>&gt;make sure you have the necessary software. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Minimum system requirements include: 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;* Internal or external modem with speed of 56 kbps 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;* Your machine should have a sound card to enjoy all the benefits (if you 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;do not have a sound card, you will still be able to use many features of 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the Online Student Center, including taking any computer-based 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;or -adaptive tests or drills online) 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;* 32 mg RAM 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;* CPU speed of 250 MHz 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Minimum software requirements 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;* Internet service provider (ISP), such as Earthlink/Sprint, AT&amp;T, AOL, 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;etc. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;* Netscape Navigator 4.7 or higher or Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 or 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;higher (important note to AOL users: after connecting to the internet 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;using AOL, you must minimize the native AOL browser and launch one of the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;browsers mentioned herein to connect to your Online Companion Tools) 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;* Mac users are instructed to use Netscape Navigator or Communicator 4.7 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;or higher, rather than using Microsoft Internet Explorer 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;* Make sure that cookies are enabled in the browser you use 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;* Adobe Acrobat Reader 3.0, available at 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;* Macromedia Flash Player 5.0, available at 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;http://www.macromedia.com/downloads 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Depending on your connection speed, downloading new software or software 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;updates can take minutes or hours, so check this all out at least a day 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;prior to when you plan to use the Center first. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Enjoy!
