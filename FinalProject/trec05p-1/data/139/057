Testimonial from Dave F., in Nebraska; First of all, I want to tell you
that I am going to be my own first customer. I won a judgment against a man,
but he closed his shop, took my property and disappeared. Thanks to the
information you gave me, I found him THREE DAYS AFTER RECEIVING YOUR
TRAINING MANUAL. I will use the knowledge gained from you to collect what he
owes me. Thank you again. As far as I'm concerned, your training course has
more than paid for itself already.
