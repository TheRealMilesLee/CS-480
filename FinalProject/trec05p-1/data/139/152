Thanks babe. You are so sweet. I love being with you every day. That is why it is so hard for me when we go a week without being together (real close, that is). I will miss you too. Every time I think of you I will remember the ham (since you don't like them). Talk to you soon.

Love, 
	Steve

It has been great to spend time with you.  I am really going to miss you this week.  I need a kiss before I leave. 
Don't forget to order your ham.

Love you.
