If this is the trade w/ Virginia Power (I am at home on vacation), talk w/ Chris Chang in settlements.  She called me last week and said they were disputing the volume and we agreed to change the trade.  If is not w/ Va. Power, call me at 713-870-8211.

Errol, 

There is an EOL trade that you changed the volume from 2,500/day to 5,000/day.  In EOL, the trade data reads 2,500/day.  Is there a reason for that change?

Thanks, 

Patrick
