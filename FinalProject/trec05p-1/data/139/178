Testimonial from Stan R. Buying your course was one of the best decisions I
have ever made. I'm 48 years old and for the first time in my life I'm at
the right place at the right time. 7 months ago I ran across your web late
one night while surfing the net. I bought the program. I studied it, and put
it to work during the day while keeping my night job. You hear about a lot
of scams on the Internet, but this is no scam. Right now I am making about
$4,500 each month. Not quite $10,000 a month just yet, but at the rate I'm
going it will be just a matter of time before I do. The best part is that I
was able to quit my night job! I thank you.


But I must warn you that in case I find I can not support the weight of
your bodies I shall drop one or both of you into the sea. They looked grave
at this prospect, but the biggest one said: We would soon meet death from
starvation if you left us here on the island; so, as there is at least a
chance of our being able to escape in your company I, for one, am willing to
risk being drowned
It is easier and quicker than being starved
