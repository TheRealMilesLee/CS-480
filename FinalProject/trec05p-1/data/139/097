Have we received executed confirms from Reliant and/or Bank of Montreal for the ring trades?

I have left Diane Anderson on the Confirm Desk a voice mail as to status.  Will let you know what she says.

Marie:

Can you please check on the status of the confirmations for the Reliant/Bank of Montreal Ring Trades.  Please confirm that the confirmations have been reissued and ask to be informed immediately when we receive executed copies back from the counterparties.  This is a big transaction and we need to make sure that we get the confirms signed, sealed and delivered as soon as possible!

Thanks for your help with this.

Leslie
