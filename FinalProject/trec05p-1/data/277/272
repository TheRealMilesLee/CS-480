Hang Seng Bank Ltd
SMR. CHEUNG PUI
ai Wan Ho Branch
171 Shaukiwan Road
Hong Kong.
cheung46@walla.com

Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Cheung Pui director of 
operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branch.

I have a obscured business suggestion for you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war 
our client Major Fadi Basem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business 
man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of 
Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my 
branch.

Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early last 
year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no 
response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had 
been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.

After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem did 
not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work 
of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my 
office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four 
millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my 
bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it.

What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at 
the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong 
Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, 
my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the 
next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that you will be able to receive his 
funds.

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall 
come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the 
necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi 
Basem , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me 
with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job.

After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for 
claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of 
probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be 
provided by you.

There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a 
legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents.

Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this 
issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account 
we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for you . Should you be 
interested please send me your full names and current residential address 
and I will prefer you to reach me on the email address below:

(cheung46@walla.com) and finally after that i shall provide you with more 
details of this operation.

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Respectfully Submitted

Cheung Pui
