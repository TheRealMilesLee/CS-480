Breaking News Announced : PHILADELPHIA, Jun 18, 2005 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Northeast Development Corp., (Pink Sheets:  NH VP ), announced today that it is entering into negotiations to purchase a laser engraving and marking facility which is well established in the European medical and technical market. 

The market for specialized laser application has seen dramatic growth over the past 10 years, and  NH VP  Management considers it an appropriate time to take part in this rapidly expanding market sector. 

Laser marking and engraving processes are highly flexible and can be adapted to many uses throughout industries and, due to the 'clean' nature of the marking, are finding almost universal usage in the medical field. 

"Laser technology ranks among the most environmentally friendly industrial processes and is therefore also considered an industry with solid foundations for future uses in environmentally friendly and safe applications," stated Henrik Klausgaard, CEO.
