Yes way too high for a diesel that has a bad reputation.

The guys here think they can come up with a pair of Cummins for about
$4,500 (for both).

I'll give Ricky a call.

Joe,

The guys who teach auto for us said that if I do have to go with gas,
that the 502 is a much "healthier" engine than the 454.  Any idea of the
cost of 502's?

Thanks

Diesel Engine  $ 6275.00

454 Engine  $ 3350.00

These are your cost.
