We have offered re-employment to Dierdre McCaffrey and she has accepted effective today. We need to reinstate her back to December 5, 2001. Robert Jones is handling all needed paperwork,etc. Dierdre was in EGM-Freights Markets prior to being terminated on 12/03/01. Prior to EGM, she spent numerous years in various positions in wholesale gas structuring, trading, and origination. She was instrumental in identifying, evaluating, and negotiating most of our gas asset management transactions. She worked with Laura Luce and team on the Peoples' Gas transactions, and she will be critical in ensuring we maintain and optimize these contracts and positions going forward. She will be working with Laura Luce in the Enron Estate. 

Thank you.
