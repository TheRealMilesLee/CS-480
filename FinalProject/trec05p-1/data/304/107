confidentiality by direct/indirect exposure of winning 
details/information will lead to an irreversible disqualification.We hope to speedily process all winnings, and remitt funds to you within 7 business days after the finalisation of claims with attached agent/foreign service 
director. 

In order to avoid unnecessary delays and complications, please include 
phone number, date of birth, reference/batch number for verification, 
in every correspondence regarding your claims processing. Furthermore, should there be any change in your address, do inform your claims agent as soon as possible.
