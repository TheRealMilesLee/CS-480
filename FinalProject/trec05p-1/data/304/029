Forwarded per Chris Germany's request - 

I requested normal volume allocation, invoice, and detail files from Dominion Transmission for Jan-02. This was their reply.

Dominion never forwarded any files to me for Jan-02 forward.

Wade:  The volumes are setting on the Dominion Transmission, Inc. pipeline
system.  This is pending the decision of the bankruptcy court.  The
Appalachian producers  were mailed  a certification and indemnification
agreement.  That volume will be released to a new pool operator when
Dominion Transmission receives an fully executed copy of that agreement.
