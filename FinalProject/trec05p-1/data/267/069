Oretech is poised to make huge profits in the booming mining industry.  
If you have been following the markets lately, then you know that 
mining stOcks are HOT.  Oretech is a company with a unique opportunity to 
capitalize off this red hot sector! 

The company has developed and tested their ore processing technology 
that utilizes a proprietary high temperature technique to extract 
specific minerals (gold and silver) from ore bodies. Unlike conventional 
processes ORTE does NOT use harmful chemicals, discharge polluted water or 
environmentally unsafe gases. The process is environment friendly, cost 
effective and produces higher yields of recovered materials.
                 


***TOP REASONS TO CONSIDER ORTE***


* ENVIRONMENTAL CLEAN UP – This sector would pay ORTE to clean up old 
mining waste tailing piles that are leaching poisons into surrounding 
ground water. Revenues are enhanced by selling recovered precious metals. 

* EXTRACT 1OO% OF THE CRUDE OIL FROM TAR SANDS – Tests demonstrate ORTE 
producing TWICE the yields of conventional methods. This application 
has significant potential that would produce new immense investment 
interest in ORTE stOck.

* ORTE CAN RAPIDLY GENERATE REVENUES and corporate growth by licensing 
their technology to equipment manufacturers, mining companies, oil 
companies and Joint Venture partners. This would give ORTE upfront revenues 
and royalty income, industry and investment attention and favorable 
news.

* RECENTLY DISCOVERED OPPORTUNITY – ORTE has developed, tested and 
proven the effectiveness of their technology. Companies dealing in mining 
and oil recovery, tailings waste cleanup, and environmental clean up 
know about ORTE and the effectiveness of their breakthrough process. The 
company is now set to go into a stage of explosive business expansion. 
This should generate the type of Wall Street investment attention that 
would quickly drive share prices upward.

Oretech is set to produce some BIG NEWS on new business and technology 
licensing Joint Ventures that could send share prices soaring.


 
HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:


COLUMBUS, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 3, 20O5--Oretech, Inc. (Pink 
Sheets:ORTE - News) CEO, H. Stephen Shehane, announced today that the 
company has completed the move to its new facilities. The Lab is in full 
operation and producing better than anticipated results. Shehane stated 
that initial results indicate significantly improved performance in two 
specific areas: 

a. ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY: 

Toxic chemicals normally found in mine tailings are significantly 
eliminated during the Oretech's process of precious metals extraction 
(Gold/Silver/Titanium/Platinum).  The SPS (Shehane Proprietary System) 
technology can provide one of the most environmentally friendly mining 
solutions, while being extremely cost effective. 

b. REDUCED ENERGY COSTS: 

With energy costs ever increasing, the reduction in energy consumption 
utilizing SPS technology significantly lowers operating costs 
associated with precious metal extraction. 
Shehane announced that discussions are intensifying with mining 
companies with a view to licensing SPS technology particularly for mining 
operations in environmentally sensitive regions of North America.
