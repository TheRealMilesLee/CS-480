Thread-Topic: Bridgeline Distribution List for Email
Thread-Index: AcHkt03as2cMHLDnS9qJOMjDEYCf1g==
From: "Stipelcovich , Bert" <Bert.Stipelcovich@bridgeline.net>

A new distribution list has been created in the Global Address List for Bridgeline. In fact, it was used to send this email.  :-)
 
It is named "DL-Bridgeline List" and is available for selection from the Global List. We requested the name "Bridgeline" but Enron email protocol require the present format for new distribution lists.
 
The list includes all Bridgeline personnel and will be kept current by Laura or myself.
 
Thanks,
