As Steve Cooper indicated in the employee meeting, we are undertaking efforts to improve the work environment at Enron.  Two such initiatives are being kicked off next week.

First, employees will be able to reinstate I.D. badge purchase privileges.  Beginning Tuesday, April 16, 2002, current Houston-based Enron employees will be able to activate their employee I.D. badge to make purchases at the Energizer, Express Store, and the Plaza Java Coffee kiosk.  Charges will be deducted directly from their paycheck.

To activate your I.D. badge for purchases, please follow the steps outlined below:  
·	Complete a new I.D. badge charge form.  Forms may be picked up at any cash register in the Energizer, Express Store, and Plaza Java.  A printable form is attached below for your convenience.  
·	Sign and date the form.  Doing so authorizes Payroll to deduct charges from your semi-monthly paychecks.  Unsigned and undated forms will be returned to the applicant.  
·	Return the form to Richard Hensch at EB1653a, or to any cashier at the above locations.
·	Allow three days for activation.  

Additionally, there is good news for coffee drinkers.  Beginning Monday, April 15, the operating hours for the Plaza Java coffee kiosk will be extended to 4:00 p.m. for a two-week trial basis.  During that time, participation will be monitored to determine whether the later closing time will be continued.

Questions may be referred to mailto:Richard.Hensch@enron.com.
