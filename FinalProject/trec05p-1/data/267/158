ATTN: MY BELOVED ONE 

How are you and your family today my dear ?It is my
pleasure to write and inform you of this mutual and heartly
help that requires our trust and understanding.Before now I
have given some of friends that are feeling my condition in
their heart your address to contact you for me,have you
received their message?Reference to esteem recommendation
of your trustworthiness,honesty and transparency of your
integrity I received from my late husband's friend. 

First of all let me introduce myself to you,I am PAULINE
BOATENG(MRS)the wife of late MR BUWAZA BOATENG who died in
the recent DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO(DRC)WAR.My husband
was a Minister for Commerce Industreis and Developments in
the government of out stead late President KABILA. My
husband was given the sum of US$30 million (Thirty million
united states of American dollars)to develop Public Liabity
Companies for the country few days before the Rebels came
to fight.They demanded for the money from my husband but he
refused,they killed him and my elder son whom they accused
of hiding the money. 

My dear , with the help of Red Cross Society of Congo,we
carried the money across our national boundary down to my
present hiding place where I and two of my children are now
as refugees. I have since deposited the money in GALLANT
TRUST SECURITY Company for safe keeping as I could not meet
up with the bank requirements for opening an account. I
write you for your assistance to bring the money over to
your country where we can settle and you direct us to
invest the money in a profitable venture. 

Should you be kind enough to help us, you will take 30% of
the total money for your help. Please write us a letter of
acceptance today with your detail contact because we are
suffering here. Please our prayers is that you will be kind
enough to help so that bwe will go out from this suffering
refugee camp.PLEASE BE KIND. 

I am are thanking you with every hope that you will help me
and my children.
