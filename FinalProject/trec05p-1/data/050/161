FYI - these reccomendations all look reasonable to me.

Greg, please have someone in your group formalize a policy type document with timelines, responsible parties, etc. for this.  I believe that I sent you Stacey's original communication.

Tom looked over these procedures today, but he did not have many comments.
I think the procedures should have timing requirments and documentation
requirements.  Here are some of my thoughts:
   Required communication of accrual transactions on date of execution
   Notification of accrual transactions to Financial Operations and Risk
   Controls via deal tickets, deal confirmations, deal "write-ups", etc.
   Required deal "write-up" explaining transaction purpose and basis for
   accrual accounting (this would not be the full blown 133 documentation
   that Financial Operations would prepare)
   Daily DPR should be provided to John Lavorato and/or Wes Colwell
   Weekly/Monthly DPR should be provided to Financial Operations and Market
   Risk Management (this will help RAC implement the risk policy)
   The last point in Stacey's email states that Fin Ops will communicate
   disclosures to Risk Mgmt. - I think Risk Mgmt. should assist Fin Ops. in
   gathering necessary disclosure data
   The procedures need to specify the level of individual that will be
   notified of the accrual transactions

These are just some items I thought through.  I did not go over these
specifically with Tom, but I think he would be supportive of all of these
items.  Let me know what you think.
