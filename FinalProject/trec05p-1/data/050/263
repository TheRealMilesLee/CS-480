    In an effort to honor America and the President's National Day of Prayer and Remembrance, we will have a special time for prayer that will be lead by  Chaplain Ric Walters who is the spiritual director of Clarewood House.  Prior to joining Clarewood House, Chaplain Walters spent 24 years in our nation's active and reserve forces.  Thus the West Point luncheon scheduled for this Friday, Sept 14th at 11:30 a.m. is still on and I look forward to seeing you there!  All the best,  Jon E. King '65 President WPSGH  <http://www.wpsgh.org>


 
The West Point Society of Greater Houston Cordially Invites You to Join Us at Our Monthly Luncheon 
this FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 2001 @ Noon

Please mark your calendars and RSVP Now to Ms. Marsha Winkler at 713 942-7775 and or Jon King at 713 981-9595 and plan to join us for our first fall luncheon on FRIDAY, September 14, 2001 at Noon at Brennan's Restaurant, conveniently located on the edge of downtown Houston at 3300 Smith Street. 

This month's program will feature a very timely talk by a fascinating speaker, Professor Michael Economides, whose topic is, The First Energy Crisis of the Twenty First Century. 

By way of brief background, our speaker is the Author of a new book titled The Color of Oil - The History, Money and Politics of the World's Biggest Business. He is Professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of Houston and a technical advisor to national oil companies. Professor Economides has co-authored 7 textbooks and more than 150 journal papers and articles. He recently co-authored a paper titled: "U.S. National Energy Policy and the Role of Ultra-Deepwater". We hope that you will join us as this promises to be a very enlightening presentation by a very popular speaker on a topic that is critically important to both our local and national economies.

The cost for our Brennan's three course meal is $25.00 per person (which includes tax, & gratuity). 
We look forward to seeing you next Friday, September 14, 2001.
