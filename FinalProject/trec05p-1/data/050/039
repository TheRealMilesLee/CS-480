Kay,

Here's the Term Sheet for the Cogentrix deal.  Hopefully, this will help you draft an appropriate EEI.  Kayne asked me to tell you that this deal would be quite similar to the deal with Mobile and the Alamac plants, so you should be able to use similar templates.

Please feel free to give me a holler with any questions or comments.  Once again there is a sense of urgency on their side to get this done ASAP, as their contract expires 10/2001.  Thanks for looking at this on a short notice...our coordination has suffered due to the ghastly events in NY and Washington.

Regards,
Rahil
