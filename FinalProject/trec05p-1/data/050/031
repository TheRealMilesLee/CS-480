Dear Sir,

I personally decided to put in writing as below, the full details of the
business proposal i have been trying to expleain to you.

I have a profiling amount in an excess of US$183.5M, which I seek your
partnership in accommodating for me. I am willing to give out 25% of this total
sum to you for your quick assistance and partnership. However, I sincerely seek
your confidence in this transaction, which I propose to you as a TOP SECRET.

My name is Robert Bada, i am the personal assistance to the former President of
Republic of Liberia (President Charles Taylor). You most be aware that Charles
Taylor has been fighting serious civil war with the Liberia United for the
Restoration of Democracy (LURD) for quite some years now. And LURD were backed
all along by some foreign powerful countries. Not quite long ago, the American
government ordered President Charles Taylor to leave Liberia or be forced out
of power. Knowing fully well the capabilities of America and other powerful
members of the United Nations, President Charles Taylor decided on the 11th of
August 2003 to go into exile in a neighboring country Nigeria to seek asylum.
Fro more information please read the BBC News on the matter.
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2986926.stm

Based on these developments, his various foreign bank accounts have been frozen
and some are still under serious investigation. But in the light of all these
sad happenings, President Charles Taylor was able, through the help of some
loyalist succeeded to secretly move the sum of US$183.5M, on my name as the
owner to a private security company vault in Nigeria where the final crediting
is expected to be carried out later. All the depositing documents of the above
fund were on my name and they are still in my possession

YOUR ROLE:
All I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum and I
will arrange for the documentation which will enable the Security Company
transfer / wire the fund to your bank account. I have decided to do this only
with you and use this sum to relocate to European or American continent and
never to be connected to any of President Charles Taylor’s conglomerates. This
transaction can be concluded in 2 weeks.

URGENT:
Your response is needed. I want you to call me on 234 1 7239352 for more
directives information and the next step. PLEASE REPLY me only to these my
private email address: robertbada1@carptoheaven.com and brobert@wooow.it,

Please keep this confidential and write back promptly, send me your private
telephone number so i can give you a call immediately for more information, I
look forward to it.  As soon as I get your positive response, I will send you
more details.

Best regard

Mr Robert Bada
