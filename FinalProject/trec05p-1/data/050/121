Kevin,

Yes, Arizona does have an Energy Coordinator in the Governor's Office.  His name is Craig Marks and he is the guy that I've made contact with to whom I sent our Open Season announcement and earlier this week, our press release.  Craig is also the person recommended by Corp. Gov't Affairs as a key contact in the Gov's office.  Evidently this is the person they have dealt with in regard to deregulation, etc. 

Glen

Glen, 
	see note and link below.  The report on the link is only 5 pages and makes some really good recommendations on what states should do to coordinate info and policy on pipeline construction in their state.  Does AZ have a coordinator for pipe activity?  Does the AZ governor have an energy liason with whom we can coordinate?

thanks
kh

 John, the attached link contains a report developed by the IOGCC and Nat'l Association of Regulatory Utility Commissions on ways gas pipeline sponsors can work with state and local interests to improve pipeline certification.  This link was published in the trade rag Inside FERC today.

regards,
