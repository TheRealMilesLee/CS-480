A TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES 

 This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing. 

America: The Good Neighbor. 

Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable 
editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television 
commentator. What follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as 
printed in the Congressional Record:
