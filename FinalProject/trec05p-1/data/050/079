Esmerelda - 

Please set up a meeting on Thursday, 9/13 with the "cc's" to this memo to discuss next steps with some of our CA contracts.

If I have missed anyone who should be there, please make sure they are invited.

Probably need 1 hour.

Thanks - Dan

In addition, though we are still attempting to confirm, it appears that no windfall profits tax bills will make it through the Legislature.  Will report back as soon as we know one way or the other.

Best,
Jeff
