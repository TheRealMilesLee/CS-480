Barry,
Here you go! As long as you guys are just using this as a template, then it should be o.k. If you are using the numbers to value deals, you may want to verify them as there are a few pipes that I haven't updated in a while.

Are you looking after the transportation / tariff file.... If so, can you send me a copy of this file.

We are or may be building a tariff ( book ) for our West Gas Orig desk and I keep telling them I want to look like the canadian version... 

Thanks in advance.
