Greetings Evening MBAs!

Sign up for one of the most worthwhile organizations at Haas.
Join Challenge for Charity TODAY!

WHAT IS CHALLENGE FOR CHARITY?
Challenge for Charity (otherwise known as C4C), is our official 
philanthropic endeavor where Haas, along with 5 other major west coast 
business schools, raises money for Special Olympics.  Haas' chapter of C4C 
donates significant sums of money and volunteer hours to Special Olympics 
every year. In previous years we've raised as much as $70,000 for Special 
Olympics and we hope that this year will be just as successful!!!

C4C is one of the largest organizations at Haas and plays a major role in 
organizing almost all of the most popular student functions including the 
Halloween Ball, Ski Weekend, Charity Auction, Talent Show, Sports Weekend 
at Stanford, and much more.  Stop by our booth at Club Night this Thursday 
9/5 from 5pm to 8pm to get more involved with any of these fantastic events!

WHAT DO I GET WITH MY C4C MEMBERSHIP?
As an Evening MBA student, your C4C membership dues are only $150!  Not 
only does your membership support a fabulous cause, it also entitles you to 
so many great benefits including a really cool new baseball cap and free 
access to some of the most popular social events at Haas!

Ticket prices for non-C4C members typically range about $40 per person for 
EACH of our most popular events. This means that your membership brings you 
a ton of fun at significant savings!  Anyone who has attended any of our 
events can tell you that this is a deal!  So, sign up today!

CAN MY SIGNIFICANT OTHER JOIN C4C TOO?
As you may have noticed, significant others are just as much a part of the 
Haas family as the students, so don't forget your significant other is 
eligible for C4C membership as well. We realize that significant others are 
not always able to attend as many events as Haas students, so significant 
others' membership dues are only $75. That means you and your honey can 
join for a mere $225! If your S.O. can only attend two of our many events, 
it will more than cover the cost of his/her membership!

HOW DO I SIGN UP?
To join C4C, simply submit a check payable to Challenge for Charity 
indicating the name(s) of the new C4C member(s). Please place your checks 
in Linda Ng's mailbox in the MBA Lounge at Haas or stop by the C4C table at 
Club Night this Thursday 9/5 from 5pm to 8pm.  We will also be holding a 
membership drive during the coming weeks, so look for us in the Haas 
courtyard during break.  Remember that membership is only $150 per Haas 
student and only $75 for Haas significant others.

WHAT IF I'M ALREADY A MEMBER?
C4C membership is only for the academic year, so if you joined C4C last 
year, you must sign up again this year. If you've already joined C4C this 
year, you need to pick up your brand-spanking new baseball cap. Please stop 
by the C4C table at Club Night this Thursday or during our membership drive 
at break during the coming weeks.

Thank you for supporting C4C and the Special Olympics!

Sincerely,
Linda Ng & Wendy Hsu
Challenge for Charity Co-chairs
