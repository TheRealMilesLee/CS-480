Here are the things that we need to work on while you are here:

1)   Powder River external pool 12/99, 01/00, 02/00, 03/00    

2)   FUGG Imbalance 12/99 - 07/01  

 3)   PSCO  05/00 imbalance swap

4)     Please take a look at deal #149162 for 10/00.  There is an
              interconnect for 52,221 on the sale for FUGG, but there is 
              nothing on the supply for FUGG.  Should this really be an
              interconnect deal?


5)    Same thing on deal #561930 for 09/00.  There is an interconnect
              for 69,461 on the sale for FUGG, but there is no supply, and the
              deal is set up at the imbalance point.  Should this really be an
              interconnect deal?    

 6)    Crestone draft for 04/01 for contract #96027895, deal #414117.
The rate has been changed from .054032 to .39078.  Is this correct?
The draft is for over ($59,000).

7)    Crestone draft for 10/00 for contract #96041735, deal #423796
for 78,590 dth @ $.65922 for $51,808.10.
