Hey Man!

Just got back from my climbing trip.  Headed out to the Canary Islands for 
10 days then I´ll be coming over to the states on the 21st or so.  Needless 
to say, not going to be able to have you over.  Wish you could have come 
over sooner when Donny and Vinlarek were here it was great.  I´m not going 
anywhwere and will be here next summer and the one afeter that and the one 
after that....  Don´t know when you need to use your vacation time by, but 
maybe we can go sking this winter.

Like I said, I will be in Texas from the 21st to the 1st of October or so, 
then off to Maine to see my aunt.  Hopefully we´ll see each other ( I need 
to get my shit out of your closet and into my storage place anyways!!, 
Thanks and sorry about that!)

Say hi to Zooey for me and see you in a few weeks hopefully.

CAS
