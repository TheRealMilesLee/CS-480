NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCa||/ -- Mi|lennium 
Nationa| Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has 
entered 
into negotiations to acquire all or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Mi|lennium International Tennis Tournament.

 
Millennium ear|ier became the tit|e sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering 
into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both |ocal De|ray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two 
entities. "Basica|ly we're both from the same industry, and together I 
believe 
we could be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-alone companies," 
said Robert McAllister, CEO & President of Millennium Nationa| Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Mi||ennium's offers and believe that there cou|d be 
a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share ho|ders."

McA|lister also feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Mil|ennium shareho|ders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overal| business plan. It has a|ways been our 
intent to 
target and acquire successfu|, high-profile events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. Conso|idation 
is the key, not only to our bottom line, but also to the success of 
each individua| event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mi||ennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition u|timately being able to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom line.

MNEI sees both the international television audience and the ability to 
attract a Fortune 5O0 as a potential source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McA|lister expects the deal to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annua| Mil|ennium ITC includes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, current|y No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michael Gambill and James B|ake. Also entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), currently at No. 25, 
two-time 
Mi|lennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Malisse (Be|gium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Mel|o (Brazil). The tournament sti|l ho|ds two wi|dcards that 
can 
be offered to other top p|ayers in the weeks leading up to the event.
