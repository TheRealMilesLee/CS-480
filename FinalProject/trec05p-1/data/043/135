I'd like to discuss Everett. I have to say I would have put huge money on you telling me to jump in the lake if I had suggested him. If Beth does go I would have thought Anthony would be the more obvious choice. Why is everyone suddenly buying Everett's stock - has Fallon been doing a sales job ?

No idea about Beth - she hasn't come to see me since she got back.  But I think if she does move then Everett is the perfect fit and as that group's customer I'm willing to give it a shot.

Hi Louise,
 
I heard on the grapevine that you might be considering Beth for a commerical role -true or false?
 
I also heard you were interested in Plante as a replacement - true or false?
 
See you soon (I'm in this afternoon after closing on my house).
 
Best Regards
MRP
