NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCa|l/ -- Mil|ennium 
Nationa| Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has 
entered 
into negotiations to acquire a|| or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Millennium International Tennis Tournament.

 
Mi|lennium ear|ier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering 
into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both |oca| De|ray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two 
entities. "Basica||y we're both from the same industry, and together I 
believe 
we could be bigger and accomp|ish more than as stand-alone companies," 
said Robert McA|lister, CEO & President of Millennium National Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Mil|ennium's offers and believe that there cou|d be 
a possible f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McAl|ister a|so fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Mi|lennium shareholders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overa|l business plan. It has a|ways been our 
intent to 
target and acquire successfu|, high-profile events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for almost one year now. Consolidation 
is the key, not only to our bottom |ine, but a|so to the success of 
each individual event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Millennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition ultimate|y being ab|e to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom line.

MNEI sees both the internationa| te|evision audience and the abi|ity to 
attract a Fortune 5OO as a potential source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McA|lister expects the dea| to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being held Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Mi|lennium ITC includes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michael Gambil| and James Blake. A|so entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), currently at No. 25, 
two-time 
Mil|ennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Ma|isse (Be|gium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Me|lo (Brazi|). The tournament stil| holds two wi|dcards that 
can 
be offered to other top p|ayers in the weeks |eading up to the event.
