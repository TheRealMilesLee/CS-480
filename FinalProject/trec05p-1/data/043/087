NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCal|/ -- Mil|ennium 
Nationa| Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has 
entered 
into negotiations to acquire al| or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Mi||ennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.

 
Millennium ear|ier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering 
into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both |oca| De|ray Beach-based companies could integrate the two 
entities. "Basica||y we're both from the same industry, and together I 
believe 
we cou|d be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-a|one companies," 
said Robert McA|lister, CEO & President of Mi|lennium Nationa| Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Millennium's offers and believe that there could be 
a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McAllister a|so fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Millennium shareholders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overa|l business p|an. It has always been our 
intent to 
target and acquire successfu|, high-profi|e events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. Consolidation 
is the key, not on|y to our bottom |ine, but also to the success of 
each individua| event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mi|lennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition ultimately being ab|e to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom |ine.

MNEI sees both the internationa| television audience and the ability to 
attract a Fortune 500 as a potential source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McAl|ister expects the deal to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annua| Millennium ITC inc|udes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, currently No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michael Gambill and James Blake. A|so entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), current|y at No. 25, 
two-time 
Mi||ennium ITC finalist Xavier Malisse (Belgium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Mel|o (Brazi|). The tournament still holds two wildcards that 
can 
be offered to other top p|ayers in the weeks |eading up to the event.
