FROM THE DESK OF MARK ELIS
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
CCTB BANK LONDON-ENGLAND.
PRIVATE EMAIL: mark_ellis791@yahoo.co.uk 


Let me start by introducing myself. I am MR. MARK ELLIS,CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER of the CITY CENTER TRUST BANK.I have an obscured business suggestion for you.

I honestly apologize and hope I did not cause you much embarrassment by contacting you through this means for a transaction of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium, sorry my English is not very good. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client MAJOR FADI EL AMIN who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Ten millions United State Dollars only in 
my branch. Upon maturity several Notices was sent to him,even during the war early this year.

Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.

After further investigation it was also discovered that MAJOR FADI EL AMIN did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Ten millions United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the England Government if nobodyapplies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to MAJOR FADI EL AMIN so that you will be able to receive his funds.


Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for you. Should you be interested please let me know and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation.

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards

MR. MARK ELLIS
