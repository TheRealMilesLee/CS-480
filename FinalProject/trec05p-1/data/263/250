EMPLOYEE NEWS LINE

ENRON POSTS JOBS
The company is reinstituting a job posting process to help fill open positions.  In the midst of restructuring, the number of job openings is understandably limited.   However, postings will be updated regularly.  Within the job posting system called jobOps, an employee can apply for a position by using their current employee profile as their resume or modify it to create an updated resume.  Employee's can still update their profile information in eHRonline.  At this time, only current employees will be able to apply for a position from within jobOps.  You may access current postings by visiting https://hrglobal.enron.com/JobOps.  The system can also be reached by clicking on the jobOps link from http://Home.enron.com or http:hrweb.enron.com.  

COMPANY RESUMES SERVICE AWARDS
Enron has resumed its Service Awards Program to recognize employees' years of service to the organization.  Employees in both debtor and non-debtor companies are eligible to receive service awards upon their employment anniversary every five years.  Employees who are nearing an employment anniversary or passed an anniversary while the program was suspended will soon receive by mail a brochure and order form that allows them to select their individual gift.  The selection of gifts has recently been updated yet still includes favorites such as pen and pencil sets, knives, jewelry or grandfather clocks depending on an employee's years of service to the company.  Service award notification, gift catalogues, and order forms will be available to eligible employees online in the near future.
