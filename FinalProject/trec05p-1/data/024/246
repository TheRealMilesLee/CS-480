           Internet Daily for Friday, August 10, 2001
             by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Web use at four-month low

Is the Internet getting old or is it summer doldrums? Worldwide 
Internet traffic fell to 296.4 million visitors in July, the 
lowest level in the past four months, according to ComScore 
Networks Inc. and Diameter, a division of DoubleClick Inc..

Overall traffic by U.S. visitors declined 1.9% from June to 
July, after a 3% drop from May to June, believed largely to have 
been driven by the end of college sessions, said Doug Knopper, 
general manager of Diameter. "This is probably not something to 
get worried about," he told CBS.MarketWatch.com. "After five 
years of huge growth, you expect a leveling off." Knopper said 
there is evidence the Internet is becoming more important in 
people's lives. "The time spent online is increasing. People are 
spending more time and using it in more effective ways and more 
like traditional forms of media."

He said entertainment Web sites were the most visited category 
for the month, with 72% of Web users hitting a site such as 
Napster.com or Jurassicpark.com.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Flooz.com is a flop

The Internet's version of S&H Green stamps has taken a licking 
and shut down its Web site. Flooz.com created an online currency 
that could be used to make purchases on various sites, including 
Barnesandnoble.com, Outpost and Tower Records. Customers bought 
the currency from Flooz.com and could use it themselves or 
e-mail it to others as a sort of gift certificate. Visitors to 
the site are now greeted by this message: "We are currently 
unable to process your transaction. Check back for further 
updates. We apologize for this inconvenience." The company, 
started by IVillage founder Bob Levitan, is reportedly 
considering ceasing operations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
One-day air sale boosts traffic

Web visits to Travelocity skyrocketed 74% Wednesday, propelled 
by a one-day promotion for American Airlines. Daily traffic to 
Travelocity spiked to 436,000 unique visitors on Wednesday from 
Tuesday, while jumping 45% compared with the previous Wednesday, 
according to audience measurement service Nielsen/NetRatings. 
"One-day promotions can be very effective in attracting 
potential customers as the time sensitive call to action drives 
consumers to respond immediately," said Lisa Strand, director 
and chief analyst at NetRatings. Also Thursday and Friday, 
Orbitz and Expedia mounted promotions with Northwest Airlines.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Online trades off 32%

Ameritrade Holding Corp. reported Friday the daily pace of 
trading last month was down 32% vs. two months earlier. The 
company said it handled 80,000 trades a day last month, while 
the May number was 118,000. Ameritrade said it had 1.554 million 
open accounts at the end of July, an increase of 1.5% from May.
