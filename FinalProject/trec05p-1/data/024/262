Hello to all the new students and welcome back to the rest.
 
*Shuttle Confusion*
Well, looks like there's a bit of confusion out there for those that actually read our back to school packet (which I'm sure was all of you) in regards to the shuttle.  The shuttle pick-up times will remain the same as last semester 4:15pm, not 4:30 or 4:20.  Also, the South Bay Shuttle pick-up location also remains the same, at Our Lady's Way, not S3 Inc. parking lot.
 
Sorry about the confusion.  
 
On a lighter note, the EVENING NEWS is looking for submissions!  So if your exciting life has EVEN MORE exciting events, let us know.  Not only do we want to know about it, but we want to see it too.  So if you have pictures with your submission, that's great.  So you can tell us about recent births, promotions, changes, or even let us know what you did this summer - anything that you want to share with your fellow students.  
 
You can submit your contribution by e-mail (slee@haas), fax (510-643-5901), or regular mail.  It could be written on a paper bag, cocktail napkin, even a palimpsest.  It's all good.  We just want to hear from you about you.
 
Thanks.
