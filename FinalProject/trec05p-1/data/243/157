Joe from GS called me yesterday.  The check was being overnighted to me last night.  Hopefully it will find  me by tomorrow.  I also responded to Bryan.

The check was supposed to be sent to Sheila's attention and Laurel was going to retrieve.

Laurel:  Has the check been received?  If not, would you please follow up with Goldman?
