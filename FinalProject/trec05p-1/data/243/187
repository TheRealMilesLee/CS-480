Shelley,

Please review and make changes to the invitee letter -- this is Ricki's rough draft and right now Ricki has my name and Sheila's name on it, but I think it will seem more substantial to have the letter coming from you, the vice president level. This letter probably needs to go out early next week.

Thanks, Mike
