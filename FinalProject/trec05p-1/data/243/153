Two boys are playing football at a park in Norman, Oklahoma when one of
the boys is suddenly attacked by a crazed Rottweiler.  Thinking quickly,
the other boy takes a stick and shoves it under the dog's collar, twists
it, and breaks the dog's neck, thus saving his friend.  

A sports reporter who was strolling by sees the incident and rushes over to
interview the
boy.  He tells the boy he's going to write the story and says, "I'll title
it 'Young Sooner Fan Saves Friend From Vicious Animal'."

"But I'm not a Sooner fan."  the little hero replies.

"Sorry, since we're in Norman Oklahoma, I just assumed you were," says the
reporter and he starts writing again.
He asks "How does 'Cowboy Fan Rescues Friend From Horrific Attack'
sound?"

"I'm not a Cowboy fan either, "  the boy says.

"Oh, I thought everyone in Oklahoma was either for the Sooners or the
Cowboys.  What team do you root for?"  the reporter asks.

"I'm just visiting my cousin, I'm a Texas Aggie fan," the boy replies.
"They're the best."

The reporter smiles, starts a new sheet in his notebook and writes:
"Little Redneck Bastard From Texas Kills Beloved Family Pet."
