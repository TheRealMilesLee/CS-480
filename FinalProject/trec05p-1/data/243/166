Shelley - The final version is about 3/4s of an inch thick and there is only possibly a single paper version.   A copy was made this morning by George Kneisley in Roswell who headed up our sub-committee.  He is sending it overnight to Ricki Winters to give to you.   This is a much better document than the electronic copy I sent you earlier.   It was put together for Phil Lowery.

Tks - Mike W.

Shelley,  here is a copy of the UAF sub-committee findings and recommendations.   This is the committee I was on for a year.    I really believe this is a good document with a lot of valuable data but it is very large.   MIPS was the GMS system when this was written so many of the reports were MIPs generated.     They are working on reports for PGAS using "Business Objects" and Jodie and I will be receiving some one on one training tomorrow afternoon. 

Tks - Mike W.

Mike, all I have in electronic format is the UAF portion of the report. I couldn't find anything on PPA's.
