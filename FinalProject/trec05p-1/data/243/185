I did get on the list and the info was forwarded to me to print out for him.  He is all set up and will also receive the updates.  Thanks so much for directing me.

Kim, Eric is borrowing Kevin Hyatt's TW Tariffs (small) binder.  He has asked me to try to get one for him.  Does someone supply those or do I just need to have it reproduced for him. 

Thanks!
