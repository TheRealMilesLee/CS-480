Looks fine to me. Do we need to mention North Needles has to fill up first?

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

Let me know your comments.

Thanks!
