Breaking News :

PLANTATION, Fla.,- Dtomi, Inc., a Nevada
corporation ("Dtomi") (DTOI) , announced today
that a prototype of a motorcycle trailer fitted
with its Air Spring Axle(TM) is being evaluated
by a major motorcycle manufacturer.

The Air Spring Axle(TM) is an innovative,
patented suspension that provides the benefits
of an air suspension and also allows a trailer
to be lowered to ground level to simplify
loading and unloading.

John Haddock, CEO of Dtomi said, "We are
obviously very pleased this evaluation is
underway especially as we believe the unique
attributes of the Air Spring Axle(TM) make it
an ideal choice for trailers designed to transport
motorcycles. By eliminating long, steep and narrow
ramps, the Air Spring Axle(TM) makes loading
motorcycles faster, easier and less physically
demanding.

"Each year, over 500,000 motorcycles are sold
with engine capacities greater than 651cc, so
the opportunity is very significant", added
Haddock
