Thanks for your note and support.

The response you received is both incorrect and unacceptable.  I will personally look into this and revert back with a solution.

My sincerest apologies,

George

So, it all came to pass.  Per our discussion a long time ago - I am now having the problems envisaged with ibuyit.  I have never received an approval request from any of my direct reports.  I have contacted the ibuyit team and asked why not?  Has no-one reporting to me ordered anything?  The response from the team was that they were unable to tell me what the issue was and that I should ask each one of my direct reports to look at the system next time and tell me who they were sending their applications to.  The ibuyit administration team cannot assess this information (ISC helpline).

Please help this is very frustrating - I am trying to be pro-active but its hard.
