Dear Michael,

The Lido is a very popular cart. It is a certified electric vehicle (NEV)
and has a lot of style. It is perfect for neighborhood use.

They are available for order and should take 4-6 weeks for delivery.

Regards,

I was curious if any of these LIDOs are selling.  IS there a back order
or do you have a ready supply of them?
