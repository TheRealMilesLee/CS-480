Thanks for the positive feedback - I'm glad everything went well.  When I called Kristen & Rich on Thursday evening - it sounded like everyone was having a grand time!!
Trip to Germany was fun, but hectic.  It's hard to put so much into only 10 days.
Looking forward to handling your next event (and this time I'll make sure I'm in town).
By the way - how did the videos turn out??
