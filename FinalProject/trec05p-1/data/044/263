The prehearing conference in the CA case was an interesting proceeding.  It became very apparent that the ISO was primarily responsible for the delay in producing data.  The parties complained that they had not received what the ISO had promised.  The PX complained that they had received NO reliable data from ISO (it was riddled with errors) and that they were at the same point as at the beginning of the entire proceeding.  The PX needs the ISO data in order to commence generating the data that the PX itself needs to produce.  In any event, the new, delayed schedule is a positive development.  It is noteworthy that we were able to group consideration of refunds issues and offsets to refunds on the same date- October 26 (previously refund testimony was considered first, and testimony related to possible offsets to refunds was considered on a subsequent date).  This is very positive since it reduces the chance that the proceeding will be only about refunds and that the offsets issue will be marginalized.  Ray Alvarez

The DC Team (Linda Robertson, Ray Alvarez) attended and reported on today's prehearing conference in the California case.  The schedule has moved back about a full month mostly due to the time required by PX and CAISO to produce mitigated market clearing prices and to re-run settlements based on those revised prices.  Testimony by Enron on what it is owed is now not due until October 26.  In addition to adopting this schedule, the ALJ reported that the FERC likely not rule on petitions for rehearing of the July 25 order until October 15, 2001.

A revised schedule is attached.  (To see how it has changed, you can toggle Track Changes | Hightlight on Screen on and off)

The PNW case is moving along on schedule; changes attached are corrections rather than actual changes to the schedule.  Notably in today's case, Seattle and Tacoma waived all cross on TFG witnesses, including Enron's.
