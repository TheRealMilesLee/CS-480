Jean felt free to come over to my area (on 31 now) and make fun of me in front of my new Director and VP!  Then she proceeded to brag about her new Mercedes S500, it was pretty classic Mrha.

John,  Why don't we meet around 6:30 pm.  How about Two Rows in the Village?  If you don't like, I am open to suggestions.

Jean wrote me a sarcastic/funny email that I'll tell you about.  I do finally have a phone though…

Beer/dinner sounds great for Sunday evening.  Let me know what time you'll be back in town and where you want to meet.

Hey Dude,  Do you have a phone yet?  Jean would have never let that happen.  I am actually going to Austin this weekend.  I should be back Sunday afternoon sometime.  We could grab a beer and some dinner Sunday evening. Let me know.

Gerald -

Well, I don't have a monitor or a working phone, but other than that everything is going well in my new group.

Do you have plans this Sunday afternoon/evening?  If not, are you interested in grabbing a few beers or something?  My wife is going out of town on business so I won't have anything to do….

JK
