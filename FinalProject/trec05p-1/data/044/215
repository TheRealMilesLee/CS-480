From: Mr.William Winpoe
Good day,
Conpliment of the day and happy New Year to you and your family, and I
do hope this letter will not be a surpise to you. My name is MR.
WILLIAM WINPOE from Liberia,the elderest
son to Mr.John.Y.Winpoe Former Deputy Minister of
National Security in Liberia in West Africa.
My father was falsely accused of plotting to remove
the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA (CHARLES TAYLOR) from
office. Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him.You
can verify this from LIBERIAN EMBASSY in your country.
You can also check in some of the international
newspapers posted in the
web sites below:
http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-07-15-liberia_x.htm
http://www.unwire.org/UNWire/20030716/449_6621.asp
Before he was killed, my father instructed me to
escape with the family
to a hide out in BENIN REPUBLIC,another Country in
West African and he
confirmned to me that he left some money in a Diplomatic
Trust Company, (name
withheld for security reasons) he handed me over a
certificate meant for a
secret Deposit, which he made in the Security Company.
If you may ask why do I need a foreign assistance or
why can't I take the cash transfer myself? The answer is that there was
an exclusion
clause in the original
agreement between the company and my father which
states unambiguously
that 'nobody,not even himself, can have access to the
consignment in the
company, and it has to be transferred to a foreign
beneficiary outside
Africa. This was done because he envisaged his arrest
and this clause were
inserted to prevent any seizure or infiltration of the
fund.
My decision to contact you is therefore, informed by
this and due to my
present social status and total ignorance of the
business world.I believe
you will appreciate the enormity of trust I repose on
you by contacting you unbehalf of my family. Permit me to
request that you should
reassure me that you would not let me down in any way.
On my part, this is
my assurance and guarantee to you. I have
contacted the Diplomatice
Security Firm to confirm the deposit, which is worth
US$18
Million, (Eighteen Million United States dollars)
which I presumed my
father made from the purchase of arms and ammunitions
for the Liberia
Army.
Presently I am now in Europe as a refugee and under the refugee law I
cannot involve in a hunge amount of money transaction which I search for
a reliable
person/company of high intergrity to assist claim this fund on our
behalf
as the beneficiary,and we have agreed to give you 25%
of the total sum as commission for your
assistance/effort. We will use
50% to invest in south-east asia where earthquake happened recently or any of =
your recommendations and guide into Joint venture
business with you,20% for my family use.
I would greatly appreciate your assistance as I look
foward to your quick reply through my private email
address
.
Yours Faithfully,
Mr.William Winpoe
For the Family.
