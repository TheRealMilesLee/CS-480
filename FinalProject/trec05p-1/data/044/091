    We have an open house at West U around 5 on Thursday....should last around an hour. I could go after that. We have a soccer game on Friday night....when is yours this week? We could go to skeeters with the kids after the game and I could send Bill and Cal to hit golf balls or play pool. Next week I am pretty flexible......class on Monday night but could do Tuesday. Wed. of course is soccer practice for all.....could go to skeeters with the kids after practice next Wednesday.
    Let me know what works for you.
    Marsha

              We convince ourselves that life will be better, after we 
              get married, have a  baby, then, another. 

              Then, we are frustrated that the kids aren't old enough, and, 
              we'll be more content when they are. 

              After that, we're frustrated that we have teenagers to deal with. 
              We will, certainly, be happy when they are out of that stage. 

              We tell ourselves that our life will be complete, when our spouse 
              gets his or her act together, when we get a nicer car, we are able 
              to go on a nice vacation, or, when we retire. 

              The truth is, there's no better time to be happy, than right now. 
              If not now, when? 

              Your life will, always, be filled with challenges. 
              It's best to admit this to yourself and decide to be happy, anyway. 
              Happiness is the way. 

              So, treasure every moment that you have and treasure it more, because 
              you shared it with someone special, special enough to spend your time 
              with... and, remember, that time waits for no one. 

              So, stop waiting.... 

              - until your car or home is paid off 
              - until you get a new car or home 
              - until your kids leave the house 
              - until you go back to school 
              - until you finish school 
              - until you lose 10 pounds 
              - until you gain 10 pounds 
              - until you get married 
              - until you get a divorce 
              - until you have kids 
              - until you retire 
              - until summer 
              - until spring 
              - until winter 
              - until fall 
              - until you die 

              There is no better time, than right now, to be happy. 
              Happiness is a journey, not a destination. 

              So, work like you don't need money, 
              Love like you've never been hurt, 
              And dance like no one's watching.
