Mr. Taylor, 
The EnronOnline Call Center recently received a call from Colby Ketler with Duke Energy regarding EnronOnline's new functionality.  Mr. Ketler was under the impression that we are posting or matching his prices on our website.  I explained to him that all prices listed on EnronOnline were Enron's prices.  He was interested in more detailed information than I was able to provide.  I did take his contact information and assured him that an EnronOnline representative would call him shortly and provide the information he requested.  His phone number is 713-989-0180.  If you need to reach me, please contact me at 5-3558.
