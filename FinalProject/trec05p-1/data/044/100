Below are the arrival and departure dates that I have reserved for you at the San Luis Resort in Galveston for the 2nd Annual Accounting Leadership Conference.

	Arrival				Departure
	9/19				9/21


The 2nd Annual Accounting Leadership Conference has been scheduled for September 20-21, 2001 at the San Luis Resort in Galveston.   In addition to communication and networking, this year the focus of the conference will be on leadership:
	refining the direction and objectives for Global Accounting
	defining and agreeing on priorities
	improving leadership skills 

In addition, the format of the conference has changed from last year.
  
The conference will be more participatory.  While there will be a few speakers/presentations, you will spend more time in working sessions focused on the topics above. 

The meeting will begin at 9AM on Thursday.  The meeting should adjourn by 3:00 on Friday.  There is no organized dinner or activity for Wednesday night.

The San Luis Resort is located at 5222 Seawall Boulevard, Galveston, Texas.
