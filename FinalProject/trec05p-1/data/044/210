Bill And Exchange Manager

Dear Friend,
(Assure  Me Your Rediness)

I am Dr Issa Abdoul the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remit=
tance
Department of (International Bank of Africa(IBA).) I am writing to seek
your intrest over a transaction. In my department we discovered an abando=
ned
sum of $1.7m(One Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollar) .In an account th=
at
belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire fam=
ily
in November 2001 in a plane crash.Since we got information about his Deat=
h,
we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money
because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of ki=
n
or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but un=
fortunately
we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside wi=
th
him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. 

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my depa=
rtment
now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money
to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subs=
equent
disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to=

go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guidelin=
e
here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after Five years,
the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.Th=
e
request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the=

fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Benin Indigine cannot stand
as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be
for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign acco=
unt,
10 % will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60
% would be for me and my colleagues. 

There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement
according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate=

transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the ban=
k
as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, yo=
ur
bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and
effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.=


Upon receipt of your reply or your telephone call, I will send to you by
fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to you=
r
notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entert=
ain
any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the tran=
sfer
.
 
You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.Hopi=
ng
for a very successful business relationship with you.

Yours faithfully,

Dr Issa Abdoul.
