It's an old dog for a hard road. 



The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. . The nearer the bone the sweeter the meat. . To look as if butter will not melt in his mouth. . Where observation is concerned, chance favours only the prepared mind. .
It's all in a days work. 

Honesty is the best policy. 

no more?

.At a round table there's no dispute about the place. . The early bird gets the worm. . Every man is the architect of his destiny. .
The harder you work, the luckier you are. . Beggars can't be choosers. . You never know what you can do till you try. .

He who hesitates is lost. . Step by step one goes far. . Don't go off half-cocked. .
