Would you know, or do you know who would know, whether ENA serves any end use customers off of Southwest Gas's system in Nevada?  We have a case before the Nevada PUC where SW Gas is trying to force transportation customers who return to sales service to sign up for a minimum term of 5 years and then to give one year's notice before they can return to transportation.  Some customers went back to sales because of delivery and pricing problems last winter, so it became an issue (although most of those customers only had to sign up for 1 year of sales).
