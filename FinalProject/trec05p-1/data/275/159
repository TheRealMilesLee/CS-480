"What I like best is a book that's at least funny once in a while... what really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it.  That doesn't happen much, though.  -- J.D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye",
"Monogamy is the Western custom of one wife and hardly any mistresses.  -- H.H. Munro, the short story genius known as Saki",
"With our combined strength we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.  -- Darth Vader",
"We must view young people not as empty bottles to be filled, but as candles to be lit.  -- Robert H. Shaffer",
"Never ask what sort of computer a guy drives. If he's a Mac user, he'll tell you. If not, why embarrass him?  -- attributed to Tom Clancy",
"Did you know that blonde as in person only dates to 1822?  -- Rohit Khare",
"How does one go about shaving a yak?  Doesn't he mind?", "We're not worthy!  We're not worthy!  -- Wayne's World",
"Jack Kerouac would have tossed him from a speeding vehicle.  -- Tom Gliatto",
"As soon as we get good at handling the impossible, it becomes part of our job description.  -- Colonel Egan, USMC",
