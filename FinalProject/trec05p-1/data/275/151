Dear Sir,
URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL
It is my great pleasure in writing you this letter on behalf of my 
colleagues. Your particulars were given to me by a member of the South 
Africa Export Promotion Council (S.E.P.C) who was with the federal 
government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition. I have 
decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the 
deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will 
keep it as top secret because of the nature of this business.

I am ENGR.GEORGE KWATATA, Director Of Project Implementation, South Africa 
Department of Minerals & Energy I am making this contact with you, based on 
the committee's need for an Individual/company who is willing to assist us 
in the execution of this business. Within the Department of Minerals & 
Energy, where I work as a Director of the Project Implementation and with 
the good co-operation of four other top officials, we have in our possession 
as over due payment bills, totaling Twenty One Million, Five Hundred 
Thousand United States Dollars (US$21,500,000) Which we want to transfer 
abroad with the assistance and co-operation of A Foreign Company/individual 
to receive the said funds on our behalf. More so, we are handicap in these 
circumstances, as the South African Civil Services code of conduct does not 
allow us to operate an offshore account. Hence your importance in this 
transaction.

This amount $21.5Million represents the balance of the total contract value 
executed on behalf of my ministry by a Foreign Contracting Firm, which we 
the Officials over invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost 
has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of 
the said amount, which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key 
Tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T). to any Foreign Bank Account you will 
provide by filing an Application through the Ministry Of Justice here in 
South Africa, for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former 
contractor to you.

I have the Authority of my partners involved to propose that you should be 
willing to assist us in this transaction, your share of the sum is 30% of 
the $21.5Million, 60% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses 
and remaining 5% will be for charity organization. The transaction it self 
is 100% safe, on your part provided you treats it with utmost secrecy and 
confidentiality. Also, your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the 
successful execution of this transaction.  I have reposed my confidence in 
you and hope that you will not disappoint me. I want to assure you that my 
partner and myself are in the position to make the payment of this claim 
possible, provided that you can give us a very strong assurance and 
guarantee that the funds will be secured and please, remember to treat this 
matter very confidential, because we will not comprehend with any form of 
exposure as we are still in active Government service. Please, reply me on 
my confidential email address: georgekwatata1977@zwallet.com  or call / fax 
your response directly to my. Tel:  27-73-5714080 OR Fax No.:27-11-507 6944. 
  Once again, remember that time is of great essence in this transaction.  I 
wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.  Thank you for your 
co-operation.


Yours Faithfully,
ENGR. GEORGE KWATATA
