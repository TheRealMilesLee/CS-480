I have called a few people and found that the estate team will be supporting you.  I forwarded your phone number and let them know to get this done ASAP.  You should get a call soon.


Good luck,
Daniel

Daniel, I rebooted and CQG is not there. Will I have to reinstall? and How do I do that? Will it be back in the morning?

Please reboot your machine at the end of the day today.  Otherwise you will have problems with your CQG in the morning.
If this will be a problem, please reply and we will find a workaround.


Thanks for you help.

The following people have been migrated to the new CQG infrastructure but have not logged out.  Could you have someone in desktop support, visit these users and have them logout after trading today.

Thanks,

Danielle
