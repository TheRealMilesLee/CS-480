C'mon you can play 18 then do housework all afternoon.  If you're just starting you don't get many invitations!  Truthfully, I'm usually napping after golf, you're always surprised how tired you get after 18 holes!

I've gotten some interest from various groups within EES, EGM and hopefully Industrial Markets, but it's tough.  Everybody is cautious, nobody's going gangbusters.  I've been pounding the pavement almost full time for 2 weeks.  Need to close something before heading back to Seoul.  I brought my family back to Houston and they're staying, but I'll head back to Seoul in a week or 2.

p.s.  thanks for your lead on Mike Curry, but he had just hired a manager so nothing for now.

I'd like to but i'm tied up doing house stuff all day.  Have you found a group in Houston?
How's the search going?  Tell Matt I said hi.

Kevin,
I'm back in town.  Matt and I plan to play golf this Saturday morning.  I understand you're a budding golfer.  Care to join us?
