  </strong><span class="style18"><strong>Shakespeare probably said it best:
"Know thyself, and it shall follow as the night the day, that thou canst not
then be false to any man." <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But how well do any of us actually know ourselves?
How many of us know ourselves well enough to know exactly how we will react
in any given situation? Very few. Because most of us have not formed
concrete opinions on many aspects of life, we only decide how to react to a
situation either when that situation suddenly comes upon us, or after it has
passed. Isn't it far better to know how you will react to a situation
<em>before </em> that situation arises? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the first of the two purposes of this book. <br>
  <br>
&nbsp; Self-discovery means power. When you've examined your inner self so
thoroughly that you know exactly what your beliefs are and how you will
react in almost any given situation, you will have developed a powerful
self-esteem which will guide you confidently through life. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To reach this envious goal, follow these steps: <br>
  <br>
• &nbsp; Select the chapters or questions which are of particular
importance or interest to you. <br>
  <br>
• &nbsp; Dating your entry, use the ruled area below the question to write
in your answer. Before writing, think through your answer clearly, examining
the question from all sides, then answer as truthfully as you possibly can.
Treat this book as a periodic, self-discovery diary in which you express
your innermost thoughts and feelings. Only then can you possibly reap its
full benefits. <br>
  <br>
• &nbsp; Dating each entry, enter your own unique questions and answers
(those which you see in the book) in the section provided at the end of each
chapter. <br>
  <br>
• &nbsp; To further embed your beliefs in your mind, review your answers at
the beginning of each month and, dating each new entry, make any necessary
revisions. By doing this, your&nbsp; answers will always remain current.
<br>
  <br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the book as an ongoing reference tool, referring to
itwhenever you wish to verify your beliefs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; The first page of each chapter doubles as a convenient check
list. Use it to check off those questions which you have already
answered.</strong></span></p>

  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever gone to a dull party which just
couldn't get off the ground because most of the people there didn't know
each other, or didn't know how to begin knowing each other because they
didn't know how to make conversation? By the time a little conversation
begins flowing, most of the guests have drunk so much that much of the
conversation has become silly, dull, or boring. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever been to a dull family gathering where no
one had anything to say to each other except the same old, boring, mundane,
repetitious things? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are distasteful experiences, but you need never be
victimized by them again. By using this book, you can turn any house party,
office party, Christmas or New Year's Eve party, family gathering, shower,
stag, buck and doe, husband and wife discussion, or one-on-one discussion
into an exciting, stimulating, and rewarding experience. To achieve this,
follow these steps: <br>
  <br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you next plan to be involved in any type of
gathering, take this book with you. <br>
  <br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; Act as moderator and play The Answer Game by asking the
questions from a chapter suitable for the occasion. <br>
  <br>
•&nbsp; If you wish, pass the book to someone else and have that person act
as moderator. Some of your self-discovery answers may already be filled in;
if you don't want the moderator to see those answers, have a second copy of
the book which remains blank. <br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By following the above steps, you will soon see
any occasion come to life and be transformed from something dull and boring
into a stimulating and rewarding experience. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To gain full advantage from this book's contents, carry it
with you regularly—the convenient size easily fits into pocket or purse. In
your spare moments , perhaps during lunch or a coffee break, or while you're
waiting in someone's office, browse through the book for questions you'd
like to answer, or, instead of discussing mundane topics like the weather or
the latest sports scores, use the book as a springboard to exciting and
meaningful conversation and discussion. <br>
