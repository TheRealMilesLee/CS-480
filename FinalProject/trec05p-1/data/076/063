Hey gang,

We are making solid progress on a number of fronts. From a 10,000 foot perspective, our main goal is to pull together all of the systems, curves, product descriptions/offerings, internal communications, and external communications of a fully functional business unit for presentation to Belden, Richter, Herndon and Presto by November 15. This morning, I spoke with Juli Salvagio who manages marketing for Enron Wholesale about getting the Renewable Power Desk space on the enron.com website. Take a look at the products and services offerings section of enron.com, and check out emissions trading or weather derivatives. The goal is to draft language (with photos -- ideas??) for an RPD site along those same lines. I will take an initial shot at the language (with a fundamental breakdown between wholesale and retail services) and then send around drafts for your comment the week of October 24.  I think we will be listed under the heading "Renewable Power Marketing" or "Green Power Marketing" (Which do you think is better?) 

On other fronts:

Team Fundies is cranking along well.
Richard and I are working to clean up all of our existing positions (scrubbing old EES contracts, managing inter-book issues so that any existing green tag positions fall out to the Green Desk).
Our Product Description has been professionalized by Enron Counsel (Richard Ring) and we are talking to wind, biomass, landfill and geothermal developers with good offers on tags.
We are working with EWS counsel and EES counsel to prepare a formal green tag contract that can be attached to either a standard EWC commodity contract or an EES commodity contract.
Stacey is roaming the country making the world safe for Green Tag trading -- she is preparing a regional summary of green tag/Green issues/protocols.
We continue to negotiate with LADWP for a services contract for their new renewable resources.
I haven't heard back from all of you on the proposed offsite location/dates.

EM
