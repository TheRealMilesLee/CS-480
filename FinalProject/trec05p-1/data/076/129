Sorry, I meant to set up the company as a Division not a trade name I am going to change the name.

Any questions pleas call me.

Tana,
I received a PA for Straightline (Division of U.S. Steel) and credit approved.  I ask Global to create an CP ID.  and the ID reads.  Straightline, a dba of US Steel Corporation.  Do I have to ask customer to re-fax PA with GCP name, CP ID # 142509?  or is okay to process like Straightline ( Division of U.S. Steel) ?

Let me know,
Thank you,
Claudia
