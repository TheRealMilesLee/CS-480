Starting Next Monday (Sep 17), we will be having a Northeast origination meeting for those wishing to attend.
Agenda will be:
- Deal update (and discription if new)
- Any brainstorm ideas to push deals forward
- Task required to move deals forward
- Assignment of tasks ( strongly suggested that associates and analysts attend)
- Issues and questions

Will will set up a consistant time and place for every monday morning, along with dial-in numbers for remote locations (Hi John!)
If there are any time preferences or additional agenda items you would like to include, please email them to me by tomorrow, so we can get the room and dial in organized.
This is meant to be very breif, and to ensure everyone cabapilities are effectively applied to all potential transactions.
Thanks,
Janelle
