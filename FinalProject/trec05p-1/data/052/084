From: Mrs. Esther Alan Buch, 

PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD. 
I am the above named person from Malaysia but now undergoing medical treatment
. I am married to Late Dr.Alan George Buch who worked  with  Malaysia embassy
in South Africa for nine years before  he died in the year 2003. We were
married for eleven years without a child. 
He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his
death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to
re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.
I got your contact from a christian journal. When my late husband was alive
he  deposited the sum of$8.6Million (eight Million six hundred thousand U.S.
Dollars) in my name with one finance/security company in Europe. Presently,
this money is still with the Financial Company in Europe. 
Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next four months
due to cancer problem Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known
my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a Christian
individual  that will utilize this money the way I am 
going to instruct here in. I want a church or individual that  will use this
to fund churches, orphanages  propagating the word of God and to ensure that
the house of God is maintained. The  Bible made us to understand that Blessed
is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child
 that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians
and I don't want my husband's hard  earned money to be misused by unbelievers.

I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner,
hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death
hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom
of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says, 'that the lord will fight my case and
I 
shall hold my peace'. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard
because of my health, and because of the  presence of my husband's relatives
around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With
God all things are possible. 
As  soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Finance/Security
Company in Europe. I will also issue you a letter of authority through my
attorney that will empower you as the original- beneficiary of this fund.
I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord  is my shepherd.
My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants
to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always  be prayerful
all through your life.Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing
for a church or Christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure
me that you will act accordingly as I stated  herein. Hoping to hear from
and  Remain blessed  in the name of the Lord. 
Yours in Christ, 
Mrs. Esther Alan buch.
