Halo!!
I am a 40 year old male. I have been married for over 16 years. I am physically fit. I have noticed I avoid sex because my wife likes to spend hours with me, and I have to maintain my erection or she will feel I'm not interested in her. I spend more time during sex wondering how long will I last. Now even though I get erections naturally, I take 50mg 15 minutes before love making, and now I can spend hours with foreplay and not worry if I'm gonna go soft or lose interest. I now look forward to romantic evenings and I initiate them.

After I started taking blood pressure medication, I noticed a distinct change in my ability to get an erection and keep it long enough to be of any use. It was impossible to have sex in any position except the missionary position and my ability to satisfy my wife vaginally went to zero. She is a wonderful person and never complained but recognizing that our lovemaking wasn't mutually satisfying made it even more difficult to achieve an adequate erection. When I told my doctor of the problem, he gave me a sample pack of Viagra Soft Tabs and I tried it without telling my wife what was going on. She noticed that I was longer and with more girth immediately. I satisfied her in the missionary position and then turned her over and finished "doggy style", which I haven't been able to do for years. We didn't try to make love again that night even though I could have done so within 20 minutes. I was shocked at how well it had worked. The following morning I was ready, willing and able to go for round 2. She climbed on top, again for the first time in years, and rode me until she had satisfied herself. I wanted another shot at doggy style and it worked great. Can't say enough about how well it worked. I'm a changed man and both of us are amazed at the difference. 

Excellent prices and service!
