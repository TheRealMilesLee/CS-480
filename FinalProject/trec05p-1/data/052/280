You beat me to the punch.  I spoke to Suresh Vasan who briefly worked Enrico and he suggested that I call Marcello.  

Thank you for the feedback.

So the scoop is He is Average.

He recently moved out of Bandwidth 6 weeks ago and back into Continental Power trading - why he is moving again after 6 weeks.  Is it a problem with the business or him?

He worked for Marcello Romano (Head of Bandwidth Trading in Europe) as John knows.  Marcello says he is a solid hard worker who has no edge.  If Marcello were to run UK Gas again he wouldn't take him - as he is not sharp.  So he wouldn't bother to move him across the Atlantic if it costs a lot.

Your call.  Ring Marcello for more information.  

Louise

Louise - Do you know this gentleman from your days in London?   His resume looks good and he is interested in moving to Houston and working in East Power.
 
John Suarez - You are going to need at least one and probably two solid cash/term traders for the SE region.   Talk to Seresh about this guy.
