politician in Cote d ivoire political arena. Because of my Father sincerity,
He was killed on the 19th of september 2002 by unknown soldiers in his

to me about the diplomatic box he deposited in a security company containing
us$30million ( thirty million)united states dollars) and my name was thenext

to as all arrangements for a hitch free transfer have been fully taken care
of. I want to assure you that this transactionnis 100 % risk free as no
other person knows this box apart from me and my Sister. Sir, as for your
reward and kind assistance I have resolve to give you 15% of the total amount
and 5% for any expenses that might be incured in the course of this
transaction.

I Planned to invest the rest of the money in your country under your
guidiance.
If you are willing to help me try as much as possible to reach me through
the email to enable us proceed in earnest towards concluding all transaction.
Sir, bear in mind that my life depend on this fund and I do hope that this
money will be safe when finally transfer into your new account. I do hope
of establishing a rewarding and good relationship with you and your family
after this transaction hoping to hear from you as soon as possible .
