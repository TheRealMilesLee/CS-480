Hi Jay:
I can only begin to imagine how stressed things must be for you right now. Jerril and I have our fingers crossed that things work out OK for you during the transition. Hopefully, the people at Dynegy will recognize what a smart, honest and harworking guy you are and reward you appropriately.

If you ever want to vent, let me know. Sometimes big sisters aren't always bossy and can even be helpful.
Love,
Meg
