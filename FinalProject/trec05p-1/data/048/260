First quote from Greg should read:  "We see no reason for gas and power markets to become unstable in the aftermath of yesterday's tragedies" . . .

Enron Appeals for Calm in US Natural Gas and Power Markets
 
      Enron appealed today for calm in US natural gas and power markets.  Enron will be available to buy and sell natural gas and power both over the phone and through its online platform Enrononline.
 
      "We see no reason for gas and power markets to panic in the aftermath of yesterday's tragedies," said Greg Whalley, President and Chief Operating Officer.  "These are domestic commodities and the physical infrastructure is secure and operating."
 
     Enrononline will be open for gas and power transactions from 7:00 am to 12:00 noon, CDT to enable market participants to make purchases and sales and adjust their positions as necessary.
