From:Mr.E.B Fasheyiky
London,U.K

Greetings to you.

I am Mr.E.B Fasheyiky and though I reside in the U.K,
I am actually a citizen of U.A.E. I am the heir
apparent to a family business with its "roots" in
Dubai, U.A.E. The importance of my position in my
family mandated that I be sent to study for a degree
in the U.K. At the conclusion of my degree programme,
my family decided to open the first European branch of
the company in the U.K and I was put in-charge to run
it. This was of course a good beginning for me.

At present, we are at the end of another trading year
and our auditors have once again brought it to our
attention, that the tax rates applicable to our
company due to the fact that we the owners are not
british is gradually "killing" our business. Unlike
the last time I was alerted, I have this time, taken a
critical overview of the records from "day one"
and the auditors seem very correct.

This situation when related to my father has really
been disturbing. After much "brain storming", my
father has decided to close the UK branch. He
has directed that we salvage what is left of our
investment and concentrate our efforts on Dubai in the
United Arab Emirates.

Now, you must wonder why I have contacted you! I am
contacting you now because there is an arrangement
that I have personally mapped out to ensure that what
ever cash remaining in the Company account be
transferred to who ever is willing to assist me in
this regards. All you will be required to do is to
draft an agreement from your end that you will be
supplying Medical and Agricultural Equipment to the
tune of $18,500,000 (Eighteen Million,Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars) in my Company's
favour.Once this agreement is set up,I will need to
see the contents and have a copy submitted to my
bankers here so they can immediately begin the
transfer processes of the stipulated amount in
favour of goods to be supplied(Supposedly) by you.

After the agreement between you and I has been
submitted to my bankers, I will file for bankruptcy
while the agreement still stands with my bankers.This
way,I will be able to leave the U.K back to my Country
without having to pay so much taxes on the funds
remaining and I will not be loosing much money at the
same time.You must understand that I personally have
something in it for myself because what I declare to
the company in Dubai,is what will be stated and
accepted.

If you are willing to assist,please respond to this
message and bear in mind that your confidentiality is
required because if this arrangement fails,I will
probably loose everything I own in the U.K

For your assistance,there is a reward.This will be
discussed as soon as I get a response from you.

Feel free to reach me by email at
fasheyiky@excite.com. I will be awaiting your response
anxiously.

Thank you in view of your anticipated urgent
cooperation.

Yours Faithfully,

Mr.E.B Fasheyiky
