     Attached is the tpa file , apparently the Standard GISB tpa was "modified' by our legal department and this is what my group has been using ever since.
     I  was given this file when I started here in January of this year.  Please verify that the information is accurate since the original template must have  generated from
     legal and passed on to Gary Payne.  
    I am assuming that Kim Bennick had a template somewhere.



      


     Thanks
