Nomination Update - As of this afternoon most desks are in the same position. We didn't have a complete trading session and therefore we were not able to balance our positions completely. All pipelines and LDC's were contacted and will allow us to roll current day noms forward and then take another look at it in the AM to make the necessary adjustments. Some (the minority) of the smaller pipes were able to balance their pipes and submit a complete set of nominations. Overall, intraday noms will be used on Wednesday to clean-up/balance Wednesday's gas day. 
 
Please call if you need any additional information.......Bob Superty
