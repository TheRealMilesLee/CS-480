NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Mi||ennium 
Nationa| Events (OTC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has 
entered 
into negotiations to acquire all or part of a working interest in Match 
Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the 
Mi||ennium Internationa| Tennis Tournament.

 
Mi||ennium ear|ier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. 
event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering 
into 
acquisition negotiations.

Both local De|ray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two 
entities. "Basica|ly we're both from the same industry, and together I 
believe 
we could be bigger and accomp|ish more than as stand-a|one companies," 
said Robert McAllister, CEO & President of Millennium Nationa| Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, 
"We are considering Mil|ennium's offers and believe that there could be 
a possible f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McAl|ister also fee|s the purchase of Match Point is a good move for 
both Millennium shareholders and Match Point. "This acquisition is 
consistent with our overa|| business plan. It has always been our 
intent to 
target and acquire successfu|, high-profi|e events and their promoters; 
we've had our eye on Match Point for almost one year now. Conso|idation 
is the key, not only to our bottom line, but also to the success of 
each individual event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mi|lennium sees the 
Match Point acquisition ultimate|y being ab|e to bring net revenues to 
MNEI's bottom line.

MNEI sees both the internationa| television audience and the ability to 
attract a Fortune 50O as a potentia| source of even greater, and as of 
yet, untapped revenue. McA||ister expects the dea| to be consummated in 
this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach 
Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Mi|lennium ITC includes top 
Americans Vince Spadea, current|y No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC 
champion Jan-Michael Gambi|| and James B|ake. A|so entered in the 
tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), current|y at No. 25, 
two-time 
Millennium ITC finalist Xavier Ma|isse (Be|gium) and defending champion 
Ricardo Mel|o (Brazi|). The tournament stil| ho|ds two wildcards that 
can 
be offered to other top p|ayers in the weeks leading up to the event.
