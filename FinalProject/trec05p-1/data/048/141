DEAR FRIEND,

Compliment of the season to you.

It is my humble pleasure to write you this letter in respect of the fact
that we have not met in person. First, let me start by introducing myself=

properly to you. I am Barrister COLIN CROSSMAN, a legal practitioner and
personal attorney to a deceased client of mine (names withheld fornow,for=

security reasons),who was national of your country and has the same surna=
me
with you. I consider you fit for this claim, since both of you are of the=

same nationality, he was a foreign staff of Inter-Bau Oil and consulting
services and her he died along with his wife and only son in an auto cras=
h
on the 16th.Februrary, 2002. Since his tragic death, I have made frantic
efforts to contact any other member of his family but to no avail. The ma=
nagement
of his bank here has sent severalwarnings to my chambers, asking me to co=
ntact
and send to them immediately, any of the relative of my late client, as
they will soon declare his funds deposited with them as ?UNCLAIMED? (if
they remain untouched after five years) subsequently,they will be transfe=
rred
to the Government reserves.

MY PROPOSAL
I am seeking your permission to present you as the next-of-kin to my late=

client, so that the funds totaling Nineteen million, four hundred thousan=
d
United States dollars (USD$19.4M) would be subsequently transfered and pa=
id
into your bank account as the  beneficiary/next-of-kin. All documents and=

proofs to enable you get this fund have carefully worked out from my tabl=
e
and I will perfect every document to be in accordance to the banking and
inheritance laws and guidelines,hence you have nothing to worry about
as you bear no risk at all. All I require from you is your permission,tru=
st
and sincerity to present your details to the bank. For your assistance,
25% of the money will be for you, 20% for charity, 5% for any expenses in=
curred,while
50% will be for me. After you receive the funds in your bank account,I sh=
all
travel to meet you and we shall share accordingly.

I will also be interested in any lucrative business venture you advise.
If you are go ing to help me,please inform me immediately by replying thi=
s
letter, putting in your direct telephone and fax numbers, so I can contac=
t
you to explain further I await your immediate reply to enable us start th=
is
transaction in earliest as time is fast running out. Once I receive your
reply, I will
send you the text of application for immediate for immediate application
of claim.If this proposal is fine by you, then kindly get to me furnishin=
g
me with your most confidential telephone, fax and email address, so I can=

 forward to you the relevant details of this transaction. Lastly, I will
plead with you to keep this deal very confidential.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation.

Best Regards,

COLLINS CROSSMAN
