ATTENTION:
Haas Computing Services has been made aware of a software problem that has 
occurred with the IZIO system.   The problem has caused  some of, and in 
some cases, all of the course information that had been previously 
populated, to be deleted.  We are aware of this problem and are attempting 
to resolve is ASAP.  We ask that, if you are affected, that you send an 
email message to the helpdesk with your course information that is 
missing.   Also, we ask that you give us the opportunity to resolve this 
problem, and NOT come to the Computing Services Front Desk, with a deluge 
of complaints.

We understand your frustration, and are working quickly to resolve this 
matter.  Once resolved, you will receive another memo indicating 
such.  Again, thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
