ATTENTION ALL PLANT OPERATORS , SHIPPERS AND NOMINATING AGENTS: 

IMBALANCE PAYBACK GAS AND/OR OVER-DELIVERY RESTRICTION UPDATE 


Due to continuing warm weather and operational issues, PSCo's restriction on imbalance payback gas and/or over-deliveries into the system will remain in affect until further notice.  In order to avoid the need for upcoming weekday and/or weekend OBP's, it is critical that Shippers, Nominating Agents and Plant Operators do not schedule imbalance payback gas or deliver more than confirmed nominations during this period.

Plant Operators should restrict deliveries to confirmed nominations ONLY during this restricted period.  If over-deliveries become a problem, PSCo will activate flow control valves on any plants involved.

Shippers/Nominating Agents should not nominate any imbalance payback gas to PSCo for the duration of the restriction.  Any imbalance gas remaining on the system for this period will be cut to -0- by PSCo.  Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
