Kay,
We are generally around.  I spoke with Kerri last night and she suggested
there might be a call around 12:30 CST, 1:30 EST today.  I am available for
an hour beginning at that time and then again after the conclusion of my
2:30 EST meeting.  The problem is that I don't know how long the latter
meeting is going to take.  I know Kerri had planned to be generally
available beginning at 1:30 EST, as well, but I am not sure exactly how her
schedule looks.  I am sure we can put something together, though.
Ryan
