I see from the attached outage report that the overhauls on the existing units at Station 4 are scheduled to begin April 1, 2002 (instead of March 1, 2002 as previously noted) and run through June 4, 2002.   Please keep in mind that July and August are the "tariff months" and the units need to be operational  effective July 1.   Questions, let me know.  Thanks for your help.  Donna
