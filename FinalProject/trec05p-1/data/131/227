Dear all,
 
Please note that effective tomorrow, the area codes to dial into Mexico have changed.  To dial into Mexico City, the area code (55) will follow the country code (52). The eight-digit number will follow. 
 
Our main telephone number will be as follows: (52-55) 5081-1424.
My direct line will be as follows (52-55) 5081-1423.
Our fax number: (52-55) 5081-1425.
 
New area codes will become effective for other cities.
 
If you need additional information on city codes, or dialing instructions, you may visit www.cofetel.gob.mx <http://www.cofetel.gob.mx/>". 

Very truly yours,
