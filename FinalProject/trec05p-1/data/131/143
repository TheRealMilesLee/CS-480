This works.  I think it is what Dynegy is looking for.  It allows set off of swaps OTM to Dynegy against the Sithe cash flows Enron owes Dynegy.  

We need to make sure we don't default on trading agreements otherwise it brings down the Sithe payments owed.

If they agree to discounting at Prime + 2% it reduces our liability in the books.

harlan: for forwarding to dynegy

the framework re the sithe letter:
1.added cross default to master netting agreement.
2.added acceleration of ena's payment obligations in the event of default by enron parties under the master and close-out by the dynegy parties.
3.added set off right to dynegy parties if they end up owing under the master to the remaining payment obligations of ena.

re the master netting agreement which you will send:
1. added cross default to ena's payment obligations under the sithe letter.
2. added set off right to dynegy parties like in 3. above.
