	Thank you for your understanding with me being out yesterday.  I asked Ginger to pass on message to you since I knew you were in that meeting.   In addition to my checkup, my doctor ordered tests that he wanted done the same day (totally unexpected).  I have one other test but I'm trying to schedule the week I'm on vacation.

	I hope it didn't cause any problems.

	Just found out yesterday as well, my son's friend has come down with measles (not sure what kind).  He rides with my son to school.  Neither of my kids have had this so I'm concerned (I've had German measles) - I should find out for sure today.

	When it rains, it pours, right?

	Linda
