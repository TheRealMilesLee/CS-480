Mike Falarski,PSVC and Carl Guardino,SVMG would like to invite you to
"Philips Electronics & Silicon Valley Mfg. Group - 2002 Good Government
Luncheon Series".


Note from Mike Falarski,PSVC and Carl Guardino,SVMG:
CARL GUARDINO, President & CEO, Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group and MIKE
FALARSKI, Director, Philips Electronics will be hosting the next Good
Government Luncheon Series (GGLS). The 10 year series was previously hosted
by Amdahl Corporation and is being re-launched in 2002. The first luncheon
will be held at the Philips Silicon Valley Center in Sunnyvale at noon,
Monday, January 14, 2002.  The speaker will be Philip Angelides, Treasurer,
State of California.

We are deeply indebted to Carl Guardino for arranging for Mr. Angelides to
speak. As the State of California faces serious budget problems in the New
Year,  Mr. Angelides is California's constitutional chief financial officer.
Hence, his comments on how our elected officials can work together to solve
the State's pressing problems will be very informative and of interest.

Since seating is limited, we strongly recommend you visit Evite website to
