Cathy,
Please have someone in your group email myself and Mike Carson with the Fed Reference Number for each wire we send for delivery by 11 am CST.  We need the reference number by 10:30 am so we can call the counterpart and sooth their nerves.  It will tenuous for a little while until we build their confidence that we will consistently pay.  Thanks for your help.
Doug
