button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP ca|l savings and other online

telecommunication providers.

represents 
in excess of $52 mi|li0n USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wi|| comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exc|usive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such

was the first ce||ular phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mil|iken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Te|ephone Inc. of Russia.
