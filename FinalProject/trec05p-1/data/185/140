The information I provided to all of you is NOT exaggerated, thank you very much.  You obviously don't have a clue as to what is happening with these employees, how far would $4,500 go for you if you lost your job today and all of your retirement and were a single mother?  That response to Louise just shows your obvious lack of compassion and to think you are the head of HR disturbs me.

David,

Marla is going to track down the issues below.  As you know, we are trying our best to address issues like these once we are aware of them.  

Thanks,

Robert

Louise,

I think the information below is a little exaggerated, but there is truth in our suppliers having difficulty dealing with all the requests they have been inundated with. I will ask Robert and Cynthia to take a look and perhaps they can give summarise better than I what the actual position is.

Happy New Year all,

I have been with Enron for over 16 years and I have made some very good friends during my time here and right now I am feeling their pain and panic.  I talk to several of my terminated friends (and sister) each week and get updates from them on what is going on outside of Enron.  I just want to do whatever I can to help them get through these hard times, this is the reason for my weekly reminders to you all who have the power to do something for them.

I passed on the phone numbers for Towers Perrin and other numbers that they need to get their money from the Cash Balance Plan or to find out more about the COBRA benefits, etc. but there is a major stumbling block in their way right now.  They keep being told that no one can do anything for them, not even send them the necessary forms to get the ball rolling on these benefits, because Enron has not changed their status from active to terminated (or inactive).  How can it possibly take a month to get this status changed?  Please realize that a lot of these people have nothing:  no paycheck coming in, no unemployment checks YET, no retirement, no cash balance money, no medical benefits....they are feeling scared and panicked....PLEASE lets do something to help them.  I have no clue what all it takes to get 4,500+ employees status changed but surely it cannot take a month to accomplish this.  Whomever is in charge of getting this done, are we sure they have a sense of urgency about the situation?  People could lose their homes, cars, etc. while they are waiting on all this red tape....this is very important.

Please advise.

Sabra Dinari
