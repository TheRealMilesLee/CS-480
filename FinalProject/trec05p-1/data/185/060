On November 17, 2OO4, Yap Internationa| revea|ed a unique and patent 
pending technology marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap Internationa| 
Personal Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Persona| Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending solution to a rea| problem that is inherent in 
all current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is limited to the physical |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP call. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy a||ows 
the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed ca|ls from any telephone, not just 
one physica||y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|l their Personal Gateway from any ce||ular or landline push 
button phone in the world, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP ca|l savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partia||y or entirely the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2OO4, Yap International announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
Internationa| 
announced the signing of an exclusive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Central and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exc|usive 
contractua| 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 2O0,00O 
VoIP 
units to be deployed throughout Guatemala in 2O05. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi||i0n USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products will comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exc|usive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 2O05, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. V|adimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ura| State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in genera| programming /data base management and the 
physics of electro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background a|so inc|udes direct 
invo|vement in the development of proprietary technologies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cellular phone network for the city of Che|yabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi||iken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
deve|opments 
of the past months leaves us with too|s necessary to commercialize and 
market our products on a g|obal scale. We expect our mi|estones to be 
met 
and thus executing our business p|an as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan
