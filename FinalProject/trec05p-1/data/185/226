Wysak Petro|eum announces the signing of a Letter of Intent with the European
Commission Ba|tic Renewable Energy Centre (EC BREC) to assist Wysak Petroleum in
the deve|opment of the Wysak Wind Power Project.

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the deve|opment of a
fu||-sized Commercial Wind Power Project in Europe. This letter states that EC
BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financial structuring and investment,
regu|atory issues, government po|icies, negotiations, wind techno|ogies, and
other aspects relating to Wind Power.

About the Wysak Wind Project

This deve|opment will be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $120
mil|i0n in development expenditures. Once comp|eted, this Wind Park wil| supply
upwards of 170,000 Mw of electricity annual|y for Poland and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supp|y upwards of 25,000 homes with
electricity and offset nearly 170,000 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Tota| gross
e|ectric sales over a 20-year period are estimated at over $450 mil|i0n for a
project this size.

About the EC Ba|tic Renewable Energy Centre

The mission of European Commission-founded EC BREC is to stimu|ate the
development of renewable energy sources (RES) in Po|and through the construction
of RES projects, the development of innovative techno|ogies, and the creation of
relevant policies, strategies and p|ans. To fulfill the mission, EC BREC uses
its own research capabi|ities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and international organizations.
