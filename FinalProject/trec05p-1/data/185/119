You are invited to participate in ERCOT's Mock TCR Auction scheduled for
January 2002.  The purpose of the mock auction is to give stakeholders
an opportunity to become familiar with the TCR software before the first
"live" auction takes place.

Bidding will begin at 10 a.m. January 9, 2002 and bidding will stop at
10 a.m. on January 14, 15, and 16 for each of the corresponding CSCs.
Results of the mock auction will be posted on the TCR website shortly
after each CSC auction ends.

Anyone interested in participating in the Mock TCR Auction should email
either Pamela Dautel at pdautel@ercot.com or Julie Ringling at
jringling@ercot.com and request a logon id and password.  Please submit
your request to participate by January 8, 2002.  After you receive a
logon id and password, please go to http://stage.ercot.com/tcr to
participate in the mock auction.   

We look forward to your participation in the TCR Mock Auction.
