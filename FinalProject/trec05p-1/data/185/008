Entergy-Koch has put a requirement on doing transactions with us, which requires that wires from EPMI must be received by 11 am CST on the day of purchase.  In order to facilitate the 11 am deadline, Treasury needs the full approval packet by no later than 9 am.  The physical packet paperwork will need to be to Don Miller (give to me ECS 05579 and I'll run it through) by 8 am.  We will need the wire request and Cash Use Approval Request form from Evelyn Aucoin's group and the price justification spreadsheet from Corry Bentley.  I'm working with Treasury to get notification of the Fed Reference number by 10:30.  Thanks for your help.
 
Doug
