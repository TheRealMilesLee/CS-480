Not too worried about oven bugs--hospitals sterilize at about 270 deg.--if I remember the thermostat doesnt work and that oven runs at about 800 deg.

Departure: E says he is better off leaving Fri a.m.(4 hunts) w/ Sun return.  I was thinking Fri p.m. for more relaxed Monday return(4 hunts)--I'm OK either way, but I need to let John know if I'm out Fri or Mon.

I think I remember promising to eat dead, raw heart meat...........a..an..and ..I'll  
do it man !!!

Most importantly, how did ya'll leave the keg last time--I damn sure don't want to show up Fri. p.m. after being "IN" for four hours and have nuthin' but a cup of dust waiting!!
Lets plan ahead on the Al K. Hall issue, remember I'm drinking for two now..(Pig and I).

Food Issue:  Just because Piggy ain't cookin' doesn't mean we have to eat like alternate/persons.  I say we do it right at least on Sat night.(i.e.ribeyes.......)
Sat. a.m.: I made a Mex. egg/cheese/& stuff casserole for x-mas morning that was pretty damn good---I can pre-make it and all we have to do is heat & eat.

...other than that: Scotch, coffee, and firearms.

My $.02

Can't "pull-off" this weekend.  Libby, Libby, Libby on the label, label,
label is coming in this weekend w/ the boys for a belated xmas gathering and
have a party planned.  Or, maybe it's just that I don't want to be forced to
eat more heart-meat.

planning on going the last two weekends. He intends to go during the

No other guests invited.
