Going forward, as a precautionary measure, we will begin locking users out of the system if the need arises.  We will use our Watchdog application in order to initiate this process.  We will do so only as a last resort and will notify you that we will be doing this.  Our reasons for doing this are mainly to ensure the critical system resources are provided to the users that need them the most.

The old list we had from Sybase no longer exists.  I need your help in putting together a new list.  Please provide the list of people who ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL users that have to be on the system.  Obviously, the situation isn't remedied if everyone is an exception user :)

Please provide User Name and Application they need (i.e. Volume Management, Settlements, Path Manager).

The sooner I get this, the sooner we can get this implemented.

Thanks!
