Michelle, 

I have an employee that wants out of his employment agreement.    He feels it was a mistake to sign it.  He is starting into his second year of the contract.   What are our options in this case?   He's willing to give up all the options given him and any future payments.   I promised him I wouldn't share his name with anyone.

Gary
