Okay, we'll try for 3:30 today.  It might be better to use Drew's conference call in number to save time.

The number is: 1-800-711-8000

Please get a time set when the above folks can get together for an hour.  We had tentatively set it for 1:30, but Mary Kay can't join and I'd like her to be there also.  I'm clear after 3:30.  Thanks.
