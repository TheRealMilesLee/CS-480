Tana -

Please let me know who may be handling the ISDA for TEA.  This would be information that needs to go to them so that the ISDA can be completed.  

Thanks.

Mark

Leslie,

I just spoke with the gas futures trader at TEA and he would like to trade on EnronOnline, but can't due to ISDA not being in place.  
I know  they trade on behalf of others, but is there anything we can to do accommodate them, in order to migrate their gas business to EOL ?

Thanks for you assistance.

T.
