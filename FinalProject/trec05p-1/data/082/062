Folks,

Although standard scheduling in Mountain Prevailing Time makes the most
sense for Montana Power Company, majority will prevail.  Therefore, since
MPC has the ability to convert our schedules to alternate time zones for
check out (pre schedule and real time), we will attempt to accommodate the
will of the masses. I guess I'm not real clear on the desired result here.
If we are only talking about the need to check day ahead and hour ahead
schedules with adjacent CA's in a time zone other than Mountain, we do that
already.  If I'm missing the bigger picture, what's new.

	It's been brought to my attention that we never resolved the issue
of the
	common scheduling time (no Freudian slip on the acronym).  The group
agreed
	to a PST value in July, but we wanted to survey the OC and WMIC
first before
	going further.  That was to be one of our topic in Vancouver.
Well....

	So, I'd like to get a feel from the group: the survey leaned toward
Pacific
	Prevailing Time as that match up with energy products, so.. continue
to go
	forward with PST as in July, modify our suggestion to PPT or drop
all
	together and wait to see if NERC is going to come up with something.
If we
	decide to go with either PST or PPT, I will get the OC Steering to
help with
	clarification on this as a due process item or an item that can be
brought
	to the OC for vote in 2002.  In addition, I would think that most
would
	agree that implementation if it takes affect would be favorable at
the April
	2002 time change, so that is my suggestion that we use, if ISAS goes
forward
	with the request to the OC.

	Please get back with your thought by next Wednesday so I can put
together
	something for the upcoming OC meetings.
