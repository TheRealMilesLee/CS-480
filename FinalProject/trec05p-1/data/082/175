You and your gang played a huge role in Joe's selection.  Do all the right folks know that?  We in fact arranged for Frevert and Kean to lunch with Joe about three weeks ago in anticipation of this event.

Our sources in Washington have reported to us that the White House has been calling Senate offices this morning to announce that Joe Kelliher will be nominated to the open FERC seat.  As you may be aware, Kelliher is currently an energy policy advisor to the Bush Administration.
