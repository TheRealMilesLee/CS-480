I'm putting the finishing touches on the agenda for the Management Conference.  With General Norman Schwarzkopf and Gary Hamel scheduled to speak, this year's program is superb.  

Currently, there is time on the agenda to include two 30 minute business unit presentations or another outside speaker.  Since we already have four external speakers and last year's feedback indicated an interest in hearing from internal leadership, I am proposing the business unit presentations -- specifically, Global Markets and Industrial Markets.  Please give me your feedback.  I will need to notify Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman, as well as Ray Bowen and Jeff McMahon very soon.
