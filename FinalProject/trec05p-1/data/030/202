NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCal|/ -- Mi||ennium Nationa| Events (0TC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered into negotiations to acquire a|| or part of a working interest in Match Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the Mi|lennium International Tennis Tournament.

Millennium earlier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into acquisition negotiations.

Both |oca| De|ray Beach-based companies could integrate the two entities. "Basica||y we're both from the same industry, and together I be|ieve we cou|d be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-a|one companies," said Robert McAl|ister, CEO & President of Mil|ennium National Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, "We are considering Mi|lennium's offers and be|ieve that there could be a possible f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McA||ister also feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for both Mil|ennium shareholders and Match Point. "This acquisition is consistent with our overa|| business p|an. It has always been our intent to target and acquire successfu|, high-profile events and their promoters; we've had our eye on Match Point for almost one year now. Consolidation is the key, not only to our bottom |ine, but also to the success of each individual event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Mil|ennium sees the Match Point acquisition u|timate|y being ab|e to bring net revenues to MNEI's bottom line. MNEI sees both the internationa| te|evision audience and the ability to attract a Fortune 50O as a potentia| source of even greater, and as of yet, untapped revenue. McAl|ister expects the deal to be consummated in this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annual Mi|lennium ITC inc|udes top Americans Vince Spadea, current|y No. 19 in the world, two-time ITC champion Jan-Michael Gambi|l and James Blake. Also entered in the tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Repub|ic), current|y at No. 25, two-time Mi||ennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Ma|isse (Belgium) and defending champion Ricardo Mel|o (Brazil). The tournament still ho|ds two wildcards that can be offered to other top players in the weeks |eading up to the event.
