Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Mrs Victoria Ubam; I am the regional manager of Magnum trust Trust 
Bank Plc

Internet. I am 44years of age and married with 3 lovely kids. It may interest 
you to hear that I am a Woman of PEACE and don't want problem, I only
hope we can assist each other. If you don't want this business offer kindly 
forget it, as I will not contact you again.

I have packaged a financial transaction that will benefit both of us, as the 
regional manager of the Bank; it is my duty to send in a financial report to 
my head office in the
capital city Abuja at the end of each year. On the course of the last year 
2003 end of year report, I discovered that my branch in which I am the manager 
made Two million five hundred fifty thousand dollars [US$2,550.000.00] which 
my
head office are not aware of and will never be aware of. I have since place 
this fund on what we call SUSPENSE ACCOUNT without any beneficiary.

As an officer of the bank I can not be directly connected to this money, so 
this informed my contacting you for us to work so that you can assist receive 
this money into your
bank account for us to share. While you will have 30% of the total fund. Note

f you accept this offer to work with me, I will
appreciate it very much. As soon as I receive your response I will details you 
on how we can achieve it successfully.
