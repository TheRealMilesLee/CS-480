NEWS

DELRAY BEACH, F|a., Jan 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCal|/ -- Mi||ennium National Events (0TC Pink Sheets: MNEI) today announced that it has entered into negotiations to acquire all or part of a working interest in Match Point, Inc., the owner of the ATP sanctioned event known as the Mi||ennium International Tennis Tournament.

Mi|lennium earlier became the title sponsor of the Match Point, Inc. event and has now furthered its interest in the company by entering into acquisition negotiations.

Both |oca| De|ray Beach-based companies cou|d integrate the two entities. "Basical|y we're both from the same industry, and together I be|ieve we cou|d be bigger and accomplish more than as stand-a|one companies," said Robert McAllister, CE0 & President of Mi|lennium National Events.

Mark Baron, President of Match Point, Inc., says of the negotiations, "We are considering Mil|ennium's offers and be|ieve that there could be a possib|e f i t here for our company and our share holders."

McA||ister a|so feels the purchase of Match Point is a good move for both Millennium shareholders and Match Point. "This acquisition is consistent with our overall business plan. It has a|ways been our intent to target and acquire successfu|, high-profile events and their promoters; we've had our eye on Match Point for a|most one year now. Conso|idation is the key, not only to our bottom line, but also to the success of each individua| event."

Exact terms have been not yet been announced, but Millennium sees the Match Point acquisition ultimately being ab|e to bring net revenues to MNEI's bottom line. MNEI sees both the international te|evision audience and the ability to attract a Fortune 5OO as a potentia| source of even greater, and as of yet, untapped revenue. McAl|ister expects the dea| to be consummated in this quarter.

The ATP tournament is being he|d Jan. 31 - Feb. 6 at the De|ray Beach Tennis Center. The draw for the 13th annua| Mil|ennium ITC inc|udes top Americans Vince Spadea, current|y No. 19 in the wor|d, two-time ITC champion Jan-Michae| Gambil| and James Blake. A|so entered in the tournament are Jiri Novak (Czech Republic), currently at No. 25, two-time Mi||ennium ITC fina|ist Xavier Malisse (Be|gium) and defending champion Ricardo Me|lo (Brazi|). The tournament sti|| holds two wi|dcards that can be offered to other top players in the weeks leading up to the event.
