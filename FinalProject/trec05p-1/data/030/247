way of gratification from a contract awarded by us under
the budget allocation to my Ministry and this bill has been
approved for payment by the concerned Ministries.The
contract has since been executed,commissioned and the
contractor company, paid off. We are left with the balance
of US$20.5M which was given to us by the company for
influencing the contract in their favour amidst heavy
competition from rival companies. But under our protocol
ivision,civil servants are forbidden to operate or own
