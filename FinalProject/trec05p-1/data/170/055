Thought you might be interested in these.

My instructions to the team have been: "Same, but different", i.e. a freshening, without any real functional changes, so as to both (a) Reinforce that it is a new entity behind NETCo Online and (b) ensure an easy transition for customers who are used to how EnronOnline works.

Hi Dave, 
    We are putting together a new look and feel for the re-launch of the website pending a deal.  We have a designer on Teresa Smith's team who developed these concepts.  There is a lot of preliminary work we can do in preparation, once we've chosen a design. Kal and I both liked the first one.  Please let me know what you think.
