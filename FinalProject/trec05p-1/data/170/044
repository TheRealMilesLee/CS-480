A very dedicated Teamsters Union worker was attending a convention in Las 
Vegas and, as you would expect, decided to check out the local brothels 
nearby.  
When he got to the first one, he asked the Madam, 
"Is this a union house?" 
"No," she replied, "I'm sorry, it isn't." 
"Well, if I pay you $100.00, what cut do the girls get?" 
"The house gets $80.00 and the girls get $20.00."  
Mightily offended at such unfair dealings, the man stomped off down the 
street in search of a more equitable, hopefully unionized shop. His search 
continued until finally he reached a brothel where the Madam responded, "Why  
yes sir, this IS a Union House."  
The man asked, "And if I pay you $100.00, what cut do the girls get?" "The 
girls get $80.00 and the house gets $20.00."  
"That's more like it!" the Teamster said. He handed the Madam $100.00, 
looked around the room and pointed to a stunningly attractive blonde. "I'd 
like her for the night."  
"I'm sure you would, sir," said the Madam, then gesturing to an 85 year old 
woman in the corner, "but Ethel here has seniority....."
