Lincoln Electric System (LES) would like us to set out in writing what a delivery point operator is.  LES is constructing and owning a new TBS (LES TBS #1) to their new power plant near Lincoln.  Apparently, having a letter setting this out is very important to them.  Dari has developed the attached letter and wanted to run it by you all for your approval.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you have any issues with the letter.  Thanks!
