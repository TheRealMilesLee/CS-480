Attached are the preliminary reports ready for your review.

Jan - Since, TK is out of the office, could you please let me know what the daily rates [associated with deliveries to California only] are for contract 27161 (USGT) and 27495 (Astra).  

All - Please review the footnotes under Item 3 to make sure the descriptions related to changes in operational capacity are accurately stated.


Due to people being out of the office for the upcoming holidays and vacation, please provide updates/comments by COB on Friday, 12/21/01, so I can incorporate and forward to Omaha for filing with the FERC. 

 

Thanks,
Elizabeth
