Subject:	Information On Less than 20 KW Customers for Submission to PUC Tomorrow and to Maintain ESP Registration In California

Greetings:

As part of the PUC's inquiry into EES/EEMC, the PUC wants to know how many accounts we have that are less than 20 KW, including all residential and commercial customers.  That information is due tomorrow at the Commission.
To keep our ESP registration current in California, we must give the PUC a security deposit (surety bond, or like instrument) by the end of this week.  The size of the deposit is determined by the number of customers we have that are less than 20KW (both residential and commercial).

So we need the information to submit to the PUC by 10 AM (PST) tomorrow, and we need it ASAP to get our security desposit to the PUC by the end of the week to keep our registration current.

We need to identify the person that can gather this information quickly.  Any thoughts on who that person might be?	  Appreciate the help.

Best,
Jeff
