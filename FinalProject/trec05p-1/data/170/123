Montana Oil and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Explore further opportunities in
Alberta Canada, is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most high|y coveted
reservoirs.

Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oi| and Gas
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oil and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News)
announces that the Sy|van Lake oil and gas project is sti|| awaiting a
rig at this time. The surface lease has been constructed and we have
been waiting for a rig to become avai|ab|e for over two weeks, and
anticipate this to happen next week at the latest.

The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sy|van Lake project.

Symbo| - MOGI
Price - .41

Reasons to conside MOGI:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bul|
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves potential|y worth mu|ti-millions, MOGI is sel|ing for less
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.

4. Montana Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. A|ready
shares in the oi| and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa||
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors
for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers like Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest gains
are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e
and even quadruple returns.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 30, 2005 (PRIMEZONE) -- Montana Oil
and Gas, Inc., (Pink Sheets: MOGI) President Peter Sanders is please to
announce the following update on its Sylvan Lake project.

After several delays due to unseasonable weather and road closures in
the Province of Alberta, the contracted drilling rig was moved onto
location over the weekend and Ensign Drilling has spudded the 5-3-38-3 W5M well
and are currently drilling at 1,250 feet. Surface casing will be run to
930 feet. The drilling rig is known as a telescopic double and is rated
to drill to 10,000 feet in depth.  Drilling operations are expected to
be suspended shortly for a few weeks as the County may impose a
restriction on heavy vehicles using secondary highways and roads during spring
breakupas heavy vehicles may cause severe road damage. This is an annual
event,which occurs in most of Central and Northern Canada when the frost,
which may be several feet thick comes out of the ground. Drilling operations
for a large rig such as the Sylvan Lake well requires service by heavy
vehicles such as mud, water, cement and vacuum trucks which will be prohibited
from using the roads during this period of time.  Peter Sanders notes,
¡§The road bans that have been taking place all over Alberta happen
every year and in the spring is no surprise, all oil and gas companies are
effected by breakup, the good thing is, is that we have the rig on site, which will
remain there until we are finished drilling, surface casing has been
completed and we will be ready to finish drilling the minute the road
bans are lifted".

The Sylvan Lake Prospect is a well defined 3-D seismic structural high
within a preserved Pekisko remnant ¡§island¡¨ that may have virgin
reservoirs with similar production potential as the adjacent N Pool where 6 wells
have produced 680,000 barrels oil since 1997. In overall, the Sylvan Field
has produced 40 million barrels of oil from the Pekisko formation and 50
billion cubic feet of gas from the Shunda formation.

Ensign Drilling will test a total of 30 feet from several zones in the
Shunda formation at 7,155 feet and a 30-foot Pekisko oil formation at 7,320
feet. When drilling resumes, the hole is planned to reach a total depth of
7,570 feet, which may take some 10 days to then complete drilling and testing.

Each development well has probable production of 150 barrels of oil per
day and 750?thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1
billion cubic feet gas and 300,000 barrels of oil. There are four other pay
zones that are prospective for gas. The average well in the Sylvan Lake Field has
produced 500 barrels of oil per day and/or over one million cubic feet of gas
per day. If successful, the company intends to drill up to 4 more wells on these
land sections.  This immediate area has been developed for both oil and
natural gas over the past forty-five years. Accordingly a multitude of gas
gathering and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been
constructed. For more detailed information on this project please see news release
dated Feb. 7th, 2005.

Good Luck and Successfu| Trading.
