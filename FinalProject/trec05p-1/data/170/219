Dear Paul:

Thank you for making Orbitz your travel partner. Superior customer
care is our highest priority - and we'd like you to experience
it firsthand. On your next trip, you'll receive our exclusive
"Traveler Care Alerts".

With this feature, messages containing important information
about an upcoming flight are relayed to your phone, pager, PDA
or e-mail for free. They include news about potential delays
and cancellations from our very own air-traffic management specialist,
travel agents and journalists working around the clock.

For your next trip you will receive these alerts by e-mail at
plucci@enron.com, which is the address you included in your profile.
If you prefer, you can receive these messages by phone, pager
or other device, as well.  You can also arrange for family members,
friends or co-workers to receive alerts about your trip.  To
edit your profile, follow these steps:

1. Go to http://www.orbitz.com
2. Click "My Stuff"
3. If you are asked to log in, enter your Orbitz member ID and
password
4. Locate your next trip under Current Reservations in "My Stuff"
5. Click "Edit Care Alerts" for that trip
6. To choose not to receive these alerts, click "Cancel Care
Alerts."

Check out the Orbitz Web site to "Learn more about Travel Alerts"
(http://www.orbitz.com/App/traveler_care/care_alerts.jsp)

Don't get caught unaware by travel delays again. We look forward
to your comments.

Thank you for your business.
Orbitz Cares
