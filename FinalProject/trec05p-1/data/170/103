Hello All,

If you're like me and you've never been to one sporting event during your
time at Cal, here's your chance (if you have, come along for the company).
For those interested, please join me on Jan. 19th. @ 5:00pm when Cal will
take on Washington State.  The tickets look like they are $24.50 per person.
If you are interested, please let me know, so I can try to get a block of
seats together.  

Happy Holidays!!

All the best,

-- Shawne
