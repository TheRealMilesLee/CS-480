Electricity Risk Management 101 Workshop 

And

Portfolio Optimization for Electric Utilities Conference

January 22-25, 2002, New York City, NY

OVERVIEW

 

In the current environment of volatile energy prices and deregulation, it has become increasingly more important for the electricity industry to learn how to manage price risk. EUCI presents two events formatted for the beginner to the expert in price risk management. The first Workshop is designed for the beginner with no prior experience in risk management and introduces the basic vocabulary and concepts in a concise and easily understandable format which forms the foundation for the more advanced concepts applied in the second event (Conference).

Transmission Expansion and Systems in Transition Conference

Feb. 5-8, 2002, Miami, Florida

OVERVIEW

 

This conference will examine the business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC's RTO initiatives.  The conference will review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and regional trading system.
