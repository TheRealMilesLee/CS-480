FYI -  Elizabeth forwarded the letter attached below to the ENA contacts listed along with a courtesy copy to Citizens.  The amount of the reservation payments that are outstanding and will revert back to Citizens is $205,755.  Citizens recalled this capacity on 11/30/2001 and will pay TW directly for December business.
