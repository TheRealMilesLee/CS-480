Dear,

I am the head of Accounts and Audit Department of Bank of Africa,
Ouagadougou .In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $30.5m US 
dollars (Thirty million, five hundred thousand US dollars). In an account 
that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire 
family in 1998 in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, 
we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money 
because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin 
or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but 
unfortunately we learnt that his supposed next of kin(his son and wife) died 
alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim 
.It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my 
department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the 
money to you as the next of kin (We want to present you as his business 
associate )to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since 
nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed Bill. I will give you more vital details when I 
receive your call or response for security reasons. I expect that you call 
me on my private line +226 76 527576 for more details immediately  you 
receive this letter.

Yours faithfully,

DR ABDUL ZABUDAGA
Accounts & Audit Department ,
Bank of Africa

Nb. Also give me your telephone and fax numbers for easy communication with 
you.
