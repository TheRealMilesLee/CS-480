To correct the list I gave you as to ELFI: Jeff, you are the President and COO; Mike, you are the Chairman & CEO.

Jeff, by the way, Enron Intelligence Exchange (a Cayman entity) was formed in 2000 by the LNG group to be a company to participate in the internet trading of LNG. Obviously, no activites to date. I still need to find out the purpose of Enron Administrative Services Corp. I will let you know tomorrow.

Regards, Alan
