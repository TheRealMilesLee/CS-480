Monika:  if you have questions regarding HIB visas, have you checked the Intranet web site on the Enron Home page as there are Merger Q&A's out there regarding visa issues.  If you have a question not answered, please send me an email, and I will get it answered for you.

If you need to see me for something else, I won't be able to see you until Thursday morning.
Let me know
Margaret
