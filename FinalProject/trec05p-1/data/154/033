Apologies just got back.  Can't make the call, but concur that we ought
to stay where we were.  Not that the proposal doesn't merit discussion,
but it raises many issues and we're down to the wire.  So I concur with
Bill and Aaron.  Perhaps we should try to regroup first thing in the AM?

Best,
Jeff

All,

Unfortunately, Aaron and I will not be able to make this call.  However,
we
wanted to let the group know that we are strongly opposed to New West's
proposal and urge the group to adopt the position we agreed to during
last
week's call, i.e., oppose the UDCs' proposal for a DASR cut-off date,
for
the reasons outlined in Dan's most recent draft.

Thanks.

Bill

I have had an opportunity to talk to most of you regarding the attached 
proposal.  I apologize I ran out of time yesterday and didn't catch
everyone.

NWE would like to propose a slightly different take on our AREM filing
having had a chance to think more about it.  I wanted to run it by
everyone
to get your thoughts before submitting a redline.  If you feel this
warrants
a conference call I will gladly set one up for today.  Time is of the
essence and would appreciate your feedback as soon as possible.  If we
all
agree, I would like to get the re-write with everyone's blessing to Dan
by
tomorrow at 8:00 am. or sooner.  
 <<arm-puc-plan.doc>> 
Proposal Benefits

	1.	We look more reasonable and agree to much of what UDCs
are
proposing.
	2.	Accommodates most, if not all, of ESP and customer
concerns.
	3.	Strong argument for avoiding any contract review.    Our
verification proposal could backfire; PUC could accept our approach, but
add
details which goes toward ESPs submitting contracts to the PUC for
review
and validation 
Thank you,
