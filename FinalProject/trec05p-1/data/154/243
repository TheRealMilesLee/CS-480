Mr. Lay,

These are tough times for our company.  There is a lot of justified anger and deep disappointment among our employees and shareholders.  However, at this time I want to thank you for sticking with us and helping to get the best deal for Enron.  You could have washed your hands, walked away and left us holding the bag.  But, you did not. It is reassuring that you are a CEO who will take the heat and do what is best for the company.  It measures the true character of the man.

It is unfortunate that you placed so much faith in those who have brought our company down.  However, it shows that you like the rest of us are only human.  I've admired your work over the years and am honored I was able to be a part of your organization.  I pray that God will be with you during this turmoil and He will give you strength to see it through. 

I will always remember my days at Enron with pride.  I enjoyed the many great men and women I worked with.  Thank you again, Mr. Lay, for all you have done.

Jane Gustafson
