You might add the following:

Utility Processing Risk  -  will the utilities try to reject contracts that
are pre-Sept 20 but which are DASR'd afterwards for one reason or another,
or will the utilities try to impose other restrictive requirements to limit
the number of post July 1 contracts they must switch to DA?

Confidentiality Issues _ As part of their policing responsibility on this
issue, the utilities will likely try to insist on seeing all post July 1 DA
contracts, including sensitive provisions, and we will have to resist giving
sensitive commercial information.

Before providing more elaborate descriptions, wanted to try to get a
complete--but stripped-down--list of the key risk areas.  Please add
anything I may have missed, send it back, and I'll take a shot at
fleshing it out.

Thanks,
Jeff
