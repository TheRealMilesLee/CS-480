Hector -

I have been out of the office and just received this.  Your thoughts?  Should we just give Mike a Severance Package?

Mr. Herndon,

I met with Messrs Hector McLoughlin and Scott Mills on Friday.  Per Mr. McLoughlin, my position in your group has not "materialized," which is not an elimination of position.  I was offered 30 days (calendar days) to look for a position within Enron, and, at the conclusion of that period, if I do not secure a position, I would be given one month of pay for a separation agreement.  [The terms of the separation agreement was not presented to me.]  The meeting was intimidating and humiliating.

Mr. McLoughlin stated that the management (Beth Apollo and Scott Mills) is giving me this ultimatum.  I am about to be unemployed in a depressed economy with one month of pay.

None of the participants in the Friday meeting was able to clarify the difference between elimination of a position versus a position that did not "materialize."  Perhaps you can explain the difference to me.  I believe ordinary and prudent Americans would see this as an elimination my job at Enron.

Query: Can you tell me why my position in your group has been eliminated?  

Query: Why am I being treated differently versus some of the other members of Risk Analysis such as Brian Butler, who was awarded a position in your group?  Why am I not offered the standard severance package but given an abbreviated version?  Simply, why am I not treated fairly?

Query: Do you believe I have been treated fairly?  My position with a commercial organization has been eliminated, and I am a pariah in commercial support organization.  I do not have a fair chance at year-end PRC even if I land a position at Enron.  I face an uncertain future near the end of the year in an highly uncertain and depressed economy without employment.  

What I rightfully deserve as a loyal employee of Enron for the past three and a half years is what other Enron employees are entitled to and have received.  I do not see a single shred of reason why I should be treated differently than other employees of Enron.  I believe I deserve the standard severance package that other Enron employees receive when their position has been eliminated.

Finally, I would like to present some thoughts before I close.  Mr. McLoughlin mentioned the term, "employment at-will."  Yes, I understand what that term represents.  I am perfectly content with that term as long as the term is interpreted and applied to me as it is interpreted and applied to other Enron employees.  Yes, I am a weak person in front of mighty Enron management, but I am a human being.  I deserve respect like everyone else at Enron.  I believe I am due the response to my inquiry.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,

Michael S. Kim
