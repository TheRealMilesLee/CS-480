Lee, please review the following offer to Pemex for firm transportation on TW.  I would like you to review the language I have inserted and see if you would like to add to it before I send it to Steve to review.   I also want a few other people to see it before I send to Pemex.  My goal is to get this out tomorrow.  Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks, Kim.
