Bruce Tatro responded quickly and effectively to my needs during a year when we were living in his district.  That says something about how great it would be if Neartown had its own council person and state representative, depending on us for votes.

It's funny how different people have different experiences.  We have had numerous problems with the water lines in front of our home--the last resulted in a $798 water bill and we were told to fix it ourselves (get a plumber, actually), even though the city broke and then repaired (?) the line a month earlier. 

Anyway, to make a long story short, I used the e-mail list of city councilpersons that Annise supplied to send out an appeal for help.  EVERY councilperson--EXCEPT BRUCE TATRO--responded immediately!  (Annise's office was particularly caring--Thank you!)  The city repaired the problem within one day and refunded $762 to us. 

Thanks to EMCA's newsgroup and Annise Parker's list, I guess it IS possible to fight city hall!

Subject: *EMCA* Storefront 




I tried again today, Monday, to reach Sgt. Vollert or some competent person 
at the storefront with no luck.  In the year or so while we were living in 
Spring Branch Bruce Tatro, who I hope will be mayor some day, responded to 
a police problem we were having in the neighborhood by sending an HPD 
sergeant (who I hope will be police chief some day) to our house who told 
me how hard it is to get any work out of many HPD officers and how even 
harder it is to fire them.
