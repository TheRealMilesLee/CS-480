Comrades: 

Diane is leaving us, alas, and no amount of begging, pleading, cajolery, whining, bribery or blackmail seems to have dissuaded her from her resolve to go. Like so many weeping children, handerchiefs waving in between noseblows and dabbing of eyes, shamelessly clinging to her skirts, we would all go to bid her farewell at the airport, but we dare not lest airport security be thrown into a tizzy by such a demonstration. 

Therefore, we have decided to bid her farewell in a more seemly fashion, in the privacy of our own campus, where we may emote extravagantly without undue and embarassing scrutiny from the outside world.   

The EMBA office, as frugal as they normally are, along with the Evening MBA Association (your government in action working for YOU) are jointly sponsoring a little whingding where we may laugh through our tears in celebration of Diane's wonderful years and grand successes at Haas, and send her off to Colorado with lots of hugs and kisses.   


THURSDAY, the 27th

WELLS FARGO ROOM

7:30 until whenever

(tell your professor there are more important things than positive NPV projects)

and, yes, food and drink are provided so that you won't faint in the second half of class from lack of nourishment.
