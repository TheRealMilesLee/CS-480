Please print and initial the attached consent we have been working on for these past, what seems like, years.

 
Also, please print and initial the two consent attached below.

The first is a consent cleans up all of the POA's and Special Appts for ENA.  As you will recall, Kim Theriot researched all of the POA's and Special Appts at the indirect urging of Mark Haedicke.  This consent removes all all but seven individuals as Agents and Attorneys-In-Fact.

 
This second consent, language provided by Marie Heard, authorizes 15 individuals on a going forward basis.  Please note, about 7 of these individuals were removed, or had their powers revoked in the previous consent.  It appears that as the trading group would send up consents to replace previous powers, they were added again instead.

 

These should bring ENA as up to speed as we can make it.

Thanks,

Mx
