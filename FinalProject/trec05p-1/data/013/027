NESA/HEA is headed to Dallas!  Whether you live, work or just have customers
in Dallas, you'll want to take advantage of every opportunity to join us on
Monday, August 20th at Cityplace, just outside downtown Dallas to hear TRRC
Chairman MICHAEL L. WILLIAMS present an update on the state of the energy
industry in Texas!

A strong conservative appointed by former Governor George W. Bush, Chairman
Williams has been designated as the TRRC's "point person" for regulatory
reform and technology modernization.  He's an informative and highly
entertaining speaker, so make your plans now to attend.

Cityplace is located at 2711 N. Haskell, and registration will begin at
11:30 a.m. in the foyer of the Turtle Creek I Ballroom.  Lunch service
begins at noon and the Chairman will speak at 12:30 p.m.  For directions to
Cityplace, please call 214/828-7050.

NESA/HEA members pay only $35 in advance, or $40 at the door.  Members can
also purchase corporate tables of ten for $300 if your registration is
received by August 15th.  All registrations received wishing to pay at the
door will be billed if you do not attend. Non-members pay $50 or can pay $75
which includes NESA/HEA membership through 2001.  

Fax in the bottom portion of this message with your credit card payment or
mail with your check to NESA/HEA headquarters.  Don't delay!  This is
expected to be a sell-out, so register today!  See you on the 20th in
Dallas!
