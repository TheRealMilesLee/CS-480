Steve, et al,

What is the status of Tex-Mex, and who are the responsible parties?  Is this an ENA project, and EES project, an EdM project, or is is joint?

There has been very little communication or coordination from EdM to date.  Word is that committments are being made by EdM, and it is not certain that those committments have been shared with those who will have to fulfill them.

Can you please clarify the situation?

Also, since Drew Tingleaf has left the company, who has been assigned to fill that role?

If Enron is going to be faced with committments on this project, it would be prudent to keep those involved informed.

Perhaps there is nothing to be concerned about, but it's better to ask now than to find we've missed something later.

Thanks!
