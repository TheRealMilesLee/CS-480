Brad/Jay,

Based upon discussions with legal, operations and IT we have come up with a recommended solution for the customer list issue.  Below is an outline of our recommended procedure for dealing with price hosting arrangements on EnronOnline.  We will continue to hammer down the details but wanted your approval prior to implementing this process.  We would like to implement immediately after finalizing details.

1. Mark Taylor and Barbra Gray will draft a new Password Application which acknowledges third party price postings on EnronOnline.  Beginning immediately new customers will receive the amended Password Application.  

2. Mark Taylor and Barbra Gray will draft language for a customer pop up box which does the following: (1) Acknowledges the addition of third party price postings (2) requests permission to supply third party price posters with their company name (3) warrants that the acknowledging party has the authority to accept the new terms.

3. Mark Taylor and Barbra Gray will draft language for the third party GTC that amends the Password Application and ETA to cover the company who is posting that product type on EnronOnline. Before a company is able to transact on the third party product type, they will need to read and sign the GTC with third party language.  If the third party has already signed an GTC type agreement with the third party price poster, they will still see an amendment to the signed agreement which amends their Password Application and ETA to include the third party when they first try to transact.  Before the customer is able to transact they will need to read and sign the GTC amendment.  

3. Jay will put language from 2 above in a pop up window that only goes to Master Users. 

4. We will put the pop up on for at least one day and then gauge the number of response to determine how long to show pop up.  Marketing will contact as many master users as possible prior to pop up display.

5. We will distribute company names to third party price posters for profiling.

6.  When third party postings go live we will contact Master Users to inform them that they need to approve transaction status for third party product types (normal process for new product type launches).

Please let me know if this is ok.
