How was your little grab ass weekend with the Angel of Death?  Sorry to hear
about the house, I know what a bummer it is to lose a contract.  Hopefully
someone else will come along and take it off your hands.  Are you still
considering renting it or are you committed to selling?

My sister gave birth last weekend to a little boy, however he was about 4
months premature.  We're all pulling for him but it is still touch and go at
this point.

School is challenging but interesting and the flying is awesome so I'm
pretty happy.  Bought a used BMW motorcycle yesterday - a '71 off of the
original owner.  It's a classic and will give me something to tinker with on
the weekends.

Hope all is well,
