Hi Dotty:
Sent this to Jim at the email address you gave me, but it got bounced
back to me.  Are you positive this is his email address?  Could you try
forwarding?  Also, if it's easier and you just want to give me his phone
number, that'll work, too.  Thanks so much again for your help.

Best,
Jeff
