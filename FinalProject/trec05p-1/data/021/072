Mark,

Hello, my name is Zach Streight and I am working in Brad Richter's group trying to monetize DealBench.   We need to add a legal disclaimer to the front of our pitch book and Brad suggested I contact you.  He thought you probably would have some standard ones on file that we could use.  If you wouldn't mind letting me know if and when you could put something together for me I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks
Zach
