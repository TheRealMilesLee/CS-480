Dear Professor Bruner and Ms. Fisher,
 
We have reviewed the web cast from the Darden website of outtakes from Jeff's speech and interview at the Batten Institute event in May.
 
First let me say that both the audio and visual technical issues associated with the first version appear to have been remedied on your end--he now comes across loud and clear!
 
Further, we respectfully request the following edits:
 

In the "Idea" section, under subpart 4, please end the audio after the sentence: "Innovation made money and significant amount of money".  
In the "California" section, under subpart 1, please end the audio after the sentence: "So it's not a surprise that there is a problem".
In the "California" section, under subpart 5, please end the audio after the sentence: "So I think you're gonna see a big expansion in wind-generator electricity". 

Thank you for your cooperation in making these edits.  If you have any questions, please call either me or Ursula Brenner.
 
Best regards,
 
Christie Patrick.
