Just a quick note to give you the news.  Brenda and I had a little boy named Donald James Heelan Powell (a.k.a. Jimmy Powell) on Friday, July 27, 2001.
 
He takes after his old man and has a tremendously large head.  As a result, he had to come out the side door.  Brenda is doing well and recovering amazingly from the C-section.  
 
Jimmy is doing just as well.  If you want to take a look at a funny picture of our little guy (2 days old), go to:

It looks like he just caught someone stealing his parachute.
