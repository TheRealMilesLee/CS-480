Thanks for thinking of sending this to me as I always appreciate any California regulatory data.  This report came out in May and is known as the CEC's "White Paper" on the CA Natural Gas Infrastructure.  After Com. Woods appointment at FERC, the CEC made sure he was aware of their paper and forwarded it to FERC.  The primary thrust of the paper is in line with our position that SoCal and PG&E need to expand their take-away capacity at the border.  Interestingly the FERC issued a similar finding after the Technical Conference on the same subject was held in Wash. DC.
I don't expect the CEC to do much of anything with the paper beyond the press they got for identifying one of the causes for the price spike and a shortage of gas into the state.  Let me know if you have any other questions.  gh

Glen,

This is very interesting reading.  Please read this (sorry, it's kind of long) and let me know if it meshes with what you think is happening in California.  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,
Thanks again to you and Lorraine for a wonderful time at lunch yesterday. I
hope we can do it on a much more regular basis. Here is the web site with
the CEC report I was referring to yesterday. I think this is a useful
reference; the FERC is giving it some serious thought as well.

Amy
