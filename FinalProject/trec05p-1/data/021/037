Dear Friend,

Compliment of the season.I got to know of you in search for
a
reputable and reliable person to assist me in an urgent
need requiring 
utmost
trust and confidentiality. 


I am PRINCE.JOHN PHILIP, the manager in the FOREIGN
REMMITTANCE DEPT. of UNION BANK PLC. I am writing this
letter to ask 
for your
support and co-operation to carry out this business
opportunity in my
department.

We discovered an abandoned sum of ($30million)
Thirty-Million 
Dollars Only in an account that belongs to one of our
foreign customer 
Late
Mr.Robert Ebner,who died along with his entire family of a
wife and 
three
children in October 31, 1999 in a plane crash.Since we
heard of his 
death, 
we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and put
claims for 
his
money as the heir, because we can not release the fund from
his account
unless someone applies for the claims as the next of kin to
the 
deceased as
indicated in our banking guidelines.

Unfortunately, neither their family member nor distant
relatives 
has ever appeared to claim the fund.Upon this discovery,I
and other 
officials 
in my department have agreed to make a deal with you and
release the 
fund into your account as the NEXT OF KIN of the decease,
since no one 
came 
for it or discovered the maintained account with our Bank
otherwise the 
fund will be returned to the bank?s treasury as
unclaimed fund. Please 
visit
http://www.greatdreams.com/PassEAir990.htm
for your confirmation of the death of The money will be
paid into 
your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and
my 
colleages,
and 35% for you,while 5% will be for expenses both parties
might have
incurred during the process of the transferring.

After the successful completion of this transaction,one of
my 
colleaguesand I will come to your country and mind our
percentage.It is 
from 
our share we intend to import medical equipments into my
country as a 
way of
recycling the fund. To commence this transaction, we
require you to 
immediately indicate your interest if this proposal is OK.
by you or 
you do not wish to 
take advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you,then
kindly reach 
me
through my private email address(johncc@atlas.cz).
On getting your response and willingness to do this
business with me
and my colleagues,i will then inform you on how we go
further in the
transactions. 


NOTIFICATION:THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE ,FOR YOUR 
INFORMATION
AND
ASSURANCE TO AVOID BEIGN SCARED ABOUT THE TRANSACTIONS.

I await your immediate response,through  my  email address
,john_php2003@yahoo.co.in

Best Regards.
PRINCE.JOHN PHILIP 
Manager.
UNION BANK PLC
