Attention

RE: YOUR ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED IN ACTUALIZING THIS GOAL

Let me start by introducing myself to you, I am Coker Kent, Director 
Credit Control unit, ABN AMBRO BANK AMSTERDAM NETHERLANDS.I got your 
address during my private search in the Internet and I want to believe that,you will be very honest, committed and capable of assisting in this business venture.

Firstly, let me explain the source of this funds and what you are expected to do. A foreigner LATE ENGR. PAUL MCKINNEY, an oil merchant/contractor with the government of Netherlands, until his death,years ago, was a victim of Kenya airway: bus (a310-300) flight kq430,plane crash. The deceased, Engineer PAUL MCKINNEY banked with us,and has a closing balance as at July 2001 worth $24.5m (Twenty four million five hundred thousand usd). Which My bank, now expects a next-of-kin,to stand as the beneficiary of the funds, efforts have been made by ABN AMBRO BANK to get in touch with the McKinneys Family or relatives but,to no avail.

Based on the perceived possibility of not being able to locate Engr.Paul McKinneys next-of-kin, the management under the influence of our chairman and the board of directors are making arrangements for the funds to be declared unclaimed and channeled to an unknown account. It is for this reason I have contacted you to stand as the next-of-kin of late Engr. Paul McKinney so that the funds, will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary/next-of-kin to the deceased.

All documents, and proof to enable you get the funds have been carefully worked out as I have secured from the different offices concerned for the smooth transfer of the fund to your nominated account. It has been agreed that the owner of the account will be compensated with 30% of the remitted Funds; while we keep 60% and 10% will be set aside to,upset expenses both locally and international.
If this proposal satisfies you, please reach me by mail 
 for more clarification about how this will be done.

Yours faithfully,
COKER KENT
DIRECTOR OF CREDIT CONTROL UNIT
ABN AMBRO BANK AMSTERDAM NETHERLANDS
