Hakeem and I would like to meet with you all to go over the various Agency deals, and what is
lacking in Sitara to capture these deals correctly.  We would like to meet with you on Wednesday,
August 8, 2001 at 32C2 from 3:30 to 4:30.  Please let me know if you will be able to attend. 
Thanks, Gloria  3-7118
