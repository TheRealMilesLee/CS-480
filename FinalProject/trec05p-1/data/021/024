I'll just continue to solicit feedback from Brett, Chris and Ben every two weeks before we circulate the Turbine Report.  If a meeting is ever scheduled, I would have an interest participating.  Thanks.

WE haven't really had one yet.  The answer is simple - we are trying to sell all of them and pushing as hard as possible.  No luck so far apart from Virgo selling the steam turbine.

Louise,

So I can make our Turbine Position Report as accurate as possible, may I join you, Chris, Brett and Ben for the turbine meeting scheduled for later this week?  I also want to better understand some of the issues surrounding the various pieces of equipment so I relay this to Rick Buy prior to the BoD meeting.

Regards,
