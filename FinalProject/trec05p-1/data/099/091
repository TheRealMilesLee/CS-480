A Daring New Position

Husband: Shall we try a new position tonight?

Wife: Sure. You stand by the ironing board and I'll sit on the couch and
drink
beer and fart!

I hope you enjoyed the above joke.  Come meet me at Marlowe's this Friday,
October 26th for a Complimentary Cosmopolitan!  Smirnoff Raspberry will be
at Marlowe's this Friday between 4:30 and 7:00pm to buy everyone with this
e-mail a complimentary Cosmopolitan.  Just present a copy of this e-mail to
your bartender and enjoy a Cosmo with me. It's that easy!  I'll see you
Friday!

 
-Liza

Remember to fill out your Redhook Treasure Chest entry form too; the next
Treasure Chest opens November 9th!

Limit is one complimentary Cosmo per person.
