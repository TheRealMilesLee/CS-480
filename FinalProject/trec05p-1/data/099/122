Steve:

Spoke with your assistant and have scheduled you to meet with the banks at 1:30pm regarding short term liquidity facility.  Listed below are the questions that the bank has sent to us.  Ben Glisan asked if you would please discuss these items.  Thanks.

1)	Update on FERC proceedings:
a)	Schedule for both CA and Pacific Northwest refund hearings
b)	What is ENE's exposure to potential CA / Pacific Northwest refunds?
c)	Does ENE expect FERC to investigate its affiliate relationships (e.g. El Paso)?
	What differentiates ENE from EPG?
