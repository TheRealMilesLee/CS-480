Subject: [Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Chrebet OUT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hi Folks,

Real quick:   New York Jets WR Wayne Chrebet will miss this week's game as
he's recovering from his concussion.   Most indications are that he'll be
able to go next week.   WR Matthew Hatchette will become the other WR
opposite Laveranues Coles and should do well.   Hatchette's been looking for
an opportunity and this could well be it.

More as we hear it.

Joe


Thanks to Footballguy Kelly Carlton for pointing me to this one.
