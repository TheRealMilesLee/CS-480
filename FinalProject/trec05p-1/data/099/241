Mark,

Per my voice mail, I would be very grateful if you or someone in your department could give this confirmation letter a quick review before lunch.  The intent of the deal is that we will pay Deseret a fixed price in exchange for a floating price based on the DJ-PV index.  However, if Deseret's plant goes down, then both parties will suspend payments the day following the unit outage, and resume payments once the unit comes back online.  If the index turns out to be greater than our fixed payment, we will pay Deseret  50% of the delta between the index and the fixed price.  

Please call or e-mail me with your comments.  My number is (503) 464-7795.

Thanks so much,

Steve
