If you have not yet had the opportunity to enroll for the 2002 CFA exam, AIMR is pleased to announce that you now can do so electronically through the AIMR Web site at http://www.aimr.org/cfaprogram/index.html.

The next enrollment deadline is 3 December 2001 and, as a reminder, this year AIMR must RECEIVE your enrollment form and payment by the deadline date.

Many CFA candidates have inquired about the status of the New York Society, which had its office in the World Trade Center. We are happy to report that all NYSSA staff escaped safely on 11 September, that the organization is relocating to midtown Manhattan, and that is up and running with a full slate of educational programs. Visit http://www.nyssa.org for information about NYSSA's Fall and Spring continuing education and CFA review courses, and seminars.
