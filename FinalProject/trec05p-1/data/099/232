DEAR SIR, 
I AM DR GODSON EZUMA, THE BILLS AND EXCHANGE DIRECTOR OF
THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPARTMENT OF UNION BANK NIGERIA
LIMITED. I AM WRITING THIS
LETTER TO SOLICIT FOR SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE FROM YOU
TO CARY OUT THIS BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY IN MY
DEPARTMENT. 
LYING IN AN INACTIVE ACCOUNT IS THE SUM OF
$15.5MILLION USD BELONGING TO A FOREIGN CUSTOMER
(MR.MARTIN WALL) WHO HAPPENS TO BE DECEASED. HE
DIED WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN IN A PLANE CRASH
ON BOARD AN ADC AIRLINE FLIGHT AT THE EGIRIN
RIVER-LAGOS NIGERIA IN NOVEMBER 1997. EVER SINCE HE
DIED THE BANK HAS BEEN EXPECTING HIS NEXT OF KIN TO
COME AND CLAIM THESE FUNDS. TO THIS EFFECT WE CAN NOT
RELEASE THE MONEY UNLESS SOMEONE APPLIES FOR IT AS
NEXT OF KIN, AS INDICATED IN OUR BANKING GUIDE 
LINE. UNFORTUNATELY HE HAS NO FAMILY MEMBERS IN
NIGERIA OR ANYWHERE WHO IS AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF
THE MONEY (AS HE WAS A CONTRACTOR WITH THE FEDERAL
REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA).
AT THIS JUNCTURE I HAVE DECIDED TO DO BUSINESS WITH
YOU IN COLLABORATION WITH TWO OTHER OFFICIALS IN THE
BANK, TO THIS EFFECT WE SOLICIT YOUR HELP IN APPLYING
AS THE NEXT OF KIN THEN THE MONEY WILL BE RELEASED
INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.
WE DO NOT WANT THIS MONEY TO GO INTO THE BANKS
TREASURY AS AN UNCLAIMED BILL. THE BANKING LAW AND
GUIDE LINE STIPULATES THAT: IF SUCH MONEY(S) REMAINS
UNCLAIMED FOR A PERIOD OF UP TO SEVEN YEARS (7 YEARS)
THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERRED IN TO THE BANKS TREASURY
AS UNCLAIMED FUNDS. OUR REQUEST FOR A FOREIGNER AS
NEXT OF KIN IS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE
CUSTOMER WAS A FOREIGNER AND A NIGERIAN CANNOT STAND
AS NEXT OF KIN. 30 PERCENT OF THE MONEY WILL BE YOUR
SHARE AS FOREIGN PARTNER. THEREAFTER MY COLLEAGUES AND
I WILL VISIT YOUR COUNTRY WITH YOUR HELP ONCE THE
MONEY HITS YOUR ACCOUNT FOR DISBURSEMENT ACCORDING TO
THE AGREED SHARING PARTTERN OF 30% FOR YOU, 10% FOR
INCIDENTAL EXPENSES BOTH LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL AND
60% FOR MY GROUP. YOUR URGENT RESPONSE IS BEIGN
EXPECTED.  YOU ARE REQUIRED TO FURNISH ME WITH THE BELOW
INFORMATION-
1)FULL NAME AND ADDRESS
2)TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER
PLS REPLY TO  MY ALTERNATIVE BOX(godsonezuma_ubn@yahoo.com)
THANKS AND BEST REGARDS, 
YOURS FAITHFULLY, 
DR FRANCIS AMAH
