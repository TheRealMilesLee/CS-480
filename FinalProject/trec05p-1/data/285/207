<LI><FONT face=Verdana><STRONG>Global Cedar:</STRONG> On June 1, Energy and 
Asset Technology announced the acquisition of Tumlit Pine Furniture along with 
plans to continue to operate their new subsidiary under the name Global Cedar. 
They currently manufacture over 110 furniture products. First year revenues are 
expected to total approximately $6 million, and the company is convinced 
that <STRONG><FONT color=#cc0000>it is possible for the annual revenues to 
exceed $60 million in the next three to four years.</FONT></STRONG>

Energy and Asset Technology presently owns a controlling interest in Panpacific 
Development Funds, Ltd., a registered Pooled Development Fund (PDF). PDFs 
offer a number of significant tax concessions to investors as dividends are 
exempt from income tax and dividend withholding tax, and capital gains are also 
exempt from capital gains tax. <STRONG><FONT color=#cc0000>During the four years 
culminating in 2003, PDFs had returned an investment gain of $95 million on an 
initial investment of $107 million!!!</FONT></STRONG></FONT> </LI></DIV>

<DIV align=justify>
<LI><FONT face=Verdana><STRONG>FluxStar: </STRONG>Under an exclusive agreement, 
EGTY plans to manufacture and market a simple magnetic device that enhances the 
efficiency of AC and DC motors. It is anticipated that the FluxStar Magnetic 
Source of Power will provide an alternative source of energy and power for homes 
around the world. <STRONG><FONT color=#cc0000>The objective of this technology 
is to eventually eliminate utility bills for the end 
user.</FONT></STRONG></FONT> </LI></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><FONT face=Verdana color=#cc0000></FONT></STRONG> </DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<LI><FONT face=Verdana><STRONG>Global Cedar:</STRONG> in addition to 
manufacturing furniture, the company intends to sell and distribute its 
proprietary product, the Global Cedar Tree, in order to foster the growth of 
plantations that provide timber for construction, furniture building, wood pulp, 
and other products. The tree grows well in a variety of climactic conditions, 
and the plantlets contain no contaminants and are subject to no known 
import/export restrictions. Therefore, the marketability of this product is 
extremely high.</FONT> </LI></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Verdana></FONT> </DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<LI><FONT face=Verdana>The Global Cedar Tree is the result of 14 years of 
research and genetic technology development. <STRONG><FONT color=#cc0000>It 
is the fastest growing hardwood tree on the planet, capable of achieving growth 
levels of 30-35 feet in its first year alone!</FONT></STRONG> After just the 
first year, the tree can be harvested and will re-grow from the stump, providing 
multiple harvests for years. The timber produced is excellent for fine furniture 
and other uses for which the wood of fast growing soft woods is unsuitable. The 
potential benefits of the tree are legion, from positive effects on the ozone 
and a buffer against rainforest depletion, as world demand for wood products 
continues to outpace world supply. </FONT></LI></DIV>
