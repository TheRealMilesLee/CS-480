I heard an interview w/ Geddy and Alex, and they said they were dropping some songs they have been playing on the past several tours to play some much older stuff.  Although, the last tour was very cool when they played the whole side one of 2112 all the way through.
 
Yes, Ted has been the coolest person I've ever seen in concert.  Not the best concert, but that guy is just cool... and, I've always wanted a loin cloth like his.

I thought about that, I could really get up for a RUSH shindig,......although that new song they're playing on the FM really sucks........."for those who think and feel..."
 
BTW, I saw Nugent open up for KISS on their second to last farewell tour and he 
was F@$#^%&*#..ing awesome!!  Now that brought back some old thoughts.

Man, you're not supposed to ask for money on a Friday afternoon!!  Save that
for Mondays!

Anybody up for RUSH?!?!?  Coming Friday August 16th.  Could be a blast from
the past.  We can act like teenagers again, although the recovery could take
all weekend.  I'll need to try and find my old "NUGENT" concert shirt I wore
for my entire 8th grade year to truly replicate my teenage years.

What's the deal. No traffic all week. Makes coming to work really lame.

Here's something to talk about. Karnes City!!! Like it is time to cut checks

again and mail them to the opielas before they call me and hit me up for a
raise on our rent.

John:Last year looks like the break down was as follows: you wrote a ckedk
to Rancho Grande Trust for 2,600 and collected from Mark and Matt. I wrote
one for 900 and collected from pig, shet, smack, hudge and senior
saftey.

SO Brian, Chet, Chad, Hudge and Joe need to cut me a check for 150 a piece
and mail it to my office 815 walker #1447 H/T 77002.

If you are not interested in getting back on, let me know so I can fill your

spot.

John, mail your check and I will send off with mine and contract for emerick
