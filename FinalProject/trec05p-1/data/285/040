Law Chamber Principal Attorney
Terry Edmond & Associates
44, Kofo Abayomi Avenue,
Victoria Island,
Lagos-Nigeria.

Dear Sir/Madam, 

Kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to
you. I believe you are a highly respected personality,
considering the fact that I sourced your profile from a
human resource profile database on your country. Though, I
do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and
fragile.

I am Barrister Terry Edmond, a Solicitor. I am the Personal
Attorney to Mr. Robert Mcdowell. who used to work with Agip
Oil Company in Nigeria. Early this year,My client his wife
and two children lost their lives in the Tsunami Asia
Disaster when he went for an official assignment.

Since then I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to
locate any of my client's relatives, this has also proved
unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I
decided to trace his relatives over the Internet to locate
any member of his family but to no avail, hence, I
contacted you to assist in repatriating the money left
behind by my client in a Bank. Particularly, the Finance
House where the deceased deposited the US$15 Million
(Fifteen Million United States Dollars only) knows me very
well and has given me the mandate tp present the Next of
Kin to my client since I am hos personal Attorney.

Consequently, this Bank issued me a notice to provide the
Next of Kin to claim the US$15 Million (Fifteen Million
United States Dollars only) in their custody within the
next ten official working days. Since I have been
unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 2 years
now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin
of the deceased to claim the fund as the Next of Kin to him
so that the Bank will transfer the fund to your account.

Upon receipt of the fund, I will come over to your country
to meet with you for the disbursement of the fund and then
you and I will share the money in this order: 70% will be
for me, 30% will be for you. I have all the necessary legal
documents that can back our claim we may make with the
Bank.

All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us
seeing this deal through. I guarantee that this will be
executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect
you from any breach of the law. 

Best regards.

Terry Edmond
Principal Attorney
