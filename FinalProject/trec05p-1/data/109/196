I think we should keep the $6.00 offers. Natsource can get us done at $5.00 Do you remember what the total volumes are for this deal?

Kinko's wants their pricing refreshed for their Reliant and TXU sites only.
I need to know the fixed $MWh price if we assume a 50% renewable product in TXU
and a 100% renewable product in Reliant's service area.
I am trying to fill out the attached template that Larry sent to me with my gen only price refreshed,
some Price to beat estimates I ran for him and your new renewable power quotes.
Thanks
Kay
