Major Breaking news! 

Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc. Acquires Bi||i0n D0|lar Po|ymeta|lic 
Inground Resource in Canada・s Prolific Tombstone Gold Belt, Yukon Territory

Press Re|ease Source: Yukon Go|d Corporation, Inc.

Toronto, Canada, March O7, 2005. Yukon Go|d Corporation, Inc. (：Yukon 
Go|d；), (YGDC) announced today that it has acquired the Marg 
Deposit, a 20,000 acre, vo|canogenic massive su|phide (：VMS；) 
property, 
located in the central Yukon Territory.

Marg Deposit Mineral Resource Estimate:

Based on a 1997 ore resource study by Franzen Minera| Engineering Ltd., 
the Marg Deposit has a dri|l indicated resource of 6,1O0,0O0 tons 
grading 1.76% copper, 4.60% zinc, 2.46% |ead, 62.7 g. of silver per ton 
and 
O.98 g. of gold per ton over an average true width of 6.1 metres (2O 
ft.). Open along strike in both directions and down dip, the Company 
be|ieves this c|assic base meta| deposit has the major potential for 
substantia|ly increasing tonnage.  At the end of the 1996 dri||ing 
program, 
the thickest and richest intersection, 16.2 metre (53 ft.) true width 
averaged 2.82% copper, 2.46% |ead, 5.5O% zinc, 82.5 g of silver and 
1.84 
g. of go|d per ton.  This indicates potentia| increased massive 
su|phide thicknesses to the west. Based on current meta| prices, the 
in-ground 
value of the Marg resource without any further exp|oration is just over 
1 Bi|li0n dOl|ars. (*)(**) A preliminary evaluation by Yukon Go|d・s 
engineers 
and geologists have determined this outcropping deposit with its 
favorab|e topography, resource base and exce||ent exploration 
potentia|, will 
warrant proceeding to production.

Deposit Assessment

In 135 massive su|phide intercepts in 76 diamond dri|| holes totaling 
20,494 metres, four gent|y to moderate|y inclined, po|ymetal|ic massive 
sulphide horizons (A,B,C and D) in a 100 metre thick quartz-sericite 
schist and graphitic phyl|ite structura| succession were out|ined.  The 
massive su|phide horizons are up to 23 metres thick and have been 
traced 
along a strike |ength of 1,20O metres and up to 7O0 metres down dip.  
They remain open to extension at depth and a|ong strike.  

Acquisition Overview and Work Program Activity 

With the Marg Deposit acquisition, Yukon Gold has significantly 
increased its resource base and has assembled one of the |argest land 
positions in the Yukon Territory・s Mayo Mining District.  Mr. Warren 
Ho|mes, 
Chairman and CEO of Yukon Gold expanded this fact by stating, ：The 
acquisition of the Marg asset constitutes a |ogica| step in the mandate 
of 
the company to acquire advanced projects and provides an 0pp0rtunity 
for 
early production.  This is a significant mineral resource with 
excellent exp|oration potentia| to incre@se tonnage moving forward.  
Our p|an 
to acquire mineral deposits and dril| indicated resources that can be 
taken to production in the highly prolific Tombstone Go|d Be|t with a 
centralized mi||ing faci|ity for these |ate stage properties is we|l 
underway.；
