Stacey and Jeff, I sent the attached message to obtain Mr. Lavorato's signature on the attached authorized trader lists.  I have not received one back and would greatly appreciate any help you can provide in updating  the list and identifying those individuals authorized to trade with brokers and the firm's name.  Can you please help me, we have received requests from broker's for our updated list.  Please call me at ext. 31939 with any questions.  Thanks so much for your help.  Donna Lowry

Frank, for the first submission of the authorized trader list from me and my group, we would greatly appreciate it if you would take the attached list to Mr. Lavorato for his signature.  Attached is the Cross Commodity and East Power groups.  Do we need to have him sign any others?  We are sending Tim Belden the list for West Power.  Please advise.  The message below is one that we will in the normal course of this process send to the heads to sign.  Any suggestions or improvements?  Donna

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enclosed for your review and approval (with necessary modifications) is the most recent authorized trader list.  RAC Compliance will forward all future requests for this information to you on a quarterly basis.  If any changes occur to this list during the interim period, please follow the requirements in the Risk Management Policy and forward a new list to my attention at EB 2407.

Additionally, we will be compiling appropriate trader list for brokers by product.  Please indicate either on the attached list or provide a separate list indicating those individuals authorized to trade with a broker along with the firm name.

If you have any questions regarding this process or the attached, please contact me at extension 3-1939.
