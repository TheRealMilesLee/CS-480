Technology Daily is a Web-based news service focused on IT politics and policy and publishes two editions every weekday. 

Each morning (9 am), the AM Edition provides you with "coverage of the coverage" -- a news briefing drawn from hundreds of print, online and broadcast sources. 

Every afternoon (4 pm), the PM Edition delivers original reporting on breaking news and hot-button policy developments. 


What is the Future of Tech Policy?
