Kim & John:
       This Saturday night, the Great Gourmand Dinner Club is gathering to 
recognize the contributions of the legendary Owen Edward Brennan family to 
Creole culinary arts.  We'll meet at 6:00pm at our house at 2001 Barrington 
Pointe, League City, TX 77573.   A map will follow by email.  
      Would you bring the following entree, prepared to serve 10 people?  
Crabmeat Imperial 
1 pound lump crabmeat, picked over to remove any shell and cartilage* 
1/2 cup scallions, finely chopped 
1/2 cup green bell pepper, finely chopped 
1/4 cup chopped pimentos 
1 egg yolk 
1 teaspoon dry mustard 
4 artichoke hearts, coarsely chopped 
2 tablespoons paprika 
1 cup mayonnaise 
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese 
1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs 
Salt and black pepper Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a large bowl, combine 
the crabmeat, scallions, bell pepper, pimento, egg yolk, dry mustard, 
artichoke hearts, paprika and one-half cup of the mayonnaise. Stir until 
well-mixed and season with salt and pepper to taste. 

Spoon the crabmeat mixture into four one-cup baking dishes; then cover with 
the remaining mayonnaise. Sprinkle Parmesan and bread crumbs on top and bake 
in the hot oven for 15 to 20 minutes until heated through. Serve immediately. 

Makes four servings.
