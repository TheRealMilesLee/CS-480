Hi Greg,

Whassup?  I tried to contact you recently via your personal e-mail address, and then by sending you a letter, but got no reply.  I guess your admin staff has you behind their firewall..;~).  Hey, I'm working temorarily on a project here in Dallas until X-Mas, and just talked with Woody Woodmansee this morning.  He gave me your work address.  Said he spoke to you when you were in London recently.

We outta try to hook-up sometime while I'm here in Texas.  Please send me an e-mail or give me a call sometime, when you've got a free moment.  I'm looking forward to hearing from you...

Thanks,   Alex
