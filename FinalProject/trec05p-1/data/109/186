system.  Contact Bob at 323-663-4831 to set up a time to meet.
 
Next week Bob will be in Calgary to attend the Ziff Energy Group
Conference and to demonstrate GPCM to various Canadian energy companies.

 
During the next two weeks, support questions can be directed to Bob's
office at 323-663-4831 or his cell phone 323-821-9075 or by e-mail to

LNG Tanker Prevented from Entering Boston Harbor
 
Claiming that Coast Guard plans are too vague, the mayor of Boston 
has filed suit in a federal court to prevent a tanker full of 
millions of gallons of LNG from entering the city's the harbor. After 
the terrorist attacks on September 11th, the Coast Guard kept tankers 
from entering the port for over a month while formulating a safety 
plan with officials from federal to local levels. After a disaster 
plan was prepared, the Coast Guard re-opened the harbor to tankers 
carrying the highly flammable gas on October 16th. Boston's mayor 
contends that the plans are not specific enough and provide too 
little information on evacuation and protection procedures for nearby 
neighborhoods. He pointed out that the ships path would run close to 
a recreation area and a highly traveled bridge. However, his 
allegations were contradicted by Massachusetts acting governor who 
said that the Coast Guards plans were sufficient to ensure safety. 
The governor said that the Coast Guard had worked closely with the 
appropriate public safety officials to create a security plan to 
ensure the safe delivery of LNG and she was confident that the plans 
were adequate. During the peak winter season, LNG provides up to 35% 
of heating supplies in New England.

Arctic Pipeline Plans May be Delayed
Plummeting natural gas prices and bulging inventories may have zapped
the urgency once attached to the construction of pipelines from Alaska's
North Slope or Canada's Mackenzie Delta in the Northwest Territories. It
is believed that sustained natural gas prices of $3 per MMBtu is needed
to make the ventures viable. Supporters of the projects contend that
even though current prices are not sufficient to garner the necessary
investments, it will be 6-10 years before either pipeline is
operational, as it could take up to 4 years to obtain regulatory
approval. They point to declining production from wells in the US and
maturing Canadian resources as proof of the need to proceed with the
projects. Even though the consortium of companies planning to build the
$2 billion Mackenzie Delta pipeline settled with native tribes by giving
them 33% ownership, they have not proceeded with plans to build the
1,375 mile pipeline. The consortium, which consists of Imperial Oil,
Conoco, Shell Canada and Exxon Mobil, says a feasibility study is
necessary to make an informed decision. Companies backing the $15 - $17
billion Alaskan pipeline, which could follow the route of either the
Alaskan Highway or go under the Beaufort Sea to the Mackenzie Delta, say
they will need federal assistance for the project to be feasible.
Alaska's governor, a strong supporter, has already asked the Senate to
supply incentives. BP, Exxon Mobil and Phillips are the major companies
involved in the Alaskan plans.
