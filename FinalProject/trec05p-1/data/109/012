Carol worked for me at Treasury.  She is just terrific.  Do you have any thoughts on the CofC?  I would love to help her out.  Thanks.

Hi Linda!
 
How are you?  I'm sure the atmosphere is far from normal in DC.  When I heard the news about Senator Daschle's office, my heart just sank.  I am sure that had I stayed with his office I would have been exposed due to the proximity of my cubicle to the mail desk.  
 
On a lighter note (so to speak), I declined the legislative assistant position with the California Assemblymember.  I expected a pay cut, but the salary was far below what I could financially afford.  Anyway, I came across a Manager of Legislative and Political Affairs position with the US Chamber of Commerce, Los Angeles office.  The qualifications are two years of experience; degree preferred; knowledge of legislative/policy process; etc. I may submit my cover letter and resume to the HR Dept. (as stated).  I need your guidance/advice:
 
1)  I know the CoC tends to be Republican.  How do you think my resume will be received?  2)  What are your thoughts about the CoC?  I would like to talk with folks who are either there or are familiar with them.  
 
I'd appeciate your thoughts.  Stay healthy and safe!
 
carol
