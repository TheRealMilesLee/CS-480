ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================================

PREVIEW for March 3, 2002

======================================================

Dear Folks -

   I hope you have been allowing the story of One/Two Man to work its magic
on you. It is a most wonderful story.

   But what in the world - either the outer or inner world - does such a
story have to do with us? And those various animals who helped One/Two Man
in his task? Especially the snake?

   When we gather this week, as promised, I'll give you some ideas about
what this story means. What I'm mostly interested in is how we can use this
story and others like it - and there are many - for our own movement toward
freedom and love.

   I also want to connect this story to that primal Judeo-Christian story of
the exodus.

   I hope to see you this week as we continue our journey
   from bondage to freedom,
      from darkness to light,
         from death to life.

Much love,

Bill Kerley
