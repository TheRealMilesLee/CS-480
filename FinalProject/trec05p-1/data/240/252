i found you via the internet infidels discussion boards they referred me to those pictures of bush and the chimps here.
and that s the vibe i get everybody who knows the answer is looking at the thread going is the shitstorm worth it? which of us has to be gns cop this time? and the wrong replies are mounting.
bummer shaz has gone offline but susan is on so woohoo someone to talk to! oh and hi christine see how nice i am!
visited your library a few years back and found information on my ray family and shirey family people were very helpful and nice.
