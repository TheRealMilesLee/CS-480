DEAR FRIEND,

COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON, MY NAME IS MR AYODELE TAIWO.THE BRANCH 

MANAGER OF ALLSTATE TRUST BANK OF NIGERIA PLC LAGOS STATE BRANCH. I AM 

WRITING IN RESPECT OF A FOREIGN CUSTOMER OF MY BANK(MR.WAHAB 

DANIEL)WITH ACCOUNT NUMBER ATS1022002-109 WHO PERISHED WITH HIS FAMILY 

IN AN AUTO CRASH IN ABUJA EXPRESWAY,IN NIGERIA, ON THE 17TH OF AUGUST 

2000.

SINCE THE DEMISE OF MR DANIEL,I PERSONALLY HAVE WATCHED WITH KEEN 

INTEREST TO SEE THE NEXT OF KIN BUT ALL HAS PROVED ABORTIVE AS NO ONE 

HAS COME TO CLAIM HIS FUNDS OF USD6.23M,SIX MILLION,TWO HUNDRED AND 

THIRTY THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS]HAS BEEN WITH OUR BANK HERE FOR A 

VERY LONG TIME, WHICH HAS ACCUMULATED SOME INTEREST.

ON THIS NOTE I DECIDED TO SEEK FOR YOU, YOUR NAME SHALL BE USED AS THE 

NEXT OF KIN,AS NO ONE HAS COME UP TO PUT CLAIM AS THE NEXT OF KIN TO 

THIS FUNDS AND THE BANKING ETHICS HERE DOES NOT ALLOW SUCH MONEY TO 

STAY MORE THAN FOUR YEARS,BECUASE AFTER FOUR YEARS THE MONEY WILL BE 

CALLED BACK TO THE BANK TREASURY AS UNCLAIMED BILL..

I AM CONVINCED IN MY MIND THAT YOUR NAME COULD BE USED AS THE NEXT OF 

KIN TO THIS CLAIM.THE REQUEST OF THE FOREIGNER AS A NEXT OF KIN IN THIS 

BUSINESS IS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS A FOREIGNER 

AND A NIGERIAN CANNOT STAND AS THE NEXT OF KIN TO A FOREIGNER.

I HAVE AGREED TO SHARE THIS MONEY WITH YOU IN THE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING 

OF 70%/30%.YOU KEEP 30% WHILE I KEEP 70%,THEREAFTER I WILL VISIT YOUR 

COUNTRY, FOR DISBURSEMENT AS I AM ALMOST DUE FOR RETIREMENT.

THEREFORE TO ENDEAVOUR THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF THIS FUNDS TO YOUR 

ACCOUNT,YOU HAVE TO APPLY FIRST TO THE BANK AS THE NEXT OF KIN TO THE 

DESEASED INDICATING BY SENDING AN APPLICATION AND LOCATION WHERE THE 

MONEY WILL BE REMITTED.

I WILL NOT FAIL TO BRING TO YOUR NOTICE THAT THIS BUSINESS IS HITCH 

FREE AND THAT YOU SHOULD NOT ENTERTAIN ANY FEAR AS THE WHOLE REQUIRED 

ARRANGEMENT AS BEEN PERFECTED FOR THE TRANSFER.

THIS IS MY PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS(mrayodeletaiwo@yahoo.ca) DO NOT 

HESITATE TO REPLY ME THROUGH THIS EMAIL ADDRESS IF YOU ARE INTERESTED. 

KIND REGARDS. 

MR.AYODELE TAIWO
