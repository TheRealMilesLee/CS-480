Steve,  I would like to be included in the bi-weekly UAF meetings.  Also,  I would like to attend the PGAS user meeting.  I could share the information discussed at this meeting with Gas Logistics to form a better understanding of mechanics of PGAS.  Let me know if this would be a problem.  Any question please give me a call.    			j.  floyd
