Dear Jeffrey Dasovich,

Welcome to the new Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group (SVMG) website!

On Friday, October 26, 2001, M3iworks & SVMG proudly launched SVMG's new
website--designed to be the "go-to" site for SVMG member companies,
legislators representing Silicon Valley, and public and private sector
entities concerned about key Silicon Valley quality-of-life issues and what
employers and legislators are doing to address the critical challenges we
face.

With your unique ID we ensure:

*  Appropriate access to sensitive site information.

* Personalized view of events, committee information, and other restricted
information--based on roles-based security design. 

* Online registration for events--register, see who else is attending, refer
a colleague, get directions, and more... 

*  Confirmation of event registration and wait-list processing.

* Self-maintenance of user records--update your own individual user
information.

Here is your personal login information:
