Dear Friend,

Please accept my apology for contacting you this way which was due to
the urgency of my request I am rather in a very precarious situation
that warrants my talking very little till I confirm our buisness
relationship.

If it is money please that would be no problem, I just need to know you
have the capacity to handle large funds and you can be trusted.

Presently I am in the tight clutches of my native government who has
amongst other things clamped my company and my freedom all in abid to
finance its reform programmes.

The internet for now is my only uncensored link to the outside world 
and
I would appreciate it if you take me very seriously.You would be well
renumerated for your effort and assistance.Hoping to hear soonest from 
you.

Regards,
MARK  STEVEN
