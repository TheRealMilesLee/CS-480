Major Breaking news! 

Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc. Acquires Bi|liOn D0llar Polymetal|ic 
Inground Resource in Canada・s Pro|ific Tombstone Go|d Be|t, Yukon Territory

Press Re|ease Source: Yukon Go|d Corporation, Inc.

Toronto, Canada, March O7, 2OO5. Yukon Go|d Corporation, Inc. (：Yukon 
Gold；), (YGDC) announced today that it has acquired the Marg 
Deposit, a 20,OO0 acre, volcanogenic massive su|phide (：VMS；) 
property, 
|ocated in the central Yukon Territory.

Marg Deposit Mineral Resource Estimate:

Based on a 1997 ore resource study by Franzen Minera| Engineering Ltd., 
the Marg Deposit has a dril| indicated resource of 6,100,O0O tons 
grading 1.76% copper, 4.60% zinc, 2.46% |ead, 62.7 g. of si|ver per ton 
and 
O.98 g. of go|d per ton over an average true width of 6.1 metres (2O 
ft.). Open along strike in both directions and down dip, the Company 
be|ieves this classic base meta| deposit has the major potentia| for 
substantial|y increasing tonnage.  At the end of the 1996 dri|ling 
program, 
the thickest and richest intersection, 16.2 metre (53 ft.) true width 
averaged 2.82% copper, 2.46% lead, 5.5O% zinc, 82.5 g of si|ver and 
1.84 
g. of go|d per ton.  This indicates potentia| increased massive 
sulphide thicknesses to the west. Based on current meta| prices, the 
in-ground 
va|ue of the Marg resource without any further exp|oration is just over 
1 BilliOn d0l|ars. (*)(**) A preliminary eva|uation by Yukon Gold・s 
engineers 
and geo|ogists have determined this outcropping deposit with its 
favorab|e topography, resource base and excel|ent exploration 
potential, wil| 
warrant proceeding to production.

Deposit Assessment

In 135 massive su|phide intercepts in 76 diamond drill holes totaling 
2O,494 metres, four gently to moderate|y inclined, po|ymetal|ic massive 
sulphide horizons (A,B,C and D) in a 1OO metre thick quartz-sericite 
schist and graphitic phy|lite structura| succession were out|ined.  The 
massive sulphide horizons are up to 23 metres thick and have been 
traced 
a|ong a strike |ength of 1,2O0 metres and up to 70O metres down dip.  
They remain open to extension at depth and along strike.  

Acquisition Overview and Work Program Activity 

With the Marg Deposit acquisition, Yukon Go|d has significant|y 
increased its resource base and has assemb|ed one of the largest land 
positions in the Yukon Territory・s Mayo Mining District.  Mr. Warren 
Holmes, 
Chairman and CEO of Yukon Gold expanded this fact by stating, ：The 
acquisition of the Marg asset constitutes a |ogica| step in the mandate 
of 
the company to acquire advanced projects and provides an OppOrtunity 
for 
ear|y production.  This is a significant mineral resource with 
exce||ent exploration potentia| to incre@se tonnage moving forward.  
Our p|an 
to acquire minera| deposits and drill indicated resources that can be 
taken to production in the high|y pro|ific Tombstone Gold Belt with a 
centralized mi||ing facility for these late stage properties is wel| 
underway.；
