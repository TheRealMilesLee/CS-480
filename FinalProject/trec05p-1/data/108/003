Kevin - I just realized I hadn't thanked you for your help in getting the hourly scalars done for power that I required for the proper valuation of my Real Option products.  They are all done. Thanks!

By the way, you had mentioned in your email that they may have some applications for EWS.  Is anyone using them up there?  

Thanks again and happy trading!

Beth
