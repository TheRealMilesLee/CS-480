I figured it out.  We can get in through the Internet directly.  Not through Trade Agent.  I will let everyone else know for future use.

We continue to have problems accessing the EastPower Website.  The site worked for the first time last Thursday, but now, it seems to be again unaccessable.  We have made several requests to Rika, but never seem to receive a response.  Any assistance you can provide would be appreciated.

thanks
