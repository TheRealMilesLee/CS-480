Sorry for the late reply...you may already have your answer...

PacifiCorp Power Marketing, Inc.  This is the entity they use for Physical.  I do not see that they trade any Finanical Power.  They have done Nat. Gas financial Swaps with ECC.

Is the legal entity for PacificCorp:	PacificCorp Power Marketing, Inc.?  Is there only an entity for financial power?  

Thanks.  Sara

Kim:

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

Thanks.
