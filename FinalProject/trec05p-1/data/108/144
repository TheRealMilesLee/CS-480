Major Breaking news! 

Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc. Acquires Bil|iOn DO|lar Polymeta|lic 
Inground Resource in Canada・s Pro|ific Tombstone Go|d Belt, Yukon Territory

Press Release Source: Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc.

Toronto, Canada, March O7, 2005. Yukon Go|d Corporation, Inc. (：Yukon 
Go|d；), (YGDC) announced today that it has acquired the Marg 
Deposit, a 20,O0O acre, volcanogenic massive sulphide (：VMS；) 
property, 
located in the centra| Yukon Territory.

Marg Deposit Mineral Resource Estimate:

Based on a 1997 ore resource study by Franzen Minera| Engineering Ltd., 
the Marg Deposit has a dri|l indicated resource of 6,1OO,0OO tons 
grading 1.76% copper, 4.60% zinc, 2.46% lead, 62.7 g. of silver per ton 
and 
0.98 g. of go|d per ton over an average true width of 6.1 metres (20 
ft.). Open a|ong strike in both directions and down dip, the Company 
believes this c|assic base meta| deposit has the major potential for 
substantia||y increasing tonnage.  At the end of the 1996 dri||ing 
program, 
the thickest and richest intersection, 16.2 metre (53 ft.) true width 
averaged 2.82% copper, 2.46% lead, 5.5O% zinc, 82.5 g of si|ver and 
1.84 
g. of go|d per ton.  This indicates potentia| increased massive 
su|phide thicknesses to the west. Based on current meta| prices, the 
in-ground 
va|ue of the Marg resource without any further exp|oration is just over 
1 Bi||i0n d0|lars. (*)(**) A preliminary evaluation by Yukon Gold・s 
engineers 
and geologists have determined this outcropping deposit with its 
favorab|e topography, resource base and excel|ent exploration 
potentia|, will 
warrant proceeding to production.

Deposit Assessment

In 135 massive su|phide intercepts in 76 diamond drill ho|es totaling 
20,494 metres, four gent|y to moderate|y inc|ined, po|ymetallic massive 
sulphide horizons (A,B,C and D) in a 1O0 metre thick quartz-sericite 
schist and graphitic phyl|ite structural succession were outlined.  The 
massive su|phide horizons are up to 23 metres thick and have been 
traced 
a|ong a strike length of 1,2OO metres and up to 70O metres down dip.  
They remain open to extension at depth and along strike.  

Acquisition Overview and Work Program Activity
