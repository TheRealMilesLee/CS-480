Gentlemen,
 
As a follow-up to the question regarding the reliability of DOE vs API numbers:
 
According to our contacts at the API, API checks the relability of their numbers against the DOE.  Specifically with their import numbers, API claims that their import assessment captures 95% of all imports.  The imports they use as their benchmark for this statistic are the DOEs.
 
Matt Anderson will be working on an analysis today.
 
Jeff
