KIND ATTENTION FOR URGENT BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL.

Dear Friend, 
 
Compliment of the day and how is life general with you? Of course it is my
humble wish to solicit and crave your indulgence to make this project request
for a joint business transaction which I hope will not come to you as a surprise,
hence I plead for yourpardon.
I am Dr.Henry King,the Auditing and Accouunit,Foreign Operations Department
Union Bank Of Nig, PLC. I have an urgent and confidential business proposal
for you.On June 6, 1999, an Australlconsultant/contractor with via National
Petroleumcooperation (NNPC) LaEngr. Steve Moore made a umbered time (fixed)
deposit for twelve calenderer month valued atUS$15.500.000(Fiften Million
Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) inbranch.On maturity, I sent a routine
notification thisforwarded address but got no reply after months we sendreminder
and finally we discovered from his contract employee (Nigeria national petroleum
Corporation) that Late Engr.Steve Moore died from an automobile accident.
On further investigation, it was clear that he died without making a will.
All attempts by the Australian to trace his next of kin were fruitless.
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Late Engr. Steve
Moore did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents
including his deposit document in my bank. The total sum of US$15,500,000.00
is still in my bank as dormant acct. 
No one will ever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian banking law,
after five years,the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government.
If the account owner is certified death and nobody comes forward to claim
it.
This is the situation , and my proposal is that I am looking for a foreigner
who will stand in as the beneficiary/next of kin. This is simple. All you
have to do is to immediately send me the details of a bank account anywhere
in the world for me to arrange the proper money transfer document. The money
will then be transferred into the account for us to share in the rationof
60% for me 30% for you while the remaining 10% will be set aside for expenses
incurred within here and there.
There is no risk involved. I am using my position and connection in the bank
here to do all the document work for the transaction. We shall employ the
services of an attorney to draft the will and obtain all necessary documents
and letter of administration in your fovour for the transfer. This ransaction
is risk free guaranteed. If you are interested, please reply immediatelyconfidentiality
and be rest assured that this transaction could be most profitable for both
of us. 
Please do not expose this deal if you are not interested because if you do,
it will take me out of seat.
I am awaiting your urgent reply.

Best regards,
Dr.Henry King,
