Management

This important message will appear in the upcoming Operations Update.

MMC is committed to assisting the families of our colleagues through 
this most difficult time.  We want to make sure that they are aware of 
all the programs and services the Company is providing and that they 
fully understand the benefits to which they are entitled, as well as 
other benefits that may be available through outside agencies.  In 
reviewing the most effective way to continue serving the families 
affected by the September 11th disaster, we have made the decision to 
move to a family relationship management approach.  Our priority in 
moving forward is to ensure that we provide the families with the best 
one-on-one assistance and the best information possible.

Family Relationship Management
To that end, we have engaged Right Management Associates (Right) to 
work with us as our Family Relationship Managers.  Reginald McQuay, a 
Marsh Senior Vice President, will manage this program as the main 
interface between Marsh and Right,s counselors to guide this important 
process.  All of the Family Relationship Managers have substantial 
experience in Human Resources, and we feel they will represent us well 
as we help the families move forward.  Additionally, Right has worked 
with Marsh over the last several years and, therefore, knows our 
organization well.

We are already moving quickly to transition to this process.  The 
Family Relationship Managers have participated in detailed orientation 
and training sessions, acquainting themselves with MMC,s benefits, 
legal, communication and policy issues.  Each of the families will be 
contacted within the next week by the Family Relationship Managers  
representing Marsh; in this way the transition will be as transparent 
as possible to the families.  In addition, a letter will be sent to 
each family's primary contact this week, providing them with the name 
and phone number of their Relationship Manager.

One important point that you need to be aware of concerns the &primary 
contact8 for each family.  We have been working with the MMC Benefits 
and Legal Departments to determine whom the appropriate family contact 
for all matters should be as we move forward.  Please keep in mind that 
this individual may not always be the person with whom you have had 
contact.  We are trying to ensure that the detailed financial and 
benefit information is only provided to the family members who should 
have it. 

Additional Counseling
We will also be offering Survivor Support Financial Counseling to the 
primary contact through the Ayco Company.  Ayco counselors will provide 
detailed information on survivor benefits and will also be arranging to 
meet personally with each of the families.  This will follow issuance 
of the benefit summary statement, which is scheduled to be distributed 
during the week of October 15.  Ayco counselors will be coordinating 
their efforts with the Family Relationship Managers as well.

In addition, we have expanded the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for 
one year for the families.  This will provide access to counselors who 
are skilled in grief and trauma situations.

Your Role As A Manager
We recognize that in many instances Marsh managers have had long 
relationships with the various families.  Although it is important to 
maintain those contacts and continue to provide emotional support, it 
is equally important that you begin to transfer the responsibility for 
information dissemination and management to the Family Relationship 
Managers.  To this end, we are asking that you allow the Family 
Relationship Managers to facilitate the contact with all Marsh services 
and that you do not provide direct referrals to services, promise any 
additional services or become the intermediary in resolving the 
families, issues. 

Please keep us informed of your contact with any of the families since 
this information can be  helpful to Family Relationship Managers.  To 
help facilitate this, we have attached a call log to capture important 
information from both past conversations and any particulars that may 
arise in the future.  Please forward these logs to Reg McQuay at 1166 
Ave. of the Americas, 43rd floor (reginald.a.mcquay@marsh.com). 

This Family Relationship Management Program will provide the best 
possible support for our colleagues, families as they move forward 
during this difficult time.  If you have any further questions please 
call me or your HR manager, and help us by distributing this memo to 
other managers who need to know this information.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sally Bott
