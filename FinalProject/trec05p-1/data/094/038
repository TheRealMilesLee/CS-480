Another team wants to makeup a game this Oct 24th, at 6:30pm. This game
is optional and could take the place of practice on Thursday.  We'll
still have practice this Tuesday, Oct 23rd, and have a regularly
scheduled game this Saturday, Oct 27th, at 11am.

Pls respond and let me know if you'd like to have the Wed make-up game
(or not).
