VENTURE 
MARKET 
SUMMARY 

	It was an active day on the funding front with 20 companies reeling in $196 million. Biotech continues to be a hot sector, with Edinburgh, Scotland-based Ardana Bioscience, a reproductive health pharmaceutical company, raising GBP 13.3 million ($20 million) in its first round of funding led by Merlin Biosciences. 

Another European life sciences startup, Axxima Pharmaceuticals, a developer of proprietary small molecule compounds that block signal transduction pathways pathogens need to survive, said it received EUR 30.6 million ($27 million) in third-round funds led by new investor Bear Sterns Health Innoventures. The funding was the first Bear Sterns has made through its Health Innoventures unit.

Meanwhile, NexRay, a Los Gatos, Calif.-based developer of medical x-ray fluoroscopy systems, said it raised $21 million with most of the financing coming from new investors JPMorgan Partners, AIG Global, RiverVest Ventures, Wheatley Partners, and Greater Bay Bank. 

Also trying to take advantage of the biotech market is Senmed Medical Ventures, which operates the venture capital arm of Sentron Medical. The Cincinnati-based firm, which invests in mid-stage medical companies, is preparing to raise its first venture capital fund from outside investors, Skip Dederick, the firm's group director of venture projects, told VentureWire. Senmed, which now operates an evergreen fund, will begin talking to potential limited partners, targeting approximately $150 million. - By John Fuller <mailto:fuller@technologicp.com>

Chief Executive Officer
Slam Dunk Networks


A veteran of Silicon Valley, Bob Miller began his career at IBM, where as one of the youngest R&D lab directors in the company's history he led the creation of the first large-scale plasma panels -- the forerunner to the flat-screen television of today. While at IBM he was awarded six computer and systems architecture patents and was responsible for VTAM, a global networking solution. He left IBM to become COO for the computer systems business of Data General, where he headed the development of the DG-1, the first fully PC-compatible laptop, and the Comprehensive Electronic Office, an early networked office automation solution. Bob later served as CEO of MIPS Computers, where he led the development of the first 64-bit microprocessor. He also spearheaded the company's initial public offering and subsequent purchase by SGI (formerly Silicon Graphics). From MIPS, Bob went on to found NeTpower and served as its chairman and CEO. And, on November 6, at the Fairmont in! San Jose, he will share his perspectives with us on what it takes to continue growing your company on these trying times.

How to Get Ready Today to Get Bought Tomorrow

Mergers and acquisitions will pick up again, perhaps
before IPOs do, and few know more about preparing for
such an exit strategy than Ammar Hanafi, Matt L'Heureux,
Steve Smith, and Les Vadasz. Currently advising HP on
its $21 billion takeover of Compaq, Matt heads Goldman's
worldwide technology M&A. Steve built Broadview's
Silicon Valley business. Les, head of Intel Capital,
and Ammar, his counterpart at Cisco, run two of the
world's most extensive corporate development and
acquisition programs. You'd be hard-pressed to find four
more qualified to tell you how to find the right
corporate partner and make the relationship work. For
straight talk from the voices of authority, register

A funny thing happened on the way to the market

The resources necessary to conduct clinical trials
require an enormous investment and small road bumps
in the drug approval process can kill a promising drug.
For many start-ups, one strike means you're out.  New
technologies and business models, however, promise to
dramatically change trial management.  This year's
Healthcare Outlook will look at the impact of clinical
trials on emerging companies as well as the investment
opportunities available in companies that look to change
the status quo. Healthcare Outlook's Private Equity
Platform has dedicated a special track that will feature
management presentations by early-stage companies looking
to improve the clinical trial process.  In addition, the
meeting will feature an industry roundtable, From the
Pipeline Through Clinical Trials, moderated by Sam
Collela, Managing Director of Versant Ventures.
