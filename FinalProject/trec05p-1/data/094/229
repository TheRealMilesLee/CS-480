How are you this morning?
Are you listening to the investor conference call?
Are you going to the employee meeting?

You need to let me know when you have regular scheduled meetings so i'm not calling at those times.
When does nymex open and close?

I could tell you were in a meeting when i called this morning. It also sounded like you are sick. Are you???

Not too much going on up here, just the usual pissed off customers yelling at me!

Hope all is well.

Mike
