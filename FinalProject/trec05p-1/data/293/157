FROM MR ANDY BELLO
THE AUDITOR/ ACCOUNTANT GENERAL.
OF INTERCONTINENTAL
BANK COTONOU BENIN REPUBLIC
WEST AFRICA.
TEL:+229 457965
 
Dear Friend,
 
I am Andy Bello, the personal accountant to Mr.
Ramesh J Singh, who used to work with Oil
consultant/contractor with the Benenoise Solid
Minerals Corporation in Cotonou, Benin Republic.
 
On the 25th December 2003, my client, his wife and
their two children were involved in an Air
Crash,who unfortunately died in the plane crash of
Union Transport Africaines Flight Boeing 727 in
Cotonou, Benin Republic on the december 25,2003,
when going hollidays to Lebanon.
 
You will read more stories about the crash on
visiting this website:

www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/ story.html

www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/
 
All occupants of the all unfortunately lost their
lives. Since then I have made several enquiries if
I can locate any of my clients extended relatives
this has also proved unsuccessful. After these
several unsuccessful attempts, to locate any
member of his family hence I contacted you.
 
I Further investigations,and all attempts to trace
his next of kin was fruitless.Again,I made further
investigation and discovered that Mr.Ramesh
J.Singh did not declare any next of kin or
relations in all his official documents, including
his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.
 
This sum of US$7,500,000.00 is still sitting in my
Bank No one will ever come forward to claim it.
According to the International Banking
ethics,codes and Laws, at the expiration of 2(Two)
years, the money will revert to the ownership of
the Benin Government if nobody applies to claim
the fund.
 
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you
as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to
Mr.Ramesh J.Singh This is simple, I will like you
to respond immediately with your full names and
address so that we will prepare the necessary
documents and affidavits that will put you in
place as the next of kin. A bank account in any
part of the world that you will provide will then
facilitate the transfer of this money to you as
the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be
paid into your account for us to share in the
ratio of 60% for me and  35% for you and 5% for
Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction
.

All I require is your honest co-operation to
enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that
this will be executed under a legitimate
arrangement that will protect you from any breach
of the law. All documents of transaction will be
destroyed immediately we receive this money
leaving no trace to any place.Get back to me
through my private email box:andy_bello57@hotmail.com 

 
If this Offer is acceptable to you, kindly send
your following information stated blow:
 
a. Your full name and Address
b. Private telephone number
c. Private fax numbers
d. Private email
 
I look forward to see your urgent respones.

Have a nice day.

Remain Bless,

Mr. Andy Bello
