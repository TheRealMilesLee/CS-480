DR PRETTY ASARA
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT
CREDIT BANK BENIN
COTONOU-BENIN REPUBLIC
WEST AFRICA.
TEL/ 229-98-63-69

My Dear Friend,

I am DR.PRETTY ASARA,the director in charge of auditing and accounting =
section of Credit Bank Benin republic in West Africa with due respect a=
nd regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that=
 will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction.

During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came =
across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died=
 on 30th january 2000 on Kenya Airways with aircraft Airbus 310-304 at =
location Abidjan, Ivory Coast, with registration number 5Y-BEN while tr=
avelling with his entire family, his wife, two children and a maid on a=
 festive visit to Abidjan and since his untimely death the funds has be=
en dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund =
in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery =
to this development.

Although personally, I kept this information secret within myself and p=
artners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful=
 during the time of execution. The said amount was USD$24.1M (twenty fo=
ur Million one Hundred Thousand united states dollars).

As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information throu=
gh my good friend who works with chamber of commerce on foreign busines=
s relations here in Cotonou-Benin, it is him who recommended your perso=
n to me to be viable and capable to champion a business of such magnitu=
de without any problem.

Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the =
bonafide next of kin to the deceased and get the required approval and =
transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place, all dir=
ectives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you in=
dicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit your=
self to this great business opportunity.

In fact i could have done this deal alone but because of my position in=
 this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to operate a forei=
gn account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the=
 time of transfer because i work in this bank.=20

This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow =
who will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present=
 a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred in=
to on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification=
 by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be =
remitted from to your own designated bank account.

May i at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free a=
s i have made all arrangements for a successful transaction as an insid=
er of the bank before contacting you.

On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% o=
f the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take c=
are of any expenses that may arise during the time of transfer like tel=
ephone bills, fax and our travel tickets to come over to your country f=
or the sharing of the fund while 60% will be for me and my partners.

Please you have been advised to keep this a top secret as we are still =
in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this dea=
l with you.

I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you co=
nfirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country=
 for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously=
 indicated and further investment either in your country or any country=
 you will advice us to invest in.

All other necessary information will be sent to you on your acceptance =
to champion this transaction with me.=20

I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible or you contact me on m=
y private line  229 98 63 69 stating your wish in this deal.

Yours Faithfully,

DR.PRETTY ASARA
