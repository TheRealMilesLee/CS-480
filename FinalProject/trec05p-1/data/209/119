Louise,

In the Governance email which you sent, Mike Bridges was identified as a member of the Operational Restart Sub-Committee. I assume you meant Mark Bridges.

I suspect this might have lead to Mike receiving a phonecall today from UBS asking him for information.

An excited Mike called me to ask if he is invited to join UBS. I told him that I thought it was a mistake, but that I would confirm it with you.

Dave
