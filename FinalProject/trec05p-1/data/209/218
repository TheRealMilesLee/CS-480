Here's the file showing which brokers owe us cash as of close of business 1/24/02.  Look at the "0124" tab and under the "Wire Day Cash In/Out" column.  The $95.6MM represents the amount each of these brokers owes to us (We owe HSBC $2,132).  Also, I sent figures to Steve Van Hooser and Mark Taylor on 12/5/01 for the exchange amounts that were due as of 11/30 and 12/4 for $58.4MM and $87.3MM respectively.  Currently all of our exchange positions are closed.


 

Thanks,
Todd
