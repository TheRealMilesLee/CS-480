HOUSTON (Reuters) - Former Enron Corp. vice chairman J. Clifford Baxter 
committed suicide on Friday, found with a gunshot wound to his head, Texas 
police said. 

Sugar Land police department spokeswoman Patricia Whitty said Baxter was 
found inside his car early on Friday with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to 
his head, and a suicide note at his side. There were no apparent signs of 
foul play, she said. 

Enron confirmed the death in a statement. 

"We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our friend and colleague, Cliff 
Baxter," the Enron statement said. 

Baxter was vice chairman of the collapsed energy trader when he resigned in 
May 2001. He lived in Sugar Land, a suburb on Houston's southwest border.
