Hi Therese, I need to take 4 days off next week, monday through thursday.  Please use my discretionary day, personal day and vacation time for that purpose.

Also, would you please mail my paystub from next Thursday's ?  My last paystub (Jan 15) is not in the mail box, I think I asked Shirley to keep it.  If she has it , pelase mail both of them as I won't be in the office on Thrusday.
