Dear Ms Bastida:
 
    I'm not certain where to direct  this request, so, if contract admin is not the right group, I hope you will  call me or route this request to appropriate group ASAP.
 
    I have some clients (munis in  Southern California) who are interested in tradeable rights on SoCal's system  and possibly obtaining their own transport on TWPL.  
 
    I have an old (1991)  Transwestern system map, and I would like to get an up to date set of  system maps (system & laterals, compressors, delivery points, etc) at your  earliest.
 
    Please do not hesitate to call  me should you wish to discuss this or if there is a charge.
My mailing address & phone (for charges for the  maps or questions) are as follows:
 
Best regards,
