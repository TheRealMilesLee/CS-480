Dear friend,

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I belie=
ve
everyone ill die someday. My name is Mr. Marcus Caru a merchant from Norw=
ay.
I have been diagnosed with Oesophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms o=
f
medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live,
according to medical experts.

I have not particularly lived a good life, as I never really cared for an=
yone
(not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never gen=
erous,
I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that wa=
s
the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that
there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in
the world.

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would=

live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has c=
alled
me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediat=
e
and extended family members as well as a few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to
give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charit=
y
organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.

I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distrib=
ute
the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Paki=
stan;
they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them=

anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.=


The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of se=
venteen
million dollars ($17,000,000.00) that I have with a Trust company abroad.=

I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to char=
ity
organizations. I have set aside 20% for you and for your time.

God be with you.

Marcus Caru
