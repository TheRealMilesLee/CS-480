Mark,
I am ok with the suggested changes but the news Gary gave us this morning will make this assignment very difficult to complete.
Regards,
Brent

Mark

My NY colleagues have asked me to put somefurther suggestions to you on the
agreement.  Could you please let me have your feedback.

The reason for the changes are:

1.   Because we are talking to you on a range of things, we do not want
this non disclosure agreement to taint any other negotiaon process;

2.   If we conclude a deal, presumably we will have something in htere
about confidentiality so that should be left to htat agreement.

My mark up is based on the last one you snet me which is the final one you
sent for execution I think


Regards

Paul Rogerson
