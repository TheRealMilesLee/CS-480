Petroleum Argus has in-depth information for you on refinery maintenance!

Petroleum Argus' Refinery Turnarounds service offers the latest information on scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, detailing the unit size and duration of the turnaround - for both domestic and international plants. We also analyze the impact of shutdowns on crude and product prices. 

How do we get this information?

Petroleum Argus has scores of reporters all over the globe - so we get the inside track on these turnarounds well before they are announced. We talk not only to the plant managers, but also to traders and oil company inside sources.

Petroleum Argus publishes a variety of petroleum industry publications - from the industry standards Weekly Petroleum Argus and Argus Global Markets to Argus LatAm Energy, Argus Crude and Argus Asphalt Report - giving us a thorough understanding of the industry and reliable contacts cultivated from having over 30 years of petroleum industry experience.

If you produce crude or market products: These turnarounds directly affect your margins - you need to know when they occur in order to accurately assess your best supply and demand strategies. 
If you service the industry: This information is vital, giving you the inside track to equipment and service opportunities well before the competition learns of them. 
If you analyze market trends or forecast prices: You must have accurate maintenance data if your forecasts and analysis are to be accurate.
