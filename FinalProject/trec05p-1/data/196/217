Hello Hunter,

Hope things are going well on your end (as well as they can be for all of us, I guess :-).  I was recently asked by Louise to return to EnronOnline from Power to help out with the re-launch under the new umbrella.  One of the things on which I'm working with Dave Forster, is to collate the various launch plans for EnronOnline, as well as the Gas and Power groups.  To that end, I would really appreciate your sparing a few minutes and meeting with me (at your earliest convenience) to chat about the plans I've seen for the Gas Desk. The intent is to polish all the plans and present them to UBS as the sale is completed.  Some of the detailed questions that came about (and re. which I'd need your help) were things like:

What will it take for us to start offering physical products on EOL?
How long would it take to obtain the appropriate permits, etc?
What documentation is required to support the application process?
Who is responsible to get these permits and coordinate this process?
Etc.

I recognize that some of these questions may not pertain to your group, and also that different desks will potentially have different requirements, but I'd really appreciate your pointing me in the right direction at least.

Thanks in advance,
Rahil
