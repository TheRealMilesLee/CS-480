ATTN: PRESIDENT/C.E.O

I am pleased to get across to you for a very urgent and profitable
business proposal, though I don't know you neither have I seen you before

State chamber of Commerce and Industry handed me yourcontact for a
confidential business. I am the manager of United Bank for Africa
Plc(UBA),Ilupeju branch, Lagos Nigeria.The intended business is thus; We
had a  customer, a Foreign resident in Nigeria, he was a Contractor with
one of the Government Parastatals.He has in his Account in my branch the
sum of US 15.5 Million (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U.S
Dollars).Unfortunately, the man died three  years ago until today non-of
his next of kin has come forward to claim the money.

Having noticed this, I in collaboration with two other top Officials of
the bank have covered up the account all this while.  Now we want you
(being a foreigner) to be fronted as one of his next of kin and forward
your account and other relevant documents to be advised to you by us to
attest to the Claim. We will use our positions to get all internal
documentations to back up the claims . The whole procedures will last only
five working days to get the fund retrieved successfully without trace

we have arranged all necessary things.

As soon as this message comes to you kindly get back to me indicating
your interest, then I will furnish you with the whole procedures to
ensure that the deal is successfully concluded. For your assistance we
have agreed to give you twenty five percent (25%) of the Total sum at the
end of the transaction while 65% would be for my colleagues and I and the
remaining 10% would be for any form ofexpenses that may be incurred
during the course of the transaction which would be given to us when the
money is transferred into your account before splitting the balance on
the agreed percentage of 65% to 25%. In order to get  all the legal
documents from the court, kindly send the following information to us
immediately.
