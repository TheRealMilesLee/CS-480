Dear ESWG,

This is to notify you that Bob Harshbarger is going to be the new chair of the Electronic Scheduling Working Group.  Bob is taking over as I have accepted a new position with another company.  I have also had a change in plans for this week and will not be able to attend the ESWG meeting set for Thursday (1-5pm).  Bob will handle this meeting as well.

Bob's contact information is:

(425) 462-3348
bharsh@puget.com 


Thanks to all of you for your help as this group has started and I'm sure I'll see you around in the future.

- Jerry
