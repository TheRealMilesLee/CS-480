Hello,

I wanted to inform you that I have launched my new website,  where I can tell you a little bit about how I brought beauty back into my hair.

Harsh chemicals, swimming, and exposure to the sun left my hair dry, damaged, and destroyed. I felt the need for a product to restore its brilliance, but could not find anything on the market that was both natural and effective.
During my young adulthood, I traveled as a swim athlete throughout Europe and gathered natural beauty remedies. I combined these pure ingredients and developed a unique formulation that became what we know today as Nana Essence.

I wanted to share my products with others so that they could too benefit from the natural remedies found in Nana Essence. Now I want you to try my products... you will not regret it!

Thank you for taking the time to read my letter; I appreciate your
business.
