If you go out to http://enron.ccsystems.com you can change your profile.  You need to change your room number to reflect your location on 40.

4082	Eric
4084	Steve
4085	Kevin

And you also need to change your mail stop to 4055.  This is the closest mail stop to us.

Sorry, but I don't have access to do this for you.  You will also need to change it on your HR location.  For some reason these two systems don't talk to each other.

Thanks!
