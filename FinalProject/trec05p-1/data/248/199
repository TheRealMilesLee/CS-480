I was merely poking fun at those who are complaining about the size of the deer herd on our place.  I certainly don't have any complaints, especially if I get a shot at an exotic or two.

			I agree, we started out with 3, went to 1, no we are going in the wrong direction again.  By the way, wasn't Mertz supposed to add more acreage to this ranch?  I think we have hunted everything we can on ol' Autry.

				Wait a minute, lets think about this.  We already have one attorney on the lease, can we handle another??     We're gonna need a bigger ranch!

					Think this a great idea...he is just the ideal person to have on the lease
					and as standup and nice of a guy you would ever want to know. I'd give him a
					bid right away!!!

					Deer All:
					
					I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to
					
					fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).
					
					B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head
					of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they
					were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and
					doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
					Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot.
					His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking
					for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out
					there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and
					would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.
					
					He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I
					don't care about that.
					
					Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could
					proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up
					taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two
					
					spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this
					
					spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be
					the fall back plan.
					
					Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.
					
					
					Erik.
