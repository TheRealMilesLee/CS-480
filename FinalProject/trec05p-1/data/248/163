   Word of the Day for Tuesday March 12, 2002:

   desideratum \dih-sid-uh-RAY-tum; -RAH-\, noun;
   plural desiderata:
   Something desired or considered necessary.

     No  one in Berkeley -- at least, no one I consorted with --
     thought  art was for sissies, or that a pensionable job was
     the highest desideratum.
     --John  Banville,  "Just  a dream some of us had," [1]Irish
     Times, August 24, 1998

     Immense  wealth, and its lavish expenditure, fill the great
     house with all that can please the eye, or tempt the taste.
     Here, appetite, not food, is the great desideratum.
     --Frederick Douglass, [2]My Bondage, My Freedom

     A  technical  dictionary ... is one of the desiderata in
     anatomy.
     --Alexander Monro, Essay on Comparative Anatomy
     _________________________________________________________

   Desideratum is from Latin desideratum, "a thing desired," from
   desiderare, "to desire."
