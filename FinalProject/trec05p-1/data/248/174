Dearest,

I have a proposal for you- this however is not mandatory nor will I in any ma=
nner compel you to honour against your will.=20

The situation i am presently facing has prompted me to contact you regarding =
this urgent request of mine. Actually, I am miss Ann Obih the only daughter o=
f my late parents Mr. and Mrs. Obih.

My father was a highly reputable business tycoon-(in the sales of cocoa and c=
ocoa plantation) who operated in the capital of cote d'ivoire during his days=
=2E

It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously, as he was piosoned during =
one of his business trips early last year. Though his sudden death was linked=
 or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who went al=
ong at that time.=20

My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and since then my father took me =
so special. Prior to the time of his death he told me that he has the sum of =
eight million, seven hundred thousand United State Dollars.(USD$8.700,000) le=
ft in one of the leading finance/security company here=20
in Abidjan, Ivory coast West Africa.=20

He further told me that he deposited the money in a consignment(box), coded i=
t to the security company as african artifacts, so the security company is no=
t aware that the content of the consignment. He did this for the safety of th=
e money.

I am just 18 years old and a high school undergraduate and really don't know =
what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of=
 incessant political crisis here in Cote d'ivoire. The death of my father act=
ually brought sorrow to my life. I am in a sincere=20
desire of your humble assistance in this regards. Your suggestions and ideas =
will be highly regarded.

Now permit me to ask these few questions:-=20

1. Can you honestly help me as a guardian?=20

2. What proof can you give that i can i completely trust you?=20

3. What can i offer you from the total amount in the consignment as a percent=
age for your assistance in retrieving this consignment from the security comp=
any?=20

Please, consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.=20

Thank you so much.

My sincere regards,

Ann Obih
