Breaking News!

Triton American Energy Corp. (TRAE) is pleased to announce after one full year of operations, financial audits are now underway. Audits are anticipated to be completed by August 1st and will reflect fiscal year 2004 to 2005 results.

Once audits are completed, Triton American Energy will file to move to a new, more liquid exchange and begin presenting their company to stockbrokers through out the country. 

President and CEO, Louis Guidry states "We are now entering the stage where our acquisitions are driving in immediate residual revenues for our company. With the completion of our audits, investors will have the 0pp0rtunity to watch our growth on a quarter to quarter and year over year basis." Mr. Guidry continued to state "We value our shareholders and look forward to opening our books and allowing investors to experience the true meaning of residual revenue and income growth of a proven energy company." 

Triton American Energy Corp. (TRAE) of Houston, TX., is pleased to announce they are now producing approximately 850,000 cubic feet of gas per day from 2 wells within the Dyersdale North Field. These wells have a life expectancy of 10 years. Currently, Triton American Energy owns 8 wells within these fields. These wells hold estimated reserves of 3 billion cubic feet of gas and 345,000 barrels of oil. Triton American Energy also owns wells within Zapata County which have proven reserves and are pulling in 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas per day. 

This current production and strong forecast comes on the heels of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) projecting gas prices to remain at record levels through 2006. Triton American Energy anticipates high gas prices will fuel the companies continued month over month and year over year record revenue growth. According to the EIA "the primary factor behind the price increases is crude oil costs. High world oil demand will continue to support crude oil prices and increasee competition for gasoline imports". Triton American Energy and its investors benefit from the rising oil and gas prices. 

President and CEO, Louis Guidry stated "We are very excited about the direction of where our company is headed. In the last 10 months we have acquired over 28 oil and gas wells which have proven reserves. As oil prices continue to fuel the rise of gas prices, we will seek to take full advantage of our gas wells within Zapata County and the Dyersdale North Field." Mr. Guidry continued to state, "Our goal is to have all 28 gas and oil wells online in less then one year, while acquiring additional abandon wells. We are also very confident in achieving the status of being a multi-million dollar company with strong profit margins by the second quarter of 2006. We are well on our way to reaching this milestone and will be preparing audited financials for our investors this summer".
