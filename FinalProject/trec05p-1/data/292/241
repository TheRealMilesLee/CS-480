Hello, 
 
My boyfriend began having problems with erections (he's older) 
and I suggested he look into VlAGRRA Softtabs.
 
    Boy, am I glad he did!
 
The first time he tried it, one 50 mg piIl did nothing so he took another and that was a mistake. Three hours later he was still rock hard and had come multiple times (so had I)!! Since then a single 50 mg dose does iThe first of these was that he should have been brought to trial att very well--he's now good for almost 2 hours of good hard sex that leaves both of us worn out.
