Attn: Sir, 

I hope this e-mail wouldn't come to you as a surprise.Having gone through=


your profile, I am convinced and pleased to solicit your sincere and urge=
nt

assistance over this matter. I am Barrister Ethel Nwajohn, an Attorney to=

Late 
Mr.Lunceford, local contractor with the Lagos State Government of Nigeria=
.
My 
client Late was awarded a contract worth of Twenty-Five Million United St=
ates

Dollars (25,000,000:00USD) by the Lagos state Government of Nigeria for

the maintenance and construction of roads in the states in 1999 and the

contract was fully executed by my late client. 

My client has been paid Fifteen Million United States Dollars from the co=
ntract
and he was to receive the balance payment of the contract, but unfortunat=
ely
my client was involved in a fatal auto accident with his entire family on=

Sagamu Express Road where he eventually lost his life and his two kids an=
d
wife. This was in 25th of December of 2001. Sequel to the death of my cli=
ent,
there is every need to present a next of kin to Lagos State Government so=

that they can release the balance of his contract money. Already the CONT=
RACT
PAYMENT OFFICE under the Lagos State Government has contacted me that the=

balance payment for the executed contract, which has been approved for pa=
yment,
is ready for collection. I am therefore asked to present the beneficiary/=
next
of kin for the claim of the money (draft) from their office. At this junc=
ture,
I have decided to divert this Ten Million United States Dollars to a fore=
igner
who will be presented to LSG, by soliciting the assistance of a reliable
individual (A Foreigner) that will be presented as the beneficiary/next
of kin of the fund. 

I will prepare all legal documents in your name as the successor /next of=


kin from our Federal High Court to back up the claim on your behalf which=


will enable Lagos State Government to release the money to me on your beh=
alf

as the known next of kin to my late client. As soon as I hear your positi=
ve

response; action will commence. Please bear in mind that there is no risk=


involved in this transaction, but it requires absolute sincerity and conf=
identiality
due to the nature of the transaction. I am willing to give you 40% of the=

fund as a reward for your assistance in this transaction and all the expe=
nses
made in the process of this claim would be reimbursed before sharing. 

I will want you to respond to my email above or through this email: (etnw=
ajon@ny.com)
with your contact address and private phone number 
for easy communication. 

I look forward to your swift response. 

Regards, 
Ethel Nwajohn 
Principal Attorney
