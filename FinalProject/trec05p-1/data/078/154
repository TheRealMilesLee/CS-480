Attached are the spreadsheets for September and October.  There is a measurement issue on 9/27.  Finalized TW measurement at the Interconnect shows 39455 Mmbtus, whereas SCADA from Gas Control at the inlet to the plant shows a volume of 58411 Mmbtus, therefore creating a difference of 19949 between the interconnect and the inlet to the plant.  Craig, I don't know if you have a more accurate number or if we just want to go with the 39455 measured volume since I believe it to be the most accurate volume.

Please respond with your feedback on this issue.

 
 
Thank you!
Amy Mulligan
