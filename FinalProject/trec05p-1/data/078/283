Veroinca,

Below is some additional information regarding our conversation yesterday on MMS. There are 3 deals in Sitara that capture the deal that Nelson has done that begins November and runs through March (Deal #1103008, 1103884, 1103914). We are working with Gerald Nemec to establish a GISB to cover this deal. We are going to use the same form that was used by Enron North America. 

Please let me know if there is anything else that you need from me.

Judy

Nelson, your current GISB is dated 1/1/2001 and is between Enron North
America Corp. and MMS.

When we scored the 2000 financials we used Enron Corp. financial statements.
We can certainly use other Enron subsidiary's financials if you want to
provide them but, if Enron North America Upstream Company LLC is the
purchaser and the only financial statements we have are Enron Corp. we would
like the parental guarantee to be from Enron Corp.


Enclosed is a guarantee that is available on our web page. You can provide
your own if that is more convenient. At a minimum, the guarantee should
cover 60 days volume at current prices and the term should go from the first
delivery date under the contract until  60 days beyond the last delivery
date. In some cases, we have had companies increase the term and value of
the guarantee so that adjustments don't have to be made for subsequent
purchases.

I know that this is additional paperwork. We are trying to streamline things
as much as we can. But, one of the things we have to deal with is making
sure we are consistent with all our purchasers. We appreciate your continued
interest in the MMS RIK program. Let me know if you have any questions. My
phone is 303-275-7224. Sorry for the long winded message. Hope you have a
good weekend.
