The Default Customer List has been updated.  To obtain the new password,
please call Supplier Services at 508-357-4700.


> An Internet FTP site has been set up for access to the Massachusetts
> Electric Default Customer lists.  See the information below on the FTP
> site details and for setting up your FTP software for file download.   If
> you would prefer to receive the list on a Zip Disk, please let me know.
>
> The package WS_FTP Pro is suggested for downloading the files.  It is
> available for purchase and download from http://wsftp.com for about $40.
> Once WS_FTP is obtained and loaded, you will need to set up an entry
> representing the Masselectric FTP server.
>
> 	FTP site name:	ftp.us.ngrid.com
> 	FTP site IP address:	204.164.80.201
> 	User ID: 	Obtain from Masselectric Supplier Services  Call
> (508) 357-4700
> 	Password:	Obtain from Masselectric Supplier Services
>
> *	Open WS_FTP Pro - you will see a screen with two windows side by
> side, with a 'WS_FTP Sites' dialog box on top.
> *	In the WS_FTP sites dialog box:
> *	click 'New' - another dialog box will open
> *	select 'Create a FTP site', and type 'ftp.us.ngrid.com' on the "With
> Name" line - click 'Next'
> *	in the next dialog box, fill in Host Name or IP Address:
> '204.164.80.201' -- click 'Next'
> *	in the next (and last) last dialog box, fill in User ID (do not
> click 'Anonymous'), fill in the Password, and click 'Finish'
> *	Toggle the tab within WS_FTP Pro for this entry to default to
> "nonpassive mode" ftp.
> *	Record the user ID and password for future access - you will be
> prompted for it whenever you attempt to use the 'ftp.us.ngrid.com' site.
> *	Now you will see the WS_FTP two-window screen with a new directory
> entry in the right screen under 'MySites' named 'ftp.us.ngrid.com'.  The
> left screen is the directory of your PC and network.
> *	You may obtain the User ID and Password from Mass Electric Supplier
> Services.  The Password will be changed periodically to control access to
> the customer lists.
>
> If you already have FTP software other than WS_FTP Pro, it may be used for
> the downloads.  You will need to set up the software using the site and
> access information above.
>
> To transfer files from the FTP site, start Ws_FTP, and select the
> "destination" directory for the download in the left (local) window.  Open
> the 'ftp.us.ngrid.com' site in the right window (password required).  In
> the right screen, select the file(s) to be transferred, and either
> drag-and-drop or use the "arrow" controls to transfer it to the
> destination directory.  The file will be transferred into the selected
> directory in the left window.  It can now be unzipped on the local
> machine.
>
> If you have any questions, please let me know.
