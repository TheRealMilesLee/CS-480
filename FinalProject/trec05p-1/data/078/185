	Ken Cessac reported to me today concerning a problem with Northern's chromatograph at the Bushton Plant that occurred on 9/19 after a routine annual replacement of calibration gas by ETS, and that was fixed yesterday, although Ken needs to review the fix.  In a nutshell, the problem appears likely to have caused the volumes to be off for the period of time at issue; it is yet to be determined whether the Btu's per MMBtu will be off.  Angela Mendez apparently caught this when certain values started repeating themselves.  I am told that a similar problem was experienced when the chromatograph was first installed years ago, but thought to have been fixed.  
	
	Once Ken has finished his review and I have spoken with Rick Kile, we can draft the appropriate letter.  

	I will continue to keep you advised.

	Britt
