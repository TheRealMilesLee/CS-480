Hey Moma Dee,
 
Sorry i haven't been in touch with ya, i have been a little tied up lately.  When i got to work today, i decided to email hope and quentin. And after i finished I thought this is something that the whole church might need to hear.  So tell me what you think.
 
The last part is ment as The devil's mess took them and God MIGHT place them somewhere else. Okay write back soon.

Yall I know yall are tired and need a brake.  But I'm going to let yall know, while yall are taking that brake, the devil is going to come in on that brake and do his work for you.  Hope when i talk to you last, I asked were you going to be at choir rehearsal and you said, "Why i ain't going to be there Sunday." and you are right, but do you have to get all your blessing through the week, and then give him the praise on sunday. You of all people know that you don't need to have a sunday moring experience on sunday, you can have it in a jail tank on tuesday and wendsday.  When you are in a relationship, you are going to do all you can to make it work, if you or quentin didn't have ride, why didn't yall ask me, have i ever turned yall down. Make it work.
 
Quentin, where have you been.  I am going to real with ya.  When you started coming to the church, You and I was thrilled. I was like finaly, i got someone who is on my level who if in case didn't have a right spirit, I could lift up and if i didn't have the right spirit, he could lift me up.  I felt that now it's not only me who can get through to these other young men and be there sort of mentor.  I have help now, i don't have to be the only one checking on Matthew, Woyne, Damion, Anthony, Marcus, Mann, Kalid,  Howard, Devin, and not to mention the girls.  Now me and him can be there Accounters, especially for the first four.  Well now we don't have to worry about at least one of the the four, Matthew.  I'm  not sure, but he doesn't go to the church anymore, nor his family.  And i am not saying it your fault, but you act like if they are not rapping, you don't need to be worried about them, i'm being real.  I always ask you,"Q, have you talk to the boys."  
 
I can't stress this enough, Your presence at the church is greatly missed. And you might say" well, everybody ain't able to have a nine to five,  you got to take what you can get." And that is exactly what the devil wants you to feel...Notice I never said your presence on suday morning is greatly missed, i said your presence at the church is.  Powertime, Choir Rehearsal, Young adult functions, Afternoon functions, 2nd services, Meetings...You might not see it, but the only God that some of the people might see is through you. You might say, "Well, if they are going to church just to see me, then they are going for the wrong reason." right. But everybody is not on the same spiritual level as us.  They are following by example and if they never see you we may never see them. And Hope you already know how we feel about you and the kind of spirit your presence bring.
 
Hope I told you in an email before i went to jail that i almost wanted to give up. And i was still considering it when i typed that. Be careful of what you asked because you just might get it. On that day, I was at work. My supervisor asked me to take some checks down stairs about 4 floors down.  I waited for an elevator for a good three minutes, and i figured this was my chance to really talk to God.  And i asked hime to give me a renewed spirit, but not all of sudden. Let it be gradually.  I promise, when i said a man the elevator opened. Well that evening i went to jail.  And it was in that jail tank, God renewed my spirit. Now i can go to choir rehearsal again without thinking about how much i don't like Andrew, I can still go to church even though two vital families aren't there (Davis's and the Abrahams), i can type this letter to yall, and still not worry how yall might see me later. All i am saying is don't wait until you hit rock bottom to be about God's business again.  It's Real good that you Believe in God and you read your Bible.  Keep in mind that The devil also belives in God and knows the Bible back wards and forwards, He comes to Steal (Davis's and Abrahams) Kill (Our Spirit) and Destroy (Our Church).
 
Please take heed to what I am saying and I am not saying this because I want to get under yalls skin, i am writing it because i am not holding nothing in anymore, because thats what got my spirits down in the first place. 
 
And still much luv, You know how we do it.
