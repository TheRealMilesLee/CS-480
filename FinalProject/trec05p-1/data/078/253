Linda has informed plaintiff's counsel that the next round of depositions will more than likely have to take place in December because her November calendar is full.  I understand the process of scheduling deposition preparation meetings and depositions of K. Rice and K. Hannon are to be scheduled by you or your staff.  Please let me know their availability for approximately 1/2 -3/4 day prep and full day of deposition in December.  Thank you.  Lisa

Hartman.

See you on Wednesday.

P.S.  Do you have any available dates yet for the depositions of Ken Rice,
Kevin Hannon, Marnie Cosse, and Chad Beers?
