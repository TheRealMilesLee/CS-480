I don't know whether other people who suffer from chronic diseases have the
same feeling. To recieve a refi11 seems to take a greater amount of time
than it should. And the prices on tableets are scary. I have heard from

proved so. The prices on rxdrugs are really reduced from other stores. Thank
you for providing this wonderful arrangement. -- Mark J. in SD<br>
