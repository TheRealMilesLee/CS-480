   aspersion \uh-SPUR-zhuhn; -shuhn\, noun:
   1. A damaging or derogatory remark; slander.
   2. The act of defaming or slandering.
   3.   A   sprinkling   with   water,  especially  in  religious
   ceremonies.

     Orley  had  once  been  forced to resign from a local men's
     club  for  casting  aspersions  on the character of another
     member's wife.
     --Thomas A. Underwood, Allen Tate: Orphan of the South

     Its meetings were fiercely argumentative; members seemed to
     love nothing better than to cast aspersions on each other's
     intellect and class loyalty.
     --Glenn Frankel, [1]Rivonia's Children
     _________________________________________________________

   Aspersion  is  from Latin aspersio, from aspergere, from ad- +
