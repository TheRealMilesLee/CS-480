   levity \LEV-uh-tee\, noun:
   1.   Lightness   of   manner   or   speech,   especially  when
   inappropriate or excessive; frivolity.
   2. Lack of steadiness or constancy; changeableness.

     They sat there in their formal bargeman's rig... looking
     solemn:  they were part of a ceremony, and levity, winking,
     whispering, smiling, had no place in it.
     --Patrick O'Brian, [1]The Hundred Days

     I must say that if the doctor was indulging in levity at my
     expense, it is a levity I find in the worst possible taste.
     --Alfred Alcorn, Murder in the Museum of Man
     _________________________________________________________

   Levity is from Latin levitas, from levis, "light."
