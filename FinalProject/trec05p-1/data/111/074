We have received the following questions from the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg.  We will not necessarily respond, but would you please provide answers and let me know your view whether or not we should respond to the following:

Have you had any further contact from Fitch? (DeSpain)

Has there been a change in status to the SEC inquiry?  Which office is handling - Fort Worth? (Rogers)

Have you been contacted by the Federal Reserve or any other agency conducting an investigation? (Rogers)

Have you been in contact with or retained bankruptcy counsel? (Haedicke)

Have you been contacted about a takeover - Royal Dutch, GE?

Have you retained Goldman Sachs to advise you on credit rating, financing issues or to find a strategic partner?  Will they receive an equity stake to help Enron get out of its current situation?  (Bowen)


These reporters are on deadline tonight, so let me know as soon as possible.

Thank you.
