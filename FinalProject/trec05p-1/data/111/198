This year's trip is going to be fantastic!!

Itinerary

Bangkok, Thailand offers incredible temples, outstanding cuisine, fantastic
shopping and the friendliest people youve ever met. Thailand is called the
Land of a Thousand Smiles for good reason.

Siem Reap (Angkor), Cambodia: The magnificent temples of Angkor have only
recently opened to tourism after years of civil war and unrest. Now is a
perfect time to visit these timeless wonders before they are marred by the
rapid growth in tourism.

Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), Vietnam: This is the most vibrant and dynamic
country in Southeast Asia. Saigon is sophisticated, exciting and endlessly
fascinating, from its glorious French colonial architecture to its modern
club scene and nightlife.

Nha Trang, Vietnam: Endless white sand beaches, warm sunshine, tropical
breezes. Need we say more?

Singapore: We will only have one overnight in Singapore as a result of the
airline schedule. But what a great city to spend a night! Discover Little
India, Arab Street, pubs along Boat Quay or sample Malay cuisine at a hawker
stand.
