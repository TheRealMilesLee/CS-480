Sally,

I was part of the employee breakfast this morning and thought it went well.  

As an idea, my group (Laura Johnson) publishes the  Enron Net Works News intranet site.  I know you've got an article out there already.  Would you like to use ENN as a forum for answering some of the questions or perhaps making a statement about "leadership"?  

I'll be glad to send Laura your way and hold up the current publication so your message is timely to the troops.

Rich Hall
