Rick -- here is the offer letter for Paul.  I believe it has everything noted except if we are going to allow for a house hunting trip prior to his moving.  I'm told this is usually done in conjunction with a business trip, so I'm not sure if that could be worked in for Paul.

In addition, to get any questions answered he may have about the benefits in Mexico, I would suggest that he call
Melizza Evanson, the HR Rep that is the liaison for our employees in Mexico.  She works very closely with the HR/Payroll people in Mexico and is the most knowledgeable.  Tim Callahan did say that the Benefits in the UK are greater than they are even in the US, and the benefits in the US are even greater than those in Mexico.  However, he didn't elaborate on the specifics of any particular benefits.  Melizza did say that the cost of living in Mexico is extremely low, so the employees there are provided with a driver, maids, etc. 

Anyway, take a look at the letter and let me know if you need any revisions.  And please have Paul call Melizza directly at 
(713) 345-7855 
with any questions.

Thanks.
Jo Ann
