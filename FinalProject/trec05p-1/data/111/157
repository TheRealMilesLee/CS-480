Michelle -- per our discussion, please prepare a new Separation Agreement and Release for Frank Stabler with the only change being the termination date from November 1, 2001 to December 1, 2001.

Please note that the first lump sum payment has been processed and will be paid on the 10/31/01 paycheck.  In addition, there is the next payment due on 11/15/01.  These severance payments will be paid prior to the termination date.

Please let me know when the documents are ready and I'll arrange to have them sent to Frank for execution.
Thanks.
Jo Ann
