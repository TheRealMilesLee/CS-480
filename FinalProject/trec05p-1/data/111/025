The newly formed California Consumer Power and Financing Authority is working to finalize the drafts of three request for bids (RFBs), one for fuel cells, one for micro turbines and one for decentralized photovoltaics. The Authority is bringing the draft RFBs before their board for approval on Nov. 2nd.    To view the draft RFBs click on the following link:

Created by Senate Bill 6 (Burton), the Power Authority is charged with ensuring reasonably priced, long-term availability of reliable supply of electricity and natural gas, promoting environmentally friendly supply and demand solutions, and achieving adequate capacity reserves by 2006. With its ability to issue up to $5 billion in revenue bond indebtedness, the Authority's five-person Board will look at a variety of options to meet its charge.

The authority's immediate stated intent is to build "a portfolio that combines 1,000 MW of renewable energy with perhaps 2,000 MW of peaking units and load management which the Authority can dispatch at a moments notice will provide the state with the best opportunity to meet capacity needs as soon as summer 2002."

Please let me know if you need more information.  I'll update you with the outcome from the 11/2 board meeting.
