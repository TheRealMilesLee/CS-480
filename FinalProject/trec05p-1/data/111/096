Group-
Brace yourselves...
Once more we are experiencing seasonal changes. The time zone change has pushed the evening peak back to HE 18 through HE 19. These hours are now premium, the load curve no longer resembles a rolling hill but has an extreme morning ramp and an extreme evening ramp. Both EPE and the CAISO in NP-15 will have difficulty with this evening ramp. Do not count on the EPE load forecast to accurately identify the evening ramp. We should not suck off the grid. Pay the extra $3 for firm or unit contingent power in the SW. We need to attack the evening peak early and make sure we cover it. We should be using congestion wheels as hedges. A 200 mw import requires a 200 mw wheel going in the opposite direction at $0.10--or less--we should not do 50 mws at $50 as we would still have to pay $50 on the other 150 mws if we get awarded all 50 mws of relief. We will discuss this in our meeting next Tuesday November 6th at 4:30. Let's be sharp and not give away hard-earned revenue on congestion mis-management or poor scheduling. 

Any questions? Comments? Ideas? Bring them to the meeting on next Tuesday.

Thanks,

Bill
