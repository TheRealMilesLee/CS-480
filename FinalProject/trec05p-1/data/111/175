***POLL***
Online or Bio terrorism: what's more likely? 
Vote now!
http://www.informationsecurityworld.com/Tmpl/ArchPolls.asp?CID=16

Our latest poll has been running for a week, and so far the results have been close. Next week we will deliver the results of the poll, and bring a new issue to vote on. To suggest a poll question, please contact us - we'd love to hear from you!

***PORTAL DISCUSSION***
Our current topic is 'Back door laws: will they work?'
One reader has stated:
"This is and always will be a bad idea. Commerce needs the strongest possible encryption that is practical. Limiting encryption strength and putting in back doors is bad for business. With more and more commerce happening on the Internet, the only way forward is strong encryption and user authentication."

Speak up - or else you will never be heard!
