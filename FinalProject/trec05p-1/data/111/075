You can go ahead and send it to me as I am sure I will be performing the review at some point.

Thanks,
Stacey

Kristin and Stacey-

I know that we probably won't be performing the UK Power doorsteps, but I did receive the NETA papers that Chris had sent.  Do you all have an interest in getting a copy?  Let me know.  Thanks,

Christy
