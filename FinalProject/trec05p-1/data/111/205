Wednesday is a mess for me, I might be able to do a 5:00 pm CST in the car on the way home from Intergalactic Airport.  I have a 5:00 pm EST call with Polaroid as does Lisa on Tuesday.    It may make sense to do it after that at around 6 pm EST/3 pm PDT.  Let's let Emy Geraldo know what works and schedule a call-in.

Can we have chat again between now and COB Wednesday (like we did night before PG&E meeting) to get ourselves in order for the Edison meeting?
