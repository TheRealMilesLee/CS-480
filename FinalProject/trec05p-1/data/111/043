Hi All,

If you are available to help us out tomorrow evening (Tuesday, October 30) 
at the Open House in downtown San Francisco, we'd be very appreciative.

We've had a few volunteers, but would like to have more current students 
present to answer questions for the prospectives. We're expecting a fairly 
large crowd in San Francisco and the more students that are there, the 
stronger the program will look to them.

The Agenda for the evening runs from 6:30 - 8:30 PM. The event is at the 
Palace Hotel in San Francisco (at Market and New Montgomery).

I hope you will be able to be there and help us market the program.  Please 
let me know if you can attend or not.

Thank you!
Meg
