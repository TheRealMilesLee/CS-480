The upset bug has struck again on The Road To Rocketsville <http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=157867&UID=45456540&MID=206753>.   <http://www.nba.com/media/rockets/rtr_bullard.jpg>

Following last week's shocking upset by No. 14 Phil Ford, who ousted No. 3 Scottie Pippen in the Southeast Regional, No. 13 Matt Bullard pulled off another shocker by defeating No. 4 Glen Rice - 67 percent to 33 percent - in the West Regional. We also had our closest battle to date, as No. 7 Robert Horry (612 total votes) edged No. 10 Kenny Thomas (589) to move on to face Clyde Drexler in the second round. Click here <http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=157868&UID=45456540&MID=206753> to see all the results from the West Regional First Round.
