Effective 2/1/02 a new company will go into effect called ENNG.  The company code is 179E.

The primary purpose of this company is to account for the payroll of the Enron employees who are currently on company 0179, and who will remain Enron employees after the 2/1/02 transition of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy.  

With respect to coding invoices, recording time and other similar transactions on Northern Natural Gas (0179) please note the following that are effective 2/1/02:
 
If you have expenses that you normally would charge to a 0179 FAR order or project, continue using the same codes.  No changes here.
If you have expenses that you normally would charge to a 0179 cost center, use the same cost center number except replace the first digit with a 5.  For example, if you would have charged 111222, charge 511222 instead.  These "5" series cost centers have been set up on company 179E, but their payroll and expenses flow into company 0179.  You will not be able to code direct to a 0179 cost center after January business (1/31/02).  
If you are becoming a Dynegy employee on 2/1/02, your time entry for January and corrections to any prior period must be entered before noon on 2/1/02.  After noon on 2/1/02 do not enter your time into eHRonline or the SAP timekeeping application.  During the next week or two we will be working with Dynegy on an alternative for capturing and accounting for your time and payroll expenses.
If you are currently a 0179 employee and are continuing as an Enron employee, your time entry for January and corrections to any prior period must be entered before noon on 2/1/02.  After noon on 2/1/02 continue entering your time as you ordinarily would.  Unless you exception code to FAR orders or projects, your hours will automatically go into the appropriate "5" series cost center on company 179E.  

If you have any questions or need additional information concerning these coding changes please contact Trey Meerbott at (713) 853-7003.
