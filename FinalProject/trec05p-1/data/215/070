Attached are comments of Snohomish PUD on the Scheduling Coordinator and
Paying Agent Agreement and a separate set of comments on the Bylaws
revisions.  We recognize that the Filing Utilities requested that the
comments on the SC/Paying Agent be filed by yesterday, but we needed a few
extra hours to allow for internal review and consideration of the Filing
Utility proposals and the clarifications presented last Friday.  In addition
we endorse the comments filed yesterday by the Western Public Agencies
Group, of which we are a member.
