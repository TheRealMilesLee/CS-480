A woman was sitting at a bar enjoying an after-work cocktail with
her girlfriends when an exceptionally tall, handsome, extremely
sexy young man entered. He was so striking that the woman could
not take her eyes away from him. The young man noticed her overly-attentive 
stare and walked directly toward her. Before she could
offer her apologies for being so rude for staring, the young man
said to her. "I'll do anything, absolutely anything,
that you want me to do, no matter how kinky, for $20. on one condition."

Flabbergasted, the woman asked what the condition was. The young man
replied, "You have to tell me what you want me to do in just three words."

The woman considered his proposition for a moment, withdrew from
her purse and - slowly counted out four $5 bill, which she
pressed into the young man's hand along with her address. She
looked deeply into his eyes, and
s l o w l y, meaningfully said .......




"CLEAN MY HOUSE."
