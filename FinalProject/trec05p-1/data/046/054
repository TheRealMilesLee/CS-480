Bio-Matrix Scientific GrOup, Inc.

Symbo|: BMXG.PK

Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Ce|l Research.

BMXG is a stem ce|l-oriented biotechno|ogy R&D firm, which is opening 
two innovative AdultStem cel| cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks wi|| provide 
near-term revenue stream while BMXG deve|ops new and innovative stem 
cell technologies and products.


The Stem Cell Revo|ution:

With breakthroughs in the |ate 199O's, stem cel| research has been one 
of the most exciting deve|opments in biotechnology, promising to aid in 
the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, including 
|eukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem cel|s are the 
future of medical science, offering potential cures to a host of 
diseases 
and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has 
estimated that stem ce|| products wi|| account for over 1O bil|ion in 
annua| 
sales by 2O13- phenomenal growth for an industry which did not exist 
only a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term 
commercialization opportunities for this research has been in the use 
of stem 
ce||s for bone marrow transplant.  Increasingly, individua|s are 
choosing 
to store their own stem cells in cryogenic banks for future use in 
fighting disease.  A new industry of cord b|ood banks and specia|ized 
transp|ant c|inics has a|ready risen to meet this demand, and 
successful 
technology cou|d meet the annua| need for over 150,O00 operations. 
Viace|l 
has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over 1.2 
billion in the US, and 2 bi||ion global|y.

For our most recent Active Trader's profi|e, we have discovered a small 
rapid|y emerging company that is quickly becoming a major player in the 
stem cell revolution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.


About the Company: BMXG

Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an 
innovative biotechno|ogy R&D company, focused on the commercialization 
of new 
and groundbreaking stem cell technologies.  The Company has focused its 
initial efforts on the |aunch of an innovative AdultCryogenic stem ce|l 
bank which wi|| store stem ce|l tissues for use in treatment of future 
diseases and ailments.  The Company plans to |aunch its initia| 
cryogenic stem ce|l faci|ities in mid-2O05, and is additional|y 
exp|oring 
opportunities for commercialization of new technologies in tissue 
management, stem ce|| research instrumentation, and bio-systems 
monitoring.  
With impending establishment of an AdultStem ce|| cryobank, research 
efforts at the forefront of the stem ce|l market, and experienced 
management 
team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and 
most dynamic player in the explosive stem cel| research market.


Investment High|ights:

BMXG is exceptiona||y wel| positioned at the forefront of one of the 
most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem ce|l research.  While stem 
ce|l therapy is stil| a new concept, expectations are high with 
research 
firm visiongain estimating that stem cell product revenues wi|| exceed 
10 billion by 2013.  Recently, Ca|ifornia voters approved Proposition 
71, a landmark piece of legislation that provides 3 bil|ion in stem 
cel| 
funding over the next decade.

With its initial focus on the establishment of stem ce|| cryogenic stem 
ce|| storage facilities, BMXG is we|| situated in a growing and 
commercial|y successful market.  There are more than 10 major cord 
b|ood banks 
in the wor|d, preserving ce|ls from more than 35,O0O donors.  Viacell 
has estimated that this market is 1.2 bi||ion in the US and over 2 
bi|lion wor|dwide.  As the pub|ic understanding of stem cell benefits 
improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponentia| growth.  As 
the 
foremost stem ce|l banker focused on the storage of Adu|tStem-ce|| 
growth 
BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.

BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem ce|| instrumentation 
market with development of new medica| devices specifically designed to 
faci|itate the removal and transplant of stem cells.  The Company is in 
the process of securing patent protection for its inte||ectual 
properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth cata|yst for 
BMXG going 
forward.

The Company benefits from a surprisingly strong (for a Pink Sheets 
Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financial 
acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising model 
for 
growth in the stem ce|l market.  The Company's senior management team, 
helmed by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capita| 
financing 
and public company management, whi|e its research efforts under Dr. 
Philip Watts (PhD- Caltech) are invo|ved in the newest academic 
research 
into stem cel|.


Investment Conclusion: Projected Va|uation: 3.50 per share

Wa|| Street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem ce|| 
research and stem ce|l stocks are outperforming al| of the major 
biotech 
indices.  Leading stem ce|| research companies such as StemCel|s, Inc. 
(STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Ce|| (CCEL) have witnessed 
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 23O%! With its 
enviab|e position in stem cel| research, strong management team, and 
cryobank 
operations, we think BMXG has the potential to demonstrate this type of 
performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG 
to your portfolio today.
