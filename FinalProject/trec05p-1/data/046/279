Dear Friend,

I am Mr. Erick Von Heinz, the bills and exchange manager of a bank in
Switzerland. I am contacting you on business transfer of a huge sum of money
from a deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude
will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all
will be well at the end of the day. We decided to contact you due to the
urgency of this
transaction.

PROPOSITION;
We discovered an abandoned sum of US$5,500,000.00(five million five hundred
thousand united states dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our
foreign customers who died along with his entire family. Since his death,
none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward to lay claims for
this money as the heir. We cannot release the fund from his account unless
someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in
our banking guidelines. Upon this discovery, we now seek your permission to
have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will
be carefully worked out by us for the funds (US$5,500,000.00) to be
released in your favor as the beneficiary's next of kin. It may interest you
to know that we have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate
any of deceased beneficiaries.

Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual
business
endeavor by furnishing me with the following;
1. Beneficiary name and address
2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers
These requirements will enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate
Departments for necessary approvals in your favor before the transfer can be
made. We shall be compensating you with a million dollars on final
conclusion of this project, while the rest shall be for us. Your share stays
while
the rest shall be for us for investment purposes.

If this proposal is acceptable to you, do not take undue advantage of the
trust we have bestowed on you, I await your urgent mail.

Regards,
Mr. Von Heinz.
