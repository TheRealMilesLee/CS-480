HELP STOP THE SHIFT OF OVER $600 MILLION OF POWER COSTS FROM S. CALIFORNIA
TO N. AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA RATEPAYERS.

Please call the PUC at 415 703 2074 to voice your opposition to this unfair
plan.  Details and talking points are below.

***********
According to the California Public Utilities Commission's (CPUC) draft
decision on the California Department of Water Resources’s (DWR) revenue
requirement (attached), the CPUC is proposing to shift over $600 million of
unreviewed DWR power costs to PG&E’s customers from Southern California
customers.  If adopted by the CPUC, this would lock PG&E customers into
40-55 percent higher rates for DWR power over the next 10 years, compared to
customers of Southern California Edison and SDG&E.  It discriminates against
PG&E’s customers and has not been subject to public review, due process, or
cost justification by DWR or the CPUC.

The CPUC has postponed the vote on the DWR cost shifting issue until later
this month (Sept 20th, or sooner).  Without a full public hearing at which
all the cost and ratemaking issues can be aired, Northern and Central
California customers will not have a full and fair opportunity to review DWR
’s multi-billion dollar rate demands and will be unable to influence these
proceedings.

The SVMG is strongly urging you to call the CPUC as well as your local
legislators (contact information attached) to gain their support in opposing
this unjustified and discriminatory rate shift.  Main issues of concern are:
1)the unfair shift of over $600 million in costs from SCE customers to PG&E
customers; 2)imposes higher Direct Access exit fees in Northern CA. than in
Southern CA.; 3)appears to fund a portion of SCE's debt repayment on the
backs of PG&E customers without any justification from the CPUC (please find
further talking points attached).

We are asking that the CPUC conduct open public hearings so that public
comment can be provided, and the DWR's basis for cost recovery can be
reviewed.  Thank you for your prompt support in this crucial effort.

If you have any further questions, contact Justin Bradley at the SVMG at
408-501-7852.
