Great!  I'll look forward to meeting you.  Candis is doing very well - she currently has a 91.  Please remind her, however, that she needs to serve her buyback time at lunch on Monday with Ms. Bay.

Hi,

I got your email.  Thank you for keeping me up on what's going on.  I
was at the school yesterday sitting in on some of Candis' classes but I
didn't get to make it in time to see you.  Hopefully I will be able to
meet you during Open House. Until then, thanks again.

Hi, 

This is your child's English teacher - finally got your E-mail addresses
into my address book.  Please reply so I know you got this message ...

In case you do, you should know that we have a quiz tomorrow in class
over their homework tonight, which counts half their grade.  The
assignment should be written down in their agendas.  It is to read p.
456-8 and answer the questions on p. 459, exercise 2, #1-10.

Thanks!

Wendy Koebernick
