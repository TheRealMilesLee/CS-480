Chairman Contract Award and
Payment Review Committee of
Sudan.
Personal +249-11-839-5678 

Dear Sir/Madam, 

First, let me apologise for contacting you through email for the fact that we have not met before. I must tell you quite frankly that this is my only possible means presently because of the intense political Problems here in Sudan.  

I am "MR. CHARLES ROUBI" The Chairman of Contract Award and Payment Review Committee (CAPRC) with the Executive Government of Sudan. Before the war in Sudan, we have means of payment to every foreign contractor registered under the Companies and Allied Matters Act of 1996, in which every approved foreign beneficiary with (CAPRC) should be paid through our reserved fund with Global Finance in Europe, since the Law on foreign policy in SUDDAN does not allow money transfer only to receive.

During the war here in Sudan, our office was destroyed and many of our valuable files were burnt. Also, during the time of our relocation everything was recorded as lost of life and properties, not knowing that we still have the sum of Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars (US$15.5M) which was approved for supply of official cars for the Contract Award and Payment Review Committee (CAPRC) staffs. It is highly secret to inform you that I have copy of all files in my house, and since the money have been forgotten, I would like to present you as a contractor approved for supply of official cars for the (CAPRC) staffs.

Note, the Global Finance take Authority from me before releasing any amount to the beneficiary since is our most secured source of Foreign Payment. Be rest assured that it is very easy to release the money to you once i Authorize the Global Finance. In the light of the above, send me your name address and personal contact number so that i will pass it over to the global finance Confirming that you are the beneficiary of the said approved contract amount. And subsequently Authorizing them to effect the release of the money in your favour. I am moved to do this because my family have pleaded with me to quit my job as a civil servant due to the recent political and economic instability in the Country. 

But, i will only do that when this success have been achieved, we also plan to leave this Nation for safety and it is highly important you receive the money to enable me establish a solid investment that will sustain my Family hopefully in your Country after the funds is transfered into your account. As regards your assistance, May I say that 40% of the total sum will go to you as compensation. Thank you for your anticipated co-operation as you reply promptly. 

Please reply this message today whether interested or not, kindly let me hear from you so as to know what next.

Yours Faithfully, 
MR. CHARLES ROUBI
