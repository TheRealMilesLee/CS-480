Something strange happened in Enpower yesterday.  A deal from the STNW book was changed and we aren't sure why.  It appears that some strips from a $180 sale in NP15 were erased.  Our theory is that something happened between FSP and Enpower that erased these strips.  Of course, we don't know what happened, which is why I am contacting you.  This is really scary if our systems are changing deals.  The only reason that we noticed was because of a huge P&L hit to the STNW book.  If the price of the deal had been closer to current market we wouldn't have noticed.  Please look into this and let the trading team know what happened.
