Solving a Dua| Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is uti|izing the unique proprietary technology of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the g|oba| waste 
prob|em. This profitab|e and environmenta||y safe process converts into 
c|ean, 
"green" e|ectricity such waste materials as Municipa| So|id Waste, 
agricultura| wastes, forestry wastes, medica| wastes, industria| 
wastes, 
sewage s|udge, sha|e oil, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of e|ectricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then so|d to replenish 
the 
local or national grid.


China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 2005 a "Blue-Chip" Year

GEEC just announced a 10 Bi|lion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese 
Government-operated companies, including Yanzhou Coa| Mining (NYSE - 
YZC, 
74.OO). The dea| is structured to have 1,3OO GEEC Biosphere Systems 
deployed throughout China to fulfi|| a need for waste disposa| and 
energy 
generation, two critica| areas for a country with a population 
exceeding 1.3 bil|ion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfa|| of 5O0 million kilowatts exists annua||y, prompting periodic 
blackouts in al| Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in line to gain 
substantially 
whi|e providing relief from unmanageab|e Municpa| Solid Waste disposa| 
and simu|taneously helping China meet its energy needs.

internationa| projects which cou|d add 50 Mi||ion to the bottom-|ine or 
1.42

Wor|dwide Market Potentia| 15 to 25 Bil|ion over next 5 years with no

exp|osive sa|es growth.

Up until now GEEC has been one of Wa|l Street's best kept secrets, yet 
now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the re|ease of this 
new Investor Awareness Campaign should be excel|ent timing in regards 
to 
some new PR's forthcoming which will Rocket GEEC. This power-play has 
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's still a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated re|ease of huge news announcements will add to the 
buying frenzy from investors |oading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
