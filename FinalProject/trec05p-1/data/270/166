From: Mr. Henry Ossai,  

Unclaimed Fund (Late Engr. Douglas Briggs Estate)
 
I am sending you this private email to make a passionate appeal to you fo=
r
assistance. Kindly accept my apology for contacting you this way and forg=
ive
me if this is not acceptable to you. My name is Henry Ossai; I am an audi=
tor
at one of the Nigerian Banks in Lagos-Nigeria.

During our last audit exercise, some amount of money totaling $18.5Millio=
n
was discovered and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Douglas Briggs=
,
a foreigner who died in a crash. The source of this fund was further trac=
ed
to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.=

Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracte=
d
our curiosity. I therefore made a research and found out that he did not
leave any next of kin in his confidential document with the Ministry that=

he executed the contract for and also with our Bank. A panel setup by the=

Federal Government on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be
unquestionably claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alt=
ernatively
the fund should be donated for arms and ammunition at a military war coll=
ege
here in Nigeria.
 
Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any
of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail. It is because=

of the perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate any next
of kin (he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence
of our chairman, Rtd Major General Thomas Dan Ababa, that arrangement is
being made for the fund to be declared UNCLAIMABLED and then be donated
to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition which will further enhance the
perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestal=
l
this move, my colleagues and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for=

a foreign partner who could assist in claiming this fund for further tran=
sfer
abroad. I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soo=
n
as possible to that effect.

All documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully
worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share=

would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would
be set aside to offset all expenses in course of the transfer and the res=
t
would be for us for investment purposes in your country after the transfe=
r.
If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the advantage of
the trust we hope to bestow on you or your company, then kindly reach me
Immediately via my confidential email account (ossaaihenryx4@wanadoo.es>
furnishing me with your most confidential telephone and fax numbers and
exclusive email so that I can forward to you the relevant details of the
transaction.

I will be waiting for your response. My telephone number is +234 803 650
4986.

Regards,
Mr. Henry Ossai
