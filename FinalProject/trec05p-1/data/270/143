consequently won the lottery in the RED category.

You have therefore been approved for a lump sum payout of $3,000,000.00 (three

a total cash prize of U.S. $31million shared among several international lucky
winners in this category.

CONGRATULATIONS. Your fund is now deposited with our Security
Department/Correspondent Bank to your name and due to mix up of some numbers
