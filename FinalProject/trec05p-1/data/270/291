THE FINICIAL ADVICER
FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA.(F.N.B).
JOHANNESBURG
SOUTH AFRICA.


ATTENTION: SIR/MADAM,

I do understand the concern this letter will bring  to you for the fact that it comes from a total stranger, but be rest assured for it comes with good
intentions.I got your contact through the South African International Exchange Network On-line here in Johannesburg, South Africa.

For purpose of introduction i am Mr. Wisdom Collins , The Finicial Advicer of FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA(F.N.B). There is an account opened in this bank since 1980 and since 1995 nobody has operated on this account again. After going through some old files in the records, i discovered that if i don't remmitt this money out urgently it would be forfieted for nothing. 

The owner of this account is Mr.Smith .B. Andreas, a foreigner and a miner at Kruger Gold Co-operation, a geologist by profession and he died since 1994. No other person knows about this account or any thing 
concerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that the company does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is USD$12.500.000.00(Twelve Million Five hundred thousand United States Dollars).

I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this  money cannot be approved to a local bank here,but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in United States Dollars and the former owner of the account Mr. Smith .B.Andreas is a foreigner
too.
This business is real and 100% safe, Please reply urgently so that i will inform you the next step to take immediately.
I am contacting you because of the need to involve a  foreigner with a foreign account and as a foreign  beneficiary i need your full co-operation to make  this work fine because the management is ready to  approve this payment to any foreigner,who has the correct information and pass word of this account, which i will give to you later.If you are capable 
and willing to handle such an amount in strict  confidence and trust according to my instructions  and advice for our mutual benefit because this opportunity might not come again in  life

I need  a truthfull person in this business because i don't  want to make mistakes. I need your strong assurance and trust .
With my position  now in office i can transfer this money to any foreign  reliable account,through on-line banking or Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending my physical arrival to your country for sharing .
I will apply for annual leave to get a visa immediately i hear from you that you are ready to act and receive this money in your account.

At the conclusion of this business,i will come to your country for withdrawal and sharing and other investments. you will be given 30% of the total amount, 70% will be for me ,and while 10% will be for
expenses both parties might incure during the process of transfering this money.


Therefore, if you are willing and interested to renderthe needed assistance, endeavor to reply through my email address or my private telephone number which is 27-83-434-3299 I also need your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication.I will give more 
clarifications on the modalities needed for the successful completion of this transaction. . 

Best Regards,
Wisdom Collins
