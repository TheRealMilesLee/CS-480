Could you please get us the document you referenced below.  Andersen is asking for it.

There is an Agreement and Consent document between Dyn, NNG and the banks that allows us to do this. The preferred stock did not provide for any secured interest in the pipes nor any pledge of the common stock.

Jim:
I am heading over to Bracewell's office at 3 pm to start the signing process.  We will not fund until midday tomorrow.  Call me on my cell phone or email if you need to reach me.  Do I owe you any docs?
