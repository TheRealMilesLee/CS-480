Nidia:

Thanks for your help with this.  Following is the list of entities that we
have transactions with on an monthly basis:

Enron North America	-	Natural Gas

Enron Gas Liquids 	- 	Propane & Butane

Transwestern Pipeline	-	We have a contract with you to use your
pipeline which creates a receivable for you at $125,000 per month.

All of these transactions are done with Richardson Energy Marketing, Ltd.
You had said that Sid Richardson Carbon & Gasoline was purchasing butane
from you, however that is incorrect.  Everything should be going through
Richardson Energy Marketing, Ltd.

We would like the ability to net out our exposures each month across all
Enron entities where we have activity.  I am told it is not something we
will necessarily do each month, but you like to have the option at least.
If you have any questions, please call me at 817-339-7410.

Best regards,
Bill Hayes
Richardson Energy Marketing, Ltd.
