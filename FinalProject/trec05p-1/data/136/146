Debra:

Thank you for your call and invitation.  Danny appreciates the invitation/breakfast meeting with Governor Knowles but, unfortunately due to current business, he will not be able to attend.  
I have advised Eric Gadd of your invitation and he will response when he returns to the office on Monday, November 26th.  
Please call me at 713-853-3597 if needed, otherwise Susan Wadle from Eric Gadd's office will be following up next week.    Thank you.
