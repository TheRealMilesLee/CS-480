This means that the DST proceeding moves forward - right?

How about a phone call at 3pm HOUSTON TIME to catch up on all matters?

We have been informed that at this morning's status hearing, without
substantive discussion, the ALJ in the Illinois Power proceeding denied
Enron's motion to strike.  Please feel free to call if you would like to
discuss.  Thank you.
