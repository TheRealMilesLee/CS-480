	Marianne,

	This will confirm our conference regarding your further due diligence.  Here are the to-do's:

	1.  You will call Steve Schneider and anyone else you need to to find out whether a database still exists that captures all ENA-related sale and/or transport contracts for Zapata county from 1980-1995.

	2.  With regard to the Zapata County meter numbers listed in the PCS Synergi database document that you showed me, which reflects all ENA-related purchase contracts from 1980-1995, you will double-check to make sure that there is no evidence of any purchase contract listing Enron Corp., Intratex or EGM as a counterparty.  If there is, you will research whether there was any evidence of actual purchase activity under any of these meters. With regard to the meters shown on that document, both "off-system" and "on-system", you will research who owned or operated them.

	3.  With regard to the Zapata County contracts in the new Global system, which shows all ENA-related purchase, sale or transportation contracts from 1999 forward, you will research the contracts that do appear to show ENA as a counter-party for actual purchase activity and at what meters.  Also, since the report you drew up does not show meter numbers, you will drill down for those as well, and see if there are any meters in addition to those shown in the PCS Synergi document.  If there are, you will research the identity of those as well.

	Please keep me closely advised.

	Britt
