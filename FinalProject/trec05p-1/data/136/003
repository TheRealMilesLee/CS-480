i was planning a meeting in portland to discuss a couple of new deals and i would need to have 3 people (inluding me) fly out there next week.  the only fares are around $2k.  given the new expense policy, i wanted to see if you would have any problems with that.  i am typically very frugal with travel and always assess the cost-effectiveness.  the deals have about $1m value and will be more likely to close in person.  i need to know by end of today.  thanks.

i also have a 1-sheet strategy brief that i wanted to go over w/ you & mike earlier.  we should come back to that now.
