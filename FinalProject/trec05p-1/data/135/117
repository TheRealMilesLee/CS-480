Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me today. I enjoyed our
visit and remain very interested in the opportunity at El Paso. I
believe I can make a difference and build a merchant regulatory function
that will add value and be respected in the industry. Feel free to call
Steve Kean at 713-853-1586. I'd also be happy to give you some
additional names. Thanks again.
