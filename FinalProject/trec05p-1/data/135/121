Bill,

As mentioned during our conference call this morning, we have significant
Lend and Park activity with ENA (and some activity with Enron Energy
Services).  Potential stressed net exposure peaks at $ 12.4 million in April
' 02.

Due to the recent downgrades of Enron Corp.'s (Guarantor of ENA's
obligations to PG&E) senior unsecured debt rating to BBB- by S&P and other
rating agencies, we respectfully request that Enron North America provide
PG&E with a Standby Irrevocable Letter of Credit in the amount of $ 6.5
million expiring no earlier than October 30, 2002.  This request is made
under the provisions of PG&E's Gas Rule 25 (Gas Services-Customer
Creditworthiness and Payment Terms).

I would appreciate your letting me know when the L/C will be issued.  Thanks



Jack Foley
