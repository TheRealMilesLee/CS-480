ATTN:YOU CONTRACTOR

Dear Sir,

Sequel to the secretive arrangement in regards of the shipment of your 
contract sum, I wish to inform you that all necessary modalities have been 
automatically concluded and have left Nigeria to London via your Country 
today by Express Cargo Flight.

Note carefully the content of the crate is "MONEY" but I did not disclose it 
to the Courier Services as Money, rather I informed them that the crate 
contain Vital "DIPLOMATIC DOCUMENTS" belonging to my client (that’s you).
Furthermore, the weight of the consignment is 90kg but I manage to pay 45kg,
which cost US$9,000.00. On no account should you disclose the content of the 
crate with the Diplomatic Courier Services for fear of betrayal. So do not 
allow them to know that the content is money.

In the meantime, contact the Global Trust Dipomatic Courier Services to the 
Attn. Edy Smithkline on Tel: 44-77-46065722 or Email 
:smith@global-trust-courier.net  to know the actual situation with the 
consignment and also give them your address where the consignment will be 
delivered and then get back to me as soon as possible so that I can give you 
the shipment document.
Meanwhile, I will be coming over to your country immediately the consignment 
arrives in your Country for my 10% share.

Please update me as you contact the Global Trust Diplomatic Courier Services 
for more details you may need from me.

Congrats and remain blessed.
Best Regards,

Yours faithfully,
Dr. PETER BELLO
