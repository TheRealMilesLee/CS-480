I'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play PAINTBALL in the next few weeks.  This would obviously not be sponsored by Enron b/c Enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now.

So let me know if you would be interested and, if so, when you would be available to go.   The cost should be around $30-40 a person.

Please forward to anyone I have forgotten or might be interested.


-Eric
