Subject: [Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Denver RB Craziness
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hi Folks,

As if the Denver RB situation wasn't already goofy enough with Terrell Davis
getting close to being ready, ESPN's John Clayton is now reporting that
Olandis Gary could get the start this week in an effort to shake the offense
up.

Anderson did have a fumble Sunday which drew the ire of Shanahan.

It might be worth making a move for Gary in your league if you can grab him
cheaply.   But I'm not excited yet.   More likely, you can use this info to
taunt the Gary / Davis / Anderson owners in your league...

More as we hear it.

Joe
