To all:
I have attached a document giving details on the Sloan Leadership Conference
this Saturday, October 27.  I have also attached a map of the MIT Sloan
campus.

The Finance panel, in which Mr. Vince Kaminski will participate, will be
held from 1:15 - 2:30 in the afternoon.  The room location will be given at
registration.  A full agenda is included in the document.

I look forward to meeting with you all!  If you have any questions, please
do not hesitate to contact me.  I have included my mobile number in case you
need to reach me on the conference day.

Thanks,
