Michelle,

When you were in d.c., i looked at an employment contract that contained a clause listing disability as a basis for termination of our employement agreements.  i had some concerns about the language, and called kriste to check on the clause.  my suggestion was to use language stating that the contract would terminate if the employee could not perform the essential functions of the job, with or without a reasonable accommodation.  kriste, asked me to send her the language.  

i haven't done so yet; you asked me to hold off sending her language until we update our form contracts.  

have you had twanda make the changes to the employment contract form?  did the changes include that language?  and, if so, can T send it to kriste, if she hasn't already?
