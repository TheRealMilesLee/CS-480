Yeah.  Guess we do have to worry about that.   I was thinking it would apply to our receivable, not the total under collection, but that would not make sense.  Maybe the other idea will work.  It gets difficult to continue to think of ways around some of these problems.  Thanks,
Wanda

Do we run the risk of them saying, Enron, on average your customers represented 5% of the load, therefore you owe us 5% of the undercollection, or $3B * 0.05 = $150M?  That's my biggest concern.  Thoughts?

What do you think about the % of load argument?  This is Sue's e-mail.
