Pool Update:

Here's where things stand:

The pool will continue.  I'm still waiting to here back from Dave Heinemen,
Nathan Dougherty and Mark Hull to find out what they want to do.  For those
that responded so promptly....Thank you.   I'll be in Houston tomorrow and
out of the office Thursday.  Please send me your pick by 10:00 am Friday.  


Alex Woodruff and Jerry Padilla have elected to collect their money now.
You'll receive your money when Bob resumes his "Pool Director" chair next
week.  

Enjoy your day!
Larry Bevans
