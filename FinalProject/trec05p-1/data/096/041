Mr. Martin L. Cuilla
Trader
Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

Dear Mr. Cuilla:

Recently, there has been a lot of discussion and confusion on the
direction of the distributed energy (DE) industry. With the summer stock
price collapse and slow market development, many DE stakeholders are
re-thinking their strategies. Cambridge Energy Research Associates
(CERA) is as well.

In an effort to provide you with the most up-to-date, valued
information, CERA is asking each member of our Distributed Energy
Advisory Service to complete a brief survey so that we may better serve
you.  The survey can be found at the following link:
http://www.cera.com/survey/distributed 

This survey is anonymous and all comments are welcome. We plan to
present and discuss the results at our Executive Retreat in Santa Fe,
New Mexico, December 5-7, 2001.

Thank you for your time and we appreciate your input.

Sincerely,

Steven Taub
Director, Distributed Energy
