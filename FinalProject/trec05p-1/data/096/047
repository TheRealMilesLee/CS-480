"Creating a Vibrant Retail Electricity Market" 
Tuesday, October 30, 2001, at 10 am (MST), 12 noon (EST)
What key findings have marketing practitioners and restructuring architects gleaned from retail energy markets that have opened to date? If currently closed markets are to open successfully, what critical elements must be in place? Which stumbling blocks need to be removed? E Source has convened a panel of experienced players to distill what can be learned from recently opened markets and offer advice for incorporating these lessons into your strategic and marketing planning. The panel will include:

"Is it Possible to Restructure Retail Electric Markets?"
Tuesday, November 6, 2001, at 10 am (MST), 12 Noon (EST)
The catastrophic failure of California's restructuring efforts, coupled with extremely low switching rates in overseas and various U.S. state markets, raises anew the debate over whether it is even possible to restructure retail electric markets. Is there something fundamentally different about electric markets that render them impossible to open? Over the past quarter-century, numerous once-regulated industries, such as financial services, airlines, and telecommunications, have been successfully restructured. Why is electricity an outlier? Will it change?
Two distinguished industry analysts, Ken Malloy, CEO of the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets and publisher of the RED Index, and Dr. Mark Cooper, Director of Research for Consumer Federation of America, will debate two interrelated propositions: 
1. All retail customers should be required to choose a new energy supplier.
2. Non-commodity products--such as demand-side management, distributed generation, green power, and combined heat and power--will penetrate faster and more deeply in open retail markets than they would under the continuation of traditional regulation.
