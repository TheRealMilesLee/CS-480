> Mud Puddles and Dandelions 
> 
> When I look at a patch of dandelions, I see a bunch of weeds that are 
> going to take over my yard. My kids see flowers for Mom and blowing 
>  white fluff you can wish on. 
> 
> When I look at an old drunk and he smiles at me, I see a smelly, dirty 
> person who probably wants money and I look away. My kids see 
> someone smiling at them and they smile back. 
> 
> When I hear music I love, I know I can't carry a tune and don't have 
> much rhythm so I sit self-consciously and listen. My kids feel the beat 
> and move to it. They sing out the words. If they don't know them, they 
> make up their own. 
> 
> When I feel wind on my face, I brace myself against it. I feel it messing 
> up my hair and pulling me back when I walk. My kids close  their eyes, 
> spread their arms and fly with it, until they fall to the  ground 
laughing. 
> 
> When I pray, I say thee and thou and grant me this, give me that. My 
> kids say, "Hi God! Thanks for my toys and my friends. Please keep 
> the bad dreams away tonight.  Sorry, I don't want to go to Heaven 
> yet. I would miss my Mommy and Daddy." 
> 
> When I see a mud puddle I step around it. I see muddy shoes and 
> dirty carpets. My kids sit in it. They see dams to build, rivers to 
> cross and worms to play with. 
>
