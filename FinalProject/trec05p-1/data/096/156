>On October 17, 2001 a specimen of powder was collected from the mail 
>processing area of the Haas School of Business and sent to the California 
>Department of Health Services laboratory for testing. The final results of 
>the testing done on this powder revealed no evidence of any harmful 
>substance. As a result, we conclude that there is no health concern 
>whatsoever and specifically, no anthrax spores were detected. As with most 
>unknown materials submitted for analysis, the actual identity of the 
>material may never be definitively determined.
>
>The recent events around the country have generated a lot of 
>understandable anxiety, but to date, there have been no confirmed cases of 
>anthrax in the State of California.  As with this incident, strong 
>teamwork, continued vigilance tempered with common sense will be important 
>as we face the challenges of the future.
