 	  	 Dear Mike,

On Wednesday, we'll continue our live coverage of the 18th World Energy Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina. International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale will bring us reports and interviews throughout the day. 

Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says they'll continue to bring us the very latest on energy legislation and how it's progressing. The bureau will also have updates on the anthrax scare in Washington. Congressional office buildings were closed on Tuesday, but there's a possibility some could reopen as soon as Wednesday. 

The Washington bureau will also cover Wednesday's FERC meeting as commissioners meet for the first time since the end of the weeklong workshop on Regional Transmission Organizations. Peter says new proposals for developing RTOs in the Northeast and Southeast are among the issues on the FERC's agenda. 

Dyonyx CEO Fred Pratt will talk with the Houston bureau about how companies can make current technologies work better for them. Dyonyx is a privately held information technology and management-consulting firm. Join us for the Pratt interview from the Houston bureau on Wednesday. 

We'll also get a Texas PUC update on Wednesday. ENL's Gale Smith says we'll find out what electric providers are doing to increase security and what the Texas PUC is doing to monitor emergency preparedness in Texas. Be sure to catch all this from the Houston bureau tomorrow. 

California Power Authority Chairman S. David Freeman gives a reflective look back at the state's energy crunch from the West Coast bureau Wednesday. Freeman also talks about how the state plans to stay out of the headlines in the future. 

West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station will go ahead with plans to set off its 49 sirens on Wednesday to make sure warning systems are operational. Kym says they will continue the test despite their concerns of a jittery public in light of recent terrorist attacks. 

Video Library Update: If you happened to miss it, check out ENL's interview with Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM). Sen. Bingaman discussed the status of energy legislation in the Senate and the anthrax threat in Washington. 

Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. 

Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.
