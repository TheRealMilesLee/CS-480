FYI.  I ran into Bryson last Friday.  He told me (insisted, in fact) that Edison was paying everyone in February.  He told me (insisted, again) that they would have all necessary approvals from the PUC in the next several weeks.  He said that once those approvals are in place, they'll quickly get financing in place to ensure a February payment date--for everyone.  I said that was great news but that the market didn't seem quite as certain.  He was pretty firm.  He also said that it was too late for anyone to take them into bankruptcy involuntarily, that a judge wouldn't go for it. 

Did you know if Lay every talk to Bryson?

Best,
Jeff
