Gerald, a couple of comments...
1) Pricing does not change until 1/102, nor do other provisions like the keep whole, The way you have the contracts drafted, it is as if we have new terms beginning now. I think the producers will object to this and think we are trying to put something over on them now. Can we make the new contracts effective 1/1/02?

2) Under Art. 2 Contract price....I have a questions about the 80% of "First of the Month Nomination"...what about the 5% swing they get...Shouldn't it be 80% of actuals, subject to the keep whole? Maybe I am the one confused, but could you please call me to discuss. Thanks.

Attached are the two contracts which will replace the single original, as we discussed.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions. Thanks.
