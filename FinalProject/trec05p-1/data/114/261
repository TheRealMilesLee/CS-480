Jeff --

First of all, I wanted to thank you for your positive comments to Karen about my work on behalf of Enron.  She asked me to stay on board on an hourly, as-needed basis while they try to figure out what will happen next year.  Although I don't expect much work, it's certainly better than being cut out completely and she mentioned that you had appreciated my help during the contempt negotiations.  

I don't envy Karen for her job at the moment.  I've been getting the clips and Houston doesn't look like a fun place to be right now.  I also don't think they're planning too far in advance.  Yikes!

I've got a couple of CPUC questions for you.  What's the process for making a presentation in regard to either a specific case on the agenda?  Is it simply a matter of being present during a public hearing, or is there a list of witnesses/commentors that you have to get on?  The reason I ask is that I've been approached by a potential client regarding some telecommunications/broadband issues, with an appearance at the CPUC as a news hook.

How far in advance is the meeting agenda set?  I noticed that a meeting is scheduled for Nov. 29, but an agenda was not available on the Web site.  Is it likely that it is still being compiled?  How do you get on the agenda?

Any light you can shed on this for me would be appreciated.  I don't know if this project is going to come through or not, but I'm not sure my possible client is any better versed on CPUC procedures than I am.  I figure at least one of us should know what we're talking about.

Thanks!  You might give me a heads up if there's anything on one of the upcoming Wednesday calls that you'd like me to comment on.  Since I'm basically on call, I probably won't dial in unless someone gives me a reason.

Best,
Ken
