I'll defer to Jim on this one.  Given the time and energy that Bev has spent on this one, I think it's important to have Jim call her as well and simply say how sorry he is that he can't attend.  It's all relationships.

Under the circumstances, I am leaning toward cancelling (I was originally only going to participate on Monday anyway, and Sue hadn't planned on attending. Neither Rick nor Jim can attend.)  If there's a compelling reason that you think I should attend, let me know.  Otherwise I'll let Bev know that we'll take a rain check on this one.

Best,
Jeff
