Protocall Technologies Incorporated_OTCBB:PCLI is the

flagship SoftwareToGo® electronic delivery system is the
industry's standard for on-site production of brand name
software CDs, for both traditional and Web retailers.

management and electronic merchandising services for

++ NEWS ++

Protocall Technologies Inc. (PCLI) announced yesterday that
its unique SoftwareToGo kiosk delivery system has now been
installed at 25 CompUSA locations in 3 major market regions. 

The news was included in an announcement by the company
yesterday of an additional software distribution agreement
with Executive Software, a company that is a dominant player
in software solutions for the disk defragmentation market. 

The SoftwareToGo system is a new approach to selling
software, allowing customers to review software features
and to then purchase shrink-wrapped software, complete with
manufacturer's Certificate of Authenticity, directly from a
software display and delivery kiosk within the CompUSA store. 

SoftwareToGo allows retailers to offer thousands of software
titles for sale in a 15 sq. ft. area that would otherwise
take up 5,000 sq. ft. of retail selling space.
