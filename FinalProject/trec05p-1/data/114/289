Internet Daily 
for Thursday, November 1, 2001
by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com


Ecommerce crawls back from Sept. 11
 


Renewed interest in travel is helping online shopping activity 
reach a pace not seen since the terrorist attacks of September.

Hotwire.com, a discount travel service, said it has registered 1 
million new users since the tragedy. Daily sales and 
transactions are equal to those of the weeks prior to Sept. 11, 
said Hotwire president Karl Peterson.

ComScore Networks reported similar results in its weekly survey 
of Internet users' transaction data. Travel category product 
sales were 6% below pre-attack levels, the Reston, Va., research 
firm said. During the week ending Oct. 28, total domestic 
ecommerce sales were $974 million, 2% below the average for five 
weeks prior to Sept. 11. Don Hess, ComScore vice president, 
said, "We suspect the needle is starting to move in holiday 
shopping, perhaps earlier than the industry might expect."

Internet World rescheduled to December

The ninth annual Internet World conference will be held Dec. 
10-14 at the Jacob Javits Convention Center in New York City. 
The show was originally planned for Oct. 1-5. Organizer Penton 
Media  said the majority of exhibitors and speakers set for 
October have reconfirmed for the December event. Internet World 
will be held simultaneously with another show, Streaming Media 
East 2001. Keynote speakers at the shows will include AOL Time 
Warner  co-COO Bob Pittman, Real Networks  founder Rob Glaser, 
and Playboy Enterprises  chairman and CEO Christie Hefner.

High-speed Net accessible to 75%

Broadband Internet access will be available to three-quarters of 
U.S. households by the end of the year, according to market 
researcher Yankee Group. That is an increase from 60% at the end 
of 2000. Cable modem service will pass 66% of homes compared to 
45% available for digital subscriber line service. "Success will 
increasingly be driven by the network operators' ability to 
lower the cost of hook-ups," said Michael Goodman, a senior 
analyst. He estimated that cable companies spend an average of 
$360 for equipment to support a broadband subscriber. He cited 
this as a reason why cable companies, such as ComCast , are 
aggressively selling self-install cable modems through retailers 
such as Circuit City  and Best Buy.
