Attached is the format that Tim Proffitt's team would like to see the data presented in.  This is the information previously requested in Chris Heron's email yesterday and setting the Thursday noon deadline. The file shown below is physical gas; their goal is to show the data at a business unit level by ultimate parent; then by operating company level by ultimate parent; i.e., ENA,EGM,EIM,; and then finally at an Enron corp level by ultimate parent.  If you have questions about file format please call me at extension 37962.  Thanks to all of you for your hard work.

Leslie
