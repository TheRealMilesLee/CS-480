All-

As requested by Mary Cook, I am providing the list of counterparties with whom I am working on netting arrangements.  They are as follows:

ConAgra-		Under review by credit (margining and netting requested in their draft)
Conoco- 		Verbally agreed, awaiting hard copy from Conoco (only payment netting)
Crown Central-		Under review by legal (only payment netting requested in their draft)
Morgan Stanley- 	Executed via facsimile (only close-out netting)
Sunoco-		Under review by legal (only payment netting requested in their draft)
Valero-			Under review by legal (only for payment netting requested in their draft)

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.

John

Before you leave today or first thing in the morning, please advise Bradford, Rohauer and Kitchen by email of the status of the particular master netting agreements on which you are working.  Barbara Gray is coordinating the release of the gas receivable financing so that we can execute the netting agreements and she will advise as and when finalized.  As previously noted today, the power receivable financing will be released as we sign the netting agreements on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis.
