Dear Ken,

I tried to send this as a reply to both you and the Chairman of the Board but it came back. Your admin said to just mail it directly to you. I think you will be pleased (something you might need to feel right now?) at what I have to say...

This is an amazing letter and I am so happy that Mr. White stands behind us! 

I was born and raised in Houston and worked in Houston through the good times and the bad. I agree wholeheartedly with his article and trust that our company is working hard to make things right. Whether I am laid off or allowed to stay this year, I will always stand behind this company!  I worked 10 years at HL&P as an electrical field engineer from 1977 to 1987--through gas lines and recessions and all kinds of internal problems. I know what it's like to feel belittled because the media makes such a ruckus about company policies that we had to paint over the HL&P bullet logo on our company cars and say that we worked for Houston Industries, not Houston Lighting and Power. Shoot, I even had to face a double-barrel shotgun because I had on a company uniform with HL&P on it!  Well, we made it through it and now HL&P is Reliant Energy, so restoration is always possible. I worked side-by-side with those committed Enron employees (most I had never met) helping to clean mud-laden homes from the tropical storm this year, and I was so proud to say to my friends that Enron allowed it's employees to be a part of the community clean-up. My daughter is a senior who volunteered her time during Earth Day festivities here and met other young, innovative people who became her new friends. I want her to keep this positive attitude about our company. I've worked for DuPont, Xerox and Baroid, MCI and Worldcom, and Lyondell and other corporate giants in the past 10 years. Not one ever offered the kind of monetary help (not to mention excellent benefits and raises) that Enron always provides. 

I just want to say, Ken, keep up the good work!  I'm proud to be an Enron employee, and yes, even an EBS employee!!

Sincerely,
Linda Faircloth

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.
