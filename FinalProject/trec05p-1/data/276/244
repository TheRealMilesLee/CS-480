FROM: MR. Mr. Samuel Moyo
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
DOMICILLIARY ACCOUNTS DEPT.
ABSA BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA 
JOHANNESBURG.

Dear,

First, I have to introduce myself.   My name is Mr. Mr. Samuel Moyo, an executive director with the ABSA BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA. I came to know you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money  to foreign bank account.

The proposal is this -  An American, CARL J. HACKSON, an Gold Merchant / Contractors with the Federal Government of , died of an undisclosed illness five years ago. Before his death, he was one of our most valuable customers.  

He left  a balance of USD$26,233,000.00 (Twenty Six Million, Two Hundred and Thirty three thousand Dollars only).  This said sum of money can only be claimed by Mr. Hackson's wife, children or Next of  Kin.  Efforts make by the Bank to get in touch with any member of his family have proved abortive.  Mr. Hackson left no WILL nor Instructions and there is no trace that he had wife and kids, so his money remains in the vault of our bank. 

For three years, I have personally monitored this account and now feel that this is the time to move the whole fund into a foreign bank account.  Therefore, I and my trusted colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand as next of kin to Late Carl J. Hackson so that the funds (USD$26,233,000.00) be paid into your  account as next of  kin.  

Be assured that all documents and proves to enable you get this fund will carefully worked out and I guarantee you a risk free involvement.  You will get a negotiable percentage  of the total sum for your assistance.  We shall map out a percentage of this money to take care of minor expenses that could arise in the cause of this transaction.

Please note, that I and my colleagues would resigned our positions quietly in the bank if this transaction is successful.  We put all our hope and the success of  this transaction in you, I hope you will not take undue advantage of us.

If you are interested in this proposal, get back to me through my email address (samuelmoyo1001@hotmail.com). Furthermore, you must include your private tel/fax/mobile for easier communications and confidentiality.

Regards,

Mr. Samuel Moyo (+277359933635)
