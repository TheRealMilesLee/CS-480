on North America, the opportunity for security services is worldwide.

worldwide demand for information security products and services is set 
to 
eclipse $46B by 2OO5.

market 
by delivering professional services, security products, security 
training, 
and managed security services. In pursuit of this objective, Vinoble

full

integrated delivery solutions, Vinoble will help organizations protect 
key 
assets including persons, property, information, brand, and reputation.
