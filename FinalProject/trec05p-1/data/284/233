Subject: attention! hidden college camera Amy
X-Mailer: KMail [version 1.0.28]

These are real amateurs who have webcams on their
computers in their dorm rooms! This is not one of those
porn sites with professional girls who get paid to do this
in front of the camera, these are the average girls next door, 
at college, trying to make money and meet guys!

It wont take you more then 1 minute to just check this out
what are you waiting for?
