Dear Friend.

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I
believe everyone will die someday.

My name is Shadak Shari, a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have
been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of
medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to
live, according to medical experts.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really
cared for anyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am very
rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only
focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But
now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than
just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I
would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now
that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property
and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a
few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have
decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be
one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed
money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and
Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do
this myself anymore.

I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and
distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in
Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to
themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to
be contended with what I have left for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit
of seven million dollars $7,000,000,that I have with a
finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect
this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.

I have set aside 10% for you for your time and patience.please send
a reply through this email address(shadakshari005@telkom.net) with
your full contact information for more private and confidential 
communication.

God be with you.

Shadak Shari
