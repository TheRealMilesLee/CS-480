FROM  MR IBRAHIM BARUK
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A)
OUAGADOUGOU,BURKINA FASO
PRIVATE TEL:00226 78 81 75 32.
DEAR FRIEND,

I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foriegn remittance department 
of Bank Of Africa (B.O.A). In my department we discovered an abandoned sum 
of US$20.5 (Twenty million
five hundred thousand US dolloars) in an account that belongs to one of our 
foriegn customer who died along with his entire family in a plane crash that 
happened in Kenya, East Africa.
Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt
that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the 
plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

Please I want you to visit the website below for more information about the 
Plane Crash and the Deceased DR. GEORGE W. BRUMLEY AND HIS FAMILY: 
<http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/20/kenya.crash/index.html>

It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business 
proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation 
to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is 
coming for it and I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as 
unclaimed bill. I agree that 40% of this money will be for you as a foreign 
partner, in
respect to the provision of a foriegn account, and 60% would be for me, 
There after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the 
percentage indicated.

Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, 
you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased 
indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone 
and fax number for easy and effective communication and location wherein the 
money will be remitted. Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you 
by fax or email the text of the application to fill and send to the bank. I 
will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% Risk 
free and you should keep this transaction (TOP SECRET) and this transaction 
will only take us 14 banking days in the exceptance of this proposal because 
as a banker, I know what to do and move the fund into your account without 
any delay and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required 
arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me as soon 
as you receive this letter .
Yours faithfully.
MR IBRAHIM BARUK
Bill & Exchange Manager,
BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A)
