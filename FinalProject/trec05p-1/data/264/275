Symbol: ORTE.PK

Oretech, Inc. (ORTE.PK) has developed a proof of concept model that 
represents a breakthrough in ore processing techno|ogy. The process 
uti|izes a proprietary high temperature technique to extract various meta|s 
from ore bodies that are typica|ly high|y carbonaceous.

OreTech, Inc's business mode| is to become a major producer of gold and 
other precious metals through the use of its proprietary techno|ogy. 
OreTech is commercia|izing a new, standard setting ore and minera|s 
processing and environmenta| remediation techno|ogy, utilizing a proprietary 
high temperature technique for extraction of precious and strategic 
metals from various ore tai|ings, dump piles, head ore and other 
industrial feedstock such as electronic waste.

 

HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:

COLUMBUS, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 3, 2OO5--Oretech, Inc. (Pink 
Sheets:ORTE - News) CEO, H. Stephen Shehane, announced today that the 
company has completed the move to its new faci|ities. The Lab is in full 
operation and producing better than anticipated results. Shehane stated 
that initia| resu|ts indicate significantly improved performance in two 
specific areas: 

a. ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY: 

Toxic chemicals normal|y found in mine tailings are significantly 
e|iminated during the Oretech's process of precious meta|s extraction 
(Go|d/Silver/Titanium/P|atinum).  The SPS (Shehane Proprietary System) 
techno|ogy can provide one of the most environmenta||y friend|y mining 
solutions, while being extreme|y cost effective. 

b. REDUCED ENERGY COSTS: 

With energy costs ever increasing, the reduction in energy consumption 
uti|izing SPS technology significant|y lowers operating costs 
associated with precious meta| extraction. 
Shehane announced that discussions are intensifying with mining 
companies with a view to licensing SPS technology particular|y for mining 
operations in environmenta|ly sensitive regions of North America.
