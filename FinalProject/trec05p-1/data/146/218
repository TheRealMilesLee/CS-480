hi. I saw your profile and you seem like an interesting person. Take a look at mine and email back if you want to talk more.

The following is my profile text:

Some people would describe me as "having a lot of energy," friendly, outgoing, intuitive and kind. I am physically fit, but not perfect. I enjoy working out by going to the gym, hiking, mountain biking and snowshoeing. I am in the Consulting sales and management area. For fun I love to hang out with my friends and family, go on spontaneous adventurous trips, go to parties, read, hike and attend sporting events. The types of music that move me are songs that actually have something to say about life and romantic, classical music. I am the happiest when I'm healthy and everything is going great. I am happy when I'm with my family and friends and the person that I am with. I am the most at peace when I am away from noise and surrounded by beauty. What I have done that makes me the proudest of myself is achieving things that I thought I never could. If I could invite any 5 people to dinner it would be my parents, my best friend, the person that I'm in love with and my favorite cousin. My idea of a perfect date is having a nice dinner and staying up all night talking. I am looking for someone who is easy to talk to, non-judgemental, and who enjoys life to the fullest. I am not the type of person who likes to meet people in a bar setting. I am looking for someone who makes me laugh and appreciates who I am.
