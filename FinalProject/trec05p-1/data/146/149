<table border=0 width="100%" cellpadding="8"  cellpadding="8"><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">Attn:sir/madam,<BR>CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PLAN <BR>&nbsp;<BR>I humbly wish to seek your assistance in a matter thatis very important and needs utmost trust and confidence. I am Mr.Joe Ibekwe, a business consultant and close confidant of one of Nigeria&#8217;s most powerful family. The wife of top government official and an oil royalist who served in the past military regime in Nigeria wishes to move out of Nigeria the sum of US$24.7 million. She wishes to invest the aforementioned sum in viable investment oversea. <BR>&nbsp;For obvious reasons, my client does not wish to place this fund with established financial institution in the family&#8217;s name for security reason. It is her desire that the deal is handled as quietly as possible without possibility of any leakage to the public or Government as they have suffered a great lost in the past. She has therefore empowered and instructed me to look for a reliable foreigner who can arrange and receive the money in his or her account oversea and assist to invest the fund properly for the family. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>If you agree to act as a fund manager for my client and her family, I shall arrange to release the sum of US$24.7 Million to you if you meet my requirement and upon a favourable response from you. I shall let you know how you will receive it. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Your commission shall be&nbsp; payment of 40% of the total sum. And annual 10% of the after tax returns on investment for the first five years. Therefore, the terms shall be varied. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Be informed that arrangements have been made for you to receive the fund in abroad, so you must be ready to travel to abroad where you will sign the necessary documents for the release of the fund to your designated bank account. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>If you are capable and willing to participate in this <BR>transaction, reach me by this&nbsp; e-mail <A href="mailto:joeibekwe37@volcanomail.com">joeibekwe37@volcanomail.com</A> or&nbsp; as stated above. In any case, please keep it tight secret. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Goodbye and GOD bless. As I anxiously await your <BR>soonest positive response. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Best regards. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Mr.Joe Ibekwe.</td></tr></table>
