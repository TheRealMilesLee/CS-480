Hi Michelle, 
Do you have any suggestions so that I can move forward in finalizing the data based on our discussion of having Jeanerette run the numbers?

Kelly, 
A part of the Management Committee presentation, we will need the DATA as part of 'business case'.  Michelle Cash and I have discussed using Jeanerette to calculate the standard deviations.  I was hoping to get the clearance from Mary Joyce to prepare and provide the data.  As you can see, from the original note of Oct. 8th I am at a standstill and am positive I cannot get this information turned around, analyzed and ready as a part of the presentation by Friday noon, per your request.

So I will prepare a proposed presentation without the data.  I hope to get this resolved shortly.   Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.  That would be great.  Do you think it can be this week because we are trying to get a presentation ready for Mr. Lay.

Good Morning Andrea:

Please let me know I would be glad to assist.

Mary/Michelle, 
Would it be possible for us to meet today to discuss the HR data needed to to run the standard deviations.  All other data has been prepared to submit to Jeanerette. 

Thanks.

Mary, 
We are currently in the process of doing diversity analysis with the Mid-Year 2001 PRC data.  We will also have the Jeanerette group run the standard deviations.  Since I have taken on the EEO/AAP responsibility, Michelle and I agree that the HR data needs to be incorporated into the analysis and will need your approval for me to get access to the information.   Please let me know what I need to do to get clearance.  Our target is to get the information ready by Thursday but will need at least a day to consolidate the information.    

Thanks. ay
