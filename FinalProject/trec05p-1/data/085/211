Alan spoke to Belden - he doesn't want to limit our involvement to TFG.  We can still join w/ TFG's comments/oral statements, though.

RE: Docket EL01-68-000  Investigation of Wholesale Rates of Public Utility Sellers of Energy and Ancillary Services in the Western Systems Coordinating Council.
 
Dear Mr. Boergers: 
 
Enron Power Marketing Inc. (EPMI) respectfully requests the opportunity to make a statement during the October 29, 2001 technical conference in the above-referenced proceeding.  EPMI would appreciate the opportunity to allow the following representative to make a statement on its behalf:

G. Alan Comnes, 
Director, Government Affairs 
Enron Corp. 
121 SW Salmon Street 
Portland, OR 97204 
email: AComnes@enron.com 
telephone: 503-464-8129 

EPMI operates as a marketer of electric power and natural gas in markets throughout the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC).  EPMI has been an active participant in this and related dockets and has submitted written comments pertaining to Westwide price mitigation on both May 7, 2001and August 20, 2001. In addition to identifying problems created by continued price mitigation in the WSCC, EPMI will identify problems that will be created if the Commission were to inconsistently apply price mitigation in the WSCC or make rule changes that create further uncertainty in the marketplace.   Because of EPMI's unique position as a power marketer that operates throughout the WSCC, it has a unique perspective to provide the Commission and workshop participants.

A letter making the same request, along with Mr. Comnes' credentials, will be filed with the Commission tomorrow.  If you have any questions regarding this matter, please contact me at 713-853-3180.  

Sincerely, 

Robert J. Frank
