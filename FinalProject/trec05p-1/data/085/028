Jeff,

Following is the approximate cost of materials for the deck. Included in
the price is approx. $1200.00 for 2x6 redwood decking.

materials cost  $ 3190.00

I firgured to use 4x4 redwood posts to support the eventual trellace, as
they look better than 'direct burial, DB' pressure treated. The redwood
decking runs $ 1.20/ lin. ft., which is a good price, if you want me to
order this at the same time let me know, I can have it all delivered, as
discussed. Will you be installing the deck as discussed?

We are trying to finish up a job we've been at for sometine but the
owner keeps adding more. So I'm about two weeks out from getting after
your project. Can you fax me a map to your place from the ridge top,
707-785-2926.

Let me know if this will work.

Best regards,

Jim D.
