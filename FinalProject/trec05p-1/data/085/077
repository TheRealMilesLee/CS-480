Community Leaders & Members,
 
This year's significant city action impacting our area is the Prevailing Lot Size Amendment.
 
A Planning Commission Public Hearing will be held this Thursday (tomorrow) at 2:30pm at the City Hall Annex Council Chambers, 900 Bagby. The building behind & west of City Hall. (City Hall is the building w/ the clock and the long pond/pool in front)  
 
This is the City's response to our need for protection and preservation of neighborhood integrity and allow the option for self determination by areas within communities. It is important for all of the Neartown/Montrose area
 
What's this about? The long answer....Scroll down to the Proposed Prevailing Lot Size Amendment at www.ci.houston.tx.us/departme/planning/Devp_rel.htm <http://www.ci.houston.tx.us/departme/planning/Devp_rel.htm>.
 
The short answer....residents on both sides of a block can petition the City to establish a "prevailing lot size", thereby inhibiting, if not discouraging, new development from reducing or subdividing a single lot to less than the established lot size. 
 
For instance, if the established lot size for a particular block is 50 ft x 100 ft, a townhouse builder could not buy a lot within that block to replat/subdivide the lot into two 25 ft x 100 ft lot for a townhouse on each lot.
 
Yes, there's lots of details, and like the existing protection on establishing front building setback lines, this prevailing Lot Size Amendment can help to maintain neighborhood integrity in areas without deed restrictions and in deed restricted areas that do not address established lot sizes.
 
I need your presence tomorrow to show the community support for this proposal. If this doesn't get out of the Planning Commission, it'll never get to City Council to become an ordinance amendment. This is that part of the process where we need to be there to fill the room.
 
Thanks
