	Envoy: GMC's Bold New SUV	  	 
The GMC Envoy is one of the nicest surprises of the 2002 model year. It represents a comprehensive improvement over its Jimmy predecessor, making it one of the most competitive mid-sized SUVs on the market. 

The fact that it is still "truck-based" - which essentially refers to the full-frame construction that makes its Yukon big brother such a beefy workhorse - does not mean that this SUV rides like a truck. Quite the contrary, the Envoy is smooth and refined in a way that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. Of course, the market in which the Envoy competes has become packed with excellent choices, with everyone from Acura to Mercury entering the fray. We drove an Envoy SLE 4WD to find out how it stacks up.
