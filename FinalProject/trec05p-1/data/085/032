Good afternoon Don,

I am sending you this email because I was looking at the Enron job postings on the intranet.  I believe that I have a candidate, that according to the job description for "power trader 24 hr. real time" (#108727), would be a great match for Enron.  I am attaching the resume of Jason Vogler.  I am currently an analyst in the Generation Investments group within ENA.  I have know Jason for most of my life.  He is a very sharp individual and I believe that he is an excellent example of Enron's core values.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions that you might have regarding Jason or his resume.  Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
