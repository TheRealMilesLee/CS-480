Hey fellas,
 I'm not going to make it this weekend.  Too many obligations here in WF and too far to go.  Wish I could be there.  Y'all will have a blast.  Give Dave my best.

Email me at work, I check that one more often:  thomas.lahey@sheppard.af.mil

Take care, God Bless,
 Tommy

I think Paintball looks good.  

I think we should just all go to the store together and split the cost
of the alcohol.  

Also, maybe play some poker at the house at night.  Maybe everybody can
bring a few dollars for a house game.    

No preference on the cake.

Oh, Tommy are you coming to the party???

Luke, please give my address to Bridgett:

201 S. Heights Blvd Apt 2017
Houston, tx 77007

LATER
Mike
