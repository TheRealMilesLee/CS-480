There was this one time, I was all fucked up in Corrales, no band camp to be 
found, and so we started all talking about this old band camp, and that´s 
when I started talking about about forgettaboutit.  Most people were not 
that farmiliar with forgettaboutit so I thout I´d tell them about "what are 
you talkin about", though it seems that most people are unaware of this 
terminology, so we started talking about ypu know, "what in the fuck are you 
taling about motherfucker, motherfucke." but that didn´t seem to go over 
that well.
