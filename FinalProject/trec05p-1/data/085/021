The Global Performance Management Team is gearing up to train both you and your business unit clients for the Year End Performance Management Process.  Please carefully read the information below:

HR COMMUNITY TRAINING
The Global Performance Management Team will be separating the HR training for YE2001 into two different courses during the week of October 29 - 31.  One course provides information on the YE2001 philosophy shift and deliverables while the second course will cover technical know-how on the PEP application.  Make sure you are in the know!

HR GENERALIST TRAINING will be customized by Business Unit to reflect the criteria that the BU and HR lead have determined will define the Performance Management Process for the respective BU and your attendance is required.

There is no action required on your part at this time to enroll in the Generalist class.  You will be sent information regarding your Business Unit's scheduled class under separate cover. If you are traveling to Houston for this class and you wish to combine your visit for PEP SYSTEM TRAINING, please let your Performance Management Advisor know.
 
PEP SYSTEM TRAINING will focus on technical know-how of the PEP system and is a hands-on class for those who are new to the application or wish to refresh their skills.  The system classes will be held on November 1 and  2.  To enroll in the system course, contact Allyson Zykorie now at x35210 to avoid disappointment!

EMPLOYEE TRAINING
Good news!  For the first time, the Global Performance Management Team has partnered with the Organizational Development and Training Team to design and deliver Performance Management training for employees and supervisors. These classes will be conducted in Houston, and it is anticipated that employee and supervisor training will occur in the week beginning November 5, 2001.  Online tutorials and training material will be available to all via the PEP home page.  

Your Performance Management Advisor will be contacting you to discuss the details of how the training courses will be rolled out to your clients with your assistance, and we ask that you please take some time to consider the best approach for your particular client groups in advance. 

There are significant changes to the Performance Management Process and a critical success factor of this process is the full inclusion and education of your client groups.  We will be asking HR Reps to make themselves available to attend these classes to help answer questions during each training session.

Thank you for your patience as we roll out the details of the process for YE2001.

Global Performance Management Team
