'The Stampede to Competition'
XENERGY'S 13th Executive Forum
February 26-27, 2002
The Four Seasons Hotel

_________________________________________________

There is still time to register for one of the most
important events to take place in the heart of the energy
community that has the world talking.

The Lone Star State has been labeled retail energy's last
hope. Texas' unique pro-competition policies and the
nation's biggest electric market combine to form the most
attractive market in the US. And the retailers are
stampeding into the state.

Two months after the market opens, the 'What's working,
what's not, and why', will be addressed in a lively,
interactive forum, led by industry leaders including:

- Hon. David Sibley, Former Senator, Texas Legislature
- Nick Fulford, Senior Vice President, Centrica
- Alan Raymond, Former President, Shell Energy Services
- Thomas Noel, CEO, Electric Reliability Council of Texas
- Jim Ajello, President, Reliant Energy Solutions
- Carol Biedrzycki, Executive Director, Texas ROSE
- Brett Perlman, Commissioner, Public Utility Commission of
Texas
and more.

Don't miss you chance to participate in this landmark event.
Space is limited so be sure to register today.

For the current agenda or to register on-line, go to
http://www.xenergy.com/austin or call Kerin Seward at
1-800-892-2006, x:256.
