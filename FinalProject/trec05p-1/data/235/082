From: Mrs. Sophia Dobet,

PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR GLORY OF LORD.

My name is Mrs. Sophia Dobet nationality of Cote D'lvoire. I am married to
Mr Egbert Dobet who worked with Cote D'lvoire embassy in SPAIN for
thirteen years before he died in terrorist attack carried out in America
Trade Center on September 11th, 2001.  May God receive his soul in perfect
peace, while asking the Lord to forgive those who perpetrated such evil
act on that day.

We married for eleven years without a child. Before he death we were both
born again Christians.  When my late husband was alive we deposited the
sum of $7.2Million (Seven Million two hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with
one of  the good Finance/Securities Companies in SPAIN. Presently, this
money is still with the  Finance/Securities S.A. in SPAIN.

Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three
months due to cancer problem.  Though what disturbs me most is my stroke.
Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to charity
purposes through a God's fearing individual that will utilize this money
the way I am going to instruct here in. I want such a person who will use
this fund to churches, mosques, orphanages, Research centres and widows
propagating the word of God and to ensure that the desires of God are
maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that
giventh.

I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this
money and my husband's relatives are not Christians and I don't want my
family hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a
situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the
reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I
know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the
Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall
hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard
because of my health because of the presence of my family relatives around
me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all
things are possible.

As soon as I receive your reply which will include your private phone &
fax numbers enabling me forward them to the Finance/Securities Company for
immediate transfer in your name, I shall give you the contact of the
Finance/Securities Company. I will also issue you a letter of authority
that will empower you as the new beneficiary of this fund.  I want you and
your place of worship no matter the religion to always pray for me because
the Lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy
Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit
and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in
your reply will give me room in sourcing for a God's fearing individual
for this same purpose.

I repeat, please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated
herein during your reply, and you should send me your full name, bank
account information and your private and fax numbers, so that I can
forward them to the  Finance/Securities Company immediately for the
process.

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.
Yours in Lord,
Mrs. Sophia Dobet.
