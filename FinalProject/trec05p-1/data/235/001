 << File: TW.model.r0.8.xls >> 
Here's the current rev on the tw model, with two key things that I need you all to review for me.  Please don't distribute to the large group until it is reviewed.

First, Lindy I have put the annual strip prices at the bottom of the "rolloff" tab.  Could you fill in the basis spread pricing that would result from this?

Second, Kevin and Rod - I had to give up on the FVA adjustments made in older models, I just couldn't get it.  Here's what I did; please let me know if there is something wrong with the analysis:
·	IBIT has annual FVA subtracted from it
·	Cash taxes are calculated using IBIT - Interest + FVA + tax/gaap depreciation adjustment
·	GAAP taxes use IBIT without FVA; deferred tax is GAAP-cash tax.
·	Net income is IBIT less GAAP taxes (therefore includes FVA amort)
·	Net Plant includes PP&E depreciation + FVA amortization
·	Retained earnings are standard - old RE + NI - Div's.

In the old model there were tax adjustments, pluses & minuses to equity, deferred credits, & current liabs that just didn't make sense to me.  I hope I've captured the theme of FVA (non-cash charge to NI, not deductible for tax) without the complication.  If not I can add it all back.

Best-
Davis
