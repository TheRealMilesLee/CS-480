Lindy Donoho (P# 505520) erroneously had 12/27-28 & 12/31 coded as vacation,
although she did not take them.

Therefore, please add 26 hours to her 2002 available vacation balance.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tracy  :o)

Please add 26 hours to Lindy Donoho, p505520 2002 vacation carryover.  26 hours were incorrectly coded last year as vacation, which was not taken.

Thanks in advance,
