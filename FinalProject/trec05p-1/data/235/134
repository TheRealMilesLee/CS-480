fyi:  One of Joe's twin grandchildren (I believe the twins were born around September or October) is currently in the hospital (about the 4th day).  Ashley is the baby who has had some breathing difficulty from time to time.  She has had a viral infection and due to the shallow breathing, the doctor is keeping her in the hospital.  The doctor had said that shallow breathing often progresses into SIDS.

Felt all of you would like to be aware -- presently Joe and Ruby have the other grandchild with them.  Will keep you informed but know Joe would appreciate your prayers.
