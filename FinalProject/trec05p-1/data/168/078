Louise,

Subject to final legal confirmation, it looks like I will need to terminate the Participation Agreement with BPUB by Dec. 31, or Enron could be obligated to proceed with building the HVDC tie. 

From what you know about the potential purchaser/s, Is there any point in my negotiating an extension of this date, or should I simply terminate?

Please advise.

Thanks,

Dave
