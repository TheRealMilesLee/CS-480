Eric,

Would you please prepare a memo regarding PB-KBB and the work that they are doing.  The memo should include scope of work, amount currently owed, amount to be spend from now until completion and the substance of the conversation that took place today.  I am not looking for a novel but rather something that is concise and can be taken to Don and the cash committee for approval.  I will take what you put together and add some information regarding the importance of getting approval for this contract given our need to complete Cavern #1 in order to satisfy our obligations under the Bridgeline agreements.  Thanks

Stuart
