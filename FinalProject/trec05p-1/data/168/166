Hello, Everyone -

Many of you have requested that we extend the time of the meeting at the Kingstad Conference Center next Wednesday, December 19, for review and discussion of the draft documents posted today.  The filing utilities agree that more time will be helpful for this review, so we will extend the meeting from 12:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.  We will begin at the usual time of 8:30 a.m.  I apologize for the inconvenience this may cause some of you who have already made plane reservations to leave earlier.  We are preparing a plan and schedule for further review and feedback opportunities after December 19, and we'll present this plan on December 19 as well.  In addition to your oral comments at the December 19 meeting, the filing utilities welcome any written comments on the drafts posted today that you'd like to make after the meeting.  We'll discuss Wednesday the most efficient response process.

The documents posted today address congestion management, pricing, facilities inclusion, market monitoring, and planning.  You can access these documents on the RTO West website at www.rtowest.org/Stage2RRG_Upcoming.htm <http://www.rtowest.org/Stage2RRG_Upcoming.htm>.   As I mentioned in the previous notice, these documents are preliminary rough drafts and represent work-in-progress on these subjects.  These preliminary drafts are being made available to interested parties now so we can all have the benefit of thorough review and feedback as drafting proceeds.  None of the documents have been approved by the filing utilities.

We look forward to seeing you next Wednesday,

- Bud
 
P.S. - As with the previous announcement related to the December 19 meeting, this message is being sent to multiple recipient lists that have overlapping participants.  I apologize to all of you who get multiple copies of this message.
