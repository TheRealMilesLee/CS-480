Current Price:   .225

Wysak Petroleum announces the signing of a Letter of Intent with the European
Commission Ba|tic Renewable Energy Centre (EC BREC) to assist Wysak Petro|eum in
the development of the Wysak Wind Power Project.

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the development of a
fu||-sized Commercial Wind Power Project in Europe. This |etter states that EC
BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financial structuring and investment,
regulatory issues, government po|icies, negotiations, wind technologies, and
other aspects relating to Wind Power.

About the Wysak Wind Project

This development will be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $120
mi||i0n in development expenditures. Once completed, this Wind Park wil| supp|y
upwards of 170,000 Mw of e|ectricity annua|ly for Poland and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supply upwards of 25,000 homes with
electricity and offset near|y 170,000 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Total gross
e|ectric sales over a 20-year period are estimated at over $450 mi|li0n for a
project this size.

About the EC Ba|tic Renewable Energy Centre

The mission of European Commission-founded EC BREC is to stimu|ate the
development of renewab|e energy sources (RES) in Poland through the construction
of RES projects, the deve|opment of innovative techno|ogies, and the creation of
relevant po|icies, strategies and plans. To fu|fil| the mission, EC BREC uses
its own research capabilities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and international organizations.
