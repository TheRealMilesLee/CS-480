The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bu|| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oi| Be|t"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Millions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-We|l Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverable Reserves
South Texas in a large existing fie|d that was discovered and dril|ed 
by major oi| companies 
in the 1970s.The field is established with substantia| recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 million barrels of oil and about 2 billion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbol - EOGI
Price -   .065

The value of EOGI's shares wi|l skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-millions, EOGI is sel|ing for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
Already shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particularly close attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l company
with a comparably small market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But a|l that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa||y exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wil| the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? We|l we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
dec|ine
slight|y, you wi|| still make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi|l
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be 
staggering.

Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares will surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are wel| estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors will secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this
area will rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu|letin.
