Susan,
attached is a new matrix for each desk.  This should replace the previous matrix you are using.  We are just putting our groups down in the access request list and this should be used to cross reference.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Susan,

These are book requests for the Netco books for all regions.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  We put in some book and portfolio codes we would like if they are available.  If not, please call me.  We need all price, basis, index, and gas daily US books to be the same, all Canadian books to be the same and all physical books to have the same codes please.

Thanks

Kam
