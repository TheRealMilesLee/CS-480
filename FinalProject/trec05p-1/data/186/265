2001 Members, 

Please remember that next Wednesday, 1/9/02 is our first monthly luncheon
for the year 2002. We are extremely excited to have Pamela Lovett,
President, Economic Development Division of Greater Houston Partnership
speaking to us and hope everyone will be able to attend. Please see the
attached RSVP form.  Because of the holidays, we have extended the response deadline to the end of the business day on Monday, January 7.  With time being of the essence, we encourage you to make your reservation for the luncheon by e-mail to Tammy Naron (see attached meeting notice). 

2002 MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION
Also, if you have not already completed a 2002 membership application,
please do that as well and bring with you next Wednesday to avoid
non-membership prices.
