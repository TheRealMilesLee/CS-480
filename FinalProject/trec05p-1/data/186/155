1) Do you know if NetCo is going to have similar arrangements in Canada to what we had before bankruptcy? (e.g. trader in Houston trades Eastern Canada on behalf of ENA, but trader in Calgary trades Western Canada on behalf of ECC)

2) Looks like we might have to prepay 1 month to preserve Reuters content. I'm assuming this is no big deal, as we will still be month-to-month and can cancel.
