Dear Mr. Kean, 

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me on October 2, 2001 in regard 
to the Analyst position at Enron.  I had a great time learning more about 
yourself and your company.  In particular, I was impressed with the 
rotational structure of Enron's two-year analyst program.  I also enjoyed 
your discussion on the various and plentiful strengths and highlights of the 
company.  

I believe that my experience this summer at JPMorganChase has provided me 
with a transferable skill set that would allow me to be successful at Enron.  
My achievements there are also evidence of my ability to work well in a team 
environment.  In addition, with my planned graduation from Rice this 
December, I would like to express my ability and interest to begin work 
during spring.  

Again, thank you for taking the time in coming to Rice and getting to know 
me, and I look forward to our continued correspondence.
