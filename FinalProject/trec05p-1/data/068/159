Tana -

Please be in touch with Bob to confirm the appropriate name.  Also, if the name is different than APB, we need to confirm that any collateral they posted, if any, is capable of covering the different entity.  Please also confirm with Bob whether or not APB did in fact post any collateral.

Thanks.

Mark

We need to verify with Joe what the name should be.  They acquired these firms and I'm not sure how the document should be drafted.

Is there a different name for APB Energy Europe or are we doing additional deals?
