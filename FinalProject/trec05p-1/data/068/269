The EMERY Financial Group is committed to providing our clients with the highest levels of service, information and guidance.  To this end, we extend this invitation to meet with us for a regular review.  The agenda will include:

· Review of recent events pertinent to the equity and bond markets
· Review of your portfolio (absolute performance; performance relative to benchmark; performance and allocation relative to your long term financial objectives)
· Discussion of any new opportunities or changes since our most recent review- from your perspective and ours

Please take the time to contact our offices and set an appointment.  Regular communication and review is one of the most important factors for achieving long term financial objectives- and at the very least provides an opportunity for us to visit with each other.

Best regards,


Rocky V. Emery
