Hi, I wanted to let you know that the CADER's DG conference on November 1-2, 2001 in San Diego, will be held as scheduled. Please disregard this message if you have already registered for the conference. If not, I have some good news. I am aware of the difficulties in planning your trip and hence, we have extended the early-bird registration until October 15th for your convenience. However, the group rate at the Hotel will expire on October 8th. So please hurry and make your reservation for the Hotel room.

The revised program is posted on the www.cader.org . Sponsorship has been very good and we have just a couple of exhibit spots left if you are still interested. Also, the attendance is picking up well. We are now already up to 200 attendees. So please hurry and get your registration in at the earliest opportune time. Frankly, your early registration will help me immensely in planning and coordinating the conference.

Join us for 2  days of comprehensive discussions, questions and answers - your input is essential for a successful DG market.

Thanks, and do not hesitate to call me if you have any questions.

Jairam.
