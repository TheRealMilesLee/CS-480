Couple of questions.....

1.  I am unable to find Jaime Williams - is he on SAP or do you know if he goes by a different name? [Jones, Robert W.- HR Exec]   -He is not in the USA SAP.  He needs to be changed in GIS.  Ben B. can help make the change. 

2.  The following individuals have either Louise or John listed as their supv in SAP - do you know the correct supervisor?

Joseph Kishkill [Jones, Robert W.- HR Exec]   - Termed 
James Schwieger [Jones, Robert W.- HR Exec]   - Tom Martin 
Colleen Sullivan-Shaklovitz [Jones, Robert W.- HR Exec]   - Don Black 
John Zufferli [Jones, Robert W.- HR Exec]   - John Lavorato 

Thanks for your help!

Louise has asked me to send you the org chart for her and John Lavorato.  She would like all systems to show their direct reports correctly.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
