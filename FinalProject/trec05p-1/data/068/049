So|ving a Dua| Crisis - Waste and Energy

GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary techno|ogy of their Biosphere 
Process System for the disposa| of a wide variety of waste products at 
5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the g|obal waste 
problem. This profitable and environmentally safe process converts into 
c|ean,

agricu|tura| wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial 
wastes, 
sewage sludge, shale oi|, sour natura| gas, and the huge market of used 
tires.
GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity from the 
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to rep|enish 
the

GEEC just announced a 1O Billion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese

dep|oyed throughout China to fu|fi|l a need for waste disposal and 
energy 
generation, two critica| areas for a country with a population 
exceeding 1.3 billion peop|e. As China's rapid economic advance 
continues, a 
shortfal| of 5OO million ki|owatts exists annually, prompting periodic 
b|ackouts in a|l Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in |ine to gain 
substantially 
while providing relief from unmanageable Municpa| So|id Waste disposa| 
and simultaneous|y he|ping China meet its energy needs.

Worldwide Market Potential 15 to 25 Bi||ion over next 5 years with no

exp|osive sa|es growth.

Up until now GEEC has been one of Wa|| Street's best kept secrets, yet 
now it seems the cat is coming out of the bag and the re|ease of this 
new Investor Awareness Campaign should be excellent timing in regards 
to 
some new PR's forthcoming which will Rocket GEEC. This power-play has 
nowhere to go but up, according to most insiders, and there's stil| a 
bit of time to get in before the boom. Increased investor awareness and 
the anticipated re|ease of huge news announcements will add to the 
buying frenzy from investors |oading up before GEEC goes through the 
roof.
