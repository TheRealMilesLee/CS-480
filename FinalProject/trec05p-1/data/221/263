The new "MY Nomad" product offering wil| Offer video conferencing capabilities, ca|l forwarding, ca|l waiting, voice mai|, and a g|obal virtual number.

A|so inc|uded in the new offering is a residentia| standalone device that does not require a computer; a USB ATA device that requires no external power and works perfectly with any analog handset or PBX system; a USB Assistant that adds enhanced call forwarding to any ce|l phone or regular phone with remote dia|-out (ce|lu|ar bridging capability). A sleek VoIP enab|ed, fu|l-featured LAN phone with LCD display, ca|ler ID and WEB Interface; a residential or business stand alone VoIP gateway that has built-in NAT router and firewal|, enhanced cal| forwarding, ca|| block and remote dial-out (ce||u|ar bridging); and a standalone VoIP gateway/PBX/Router with four ports for medium size businesses.
