Hi Anne…
 
I've been told by Hunter Shively and David Oxley that my commitment to transitioning this organization will end when the deal closes late this week.  As such, I have met again with Hunter and Jay to make sure that my part of this transition is complete.  I am tying up some loose ends today - and hopefully these guys will have everything they need (from me) by this afternoon.  David told me that as long as these guys are satisfied - then I'm clear to go back to the estate with my job over here complete. 
 
With this new information - I do not believe that I need to meet with the employment attorney at this time.  Thank you for your help.  I will update you once things are complete over here.

Hey guys,
 
Lizette Palmer, our employment attorney, would be more than happy to meet with you at 9:30 in 3817A (old building) if you would still like some reassurance that your transition help will not create a conflict of interest.
 
Also, I am on 4 in the new building now, so if you need anything, please just let me know.

Thanks,
Anne
