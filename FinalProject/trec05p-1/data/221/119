They can be sent from Houston, but I think you will need UBS AG, 
Stamford Branch stationary.  Have you gotten a supply for this purpose?

We are in the process of preparing Master Agreements to go to customers.

Can these draft contracts be sent directly from here?

Obviously, each pack is quite large - it would be nice to avoid having 
to ship them to Connecticut just to have them forwarded from there.
