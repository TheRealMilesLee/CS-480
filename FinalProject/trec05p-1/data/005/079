Dear Friend,


I am Peter Freeman,a private financial consultant /Account portfolio manager of 
FUNDSWORTH LTD,Ipswich UK.And i Happen to have managed a particular account for 
a Resident Foreigner,here in the United Kingdom,who died Intestate, leaving in our care a 
sizable amount in a domicialliary United States Dollars Investment ACC. For some reason 
this client does not have an easily identifiable next of Kin have
made several enquiries to locate any of my clients relatives; immediate and 
extended, this has proved unsuccessful. 


Hence, I am contacting you. I need your assistance in securing the money and property left 
behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Finance 
House here in the United Kingdom. The Finance House has already issued a Government 
Mandatory formalty notice to provide the Next of Kin or have the account confiscated and 
this should expire within a month.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating any of his relatives for over two 
years and convinced that no one is coming up and having satisfied the 
mandatory legalrequirement of Beneficiary/next of kin Notification, I now seek a 
Reliable and Trustworthy person,with your consent and perfect understanding, to 
present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of this account initially 
valued at Twenty One Million, Three Hundred And Twenty Thousand United States 
Dollars, interest not inclusive, can be paid into an account to be provided by you
(prefereably outside the United Kingdom Financial
Institutions or its Isles), as the perceived Next Of Kin Legally and 
Otherwise.

All I require is your honest cooperation and confidence in me; which I know 
would not come easy. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate 
background that will protect you from any breach of the law. I would advise 
that you give this positive consideration and get back to me soon. I'll be flexible and 
considerate in the percentage share that will be given to you for your assistance. 

Upon receipt of your response I'll send to you my private number so that you can 
reach me for further discussion.  

Regards,


Peter Freeman.
