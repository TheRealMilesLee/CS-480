DEAR FRIEND
 
I KNOW YOU WILL BE SURPRISED TO RECEIVE THIS MASSAGE FROM ME SINCE YOU DO NOT
KNOW ME PERSONALLY.I WORK WITH THE ABOVE NAMED BANK, AS THE FORIEGNER
REMITTANCE ACCOUNTANT IN THE BANK.I AM CONTACTING YOU IN THE RESPECT OF OUR
CUSTOMERS WHO DIE SOME YEARS BACK.
 
IN MY DEPARTMENT I DISCOVERED AN ABANDONED FUND DEPOSITED BY THIS DECEASED
CLIENT WHO DIED SOME YEARS BACK ,HOWEVER, SINCE I GOT INFORMATION ABOUT HIS
DEATH,I HAVE MADE SEVERAL ENQUIRIES THROUGH HIS EMBASSY TO LOCATE ANY OF HIS
EXTENDED RELATIVES, BECAUSE I AM HIS ACCOUNT OFFICER IN THE BANK,AND THIS HAS
ALSO PROVED UNSUCCESSFUL AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS.
 
HENCE I DECIDED TO CONTACT YOU BASED ON THIS DEAL WHICH IS HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL
AND I REPOSED ON YOU THAT YOU CAN BE CAPABLE OF EXECUTING HIS TRANSACTION AND
TO STAND AS THE BENEFICIARY AS NEXT OF KIN TO CLAIM HIS FUND BEFORE IT IS
DECLARED UNSERVICEABLE SO THAT WE CAN DISBURSED THE FUND IN THE MUTUAL
UNDERSTANDING OF 60% TO ME AND 35% TO YOU,WHILE 5% WILL BE FOR EXPENSES INCURE
DURING THE PROCESS OF THE TRANSACTION. AFTER THE CLAIMING AND TRANSFER OF THE
FUNDS TO YOUR ACCOUNT.

NOTE THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO LAY HANDS ON THIS FUND THAT IS REASON
THE REQUEST FOR A FOREIGNER IS NEEDED IN THIS BUSNIESS, COUPLED WITH THE FACT
THAT THE BENEFICIARY WAS A MAN FROM YOUR COUNTRY AND A BENIN MAN CANNOT CLAIM
THIS FUND AS THE BENEFICIARY NEXT OF KIN.
  
THEREFORE,TO ENABLE THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF THIS FUND TO YOUR ACCOUNT,I WILL
NEED YOUR FULL CONTACT ADDRESS TELEPHONE AND FAX TO USE IT AND DO THE
CHANGEING OF BENEFICIARY NAME IN YOUR FAVOUR SO THAT I WILL SEND YOU THE TEST
OF APPLICATION WHICH YOU WILL FORWARD TO THE BANK TO RECOGNIZE YOU AS THE BONA
FIDE NEXT OF KIN TO THE DISEASED.
 
BE ASSURED THAT THIS WILL BE EXECUTED UNDER A LEGITIMATE ARRANGEMENT THAT WILL
PROTECT US FROM ANY BREACH OF THE LAW,UPON YOUR ACCEPTANCE I WILL CLARIFY YOU
MORE ABOUT THIS BUSINESS AND THE TOTAL AMOUNT INVOLVED ALSO GIVE YOU THE
CONTACT OF THE BANK FOR YOU TO SEND THE APPLICATION.
 
BEWARNED NOT TO REVEAL THIS TRANSACTION TO ANY OTHER THIRD PARTY TO AVOID
JEOPARDIZE THIS BUSINESS AND MY POSITION IN THIS OFFICE,PLEASE TREAT THIS
MATTER AS URGENT AS POSSIBLE. I WILL BE EXPECTING YOUR SOONEST RESPONSE.CALL
ME ON MY DIRECT PHONE +229576430 FOR MORE INFORMATION OR CONTACT ME THROUGH MY
PERSONAIL EMAIL ADDRESS ABOVE.
 
YOURS FAITHFULLY,
 
MR OLIVER J. OJEMBA
