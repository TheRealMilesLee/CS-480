Dear Partner,

I guess this letter may come to you as surprise since
I had no previous correspondence with you.

I am the chairman tender board of the independent national electoral
commission (INEC). I got your contact in my search for a reliable
person handle a very confidential transaction involving the transfer of
the sum of $14.500.000 Dollars (Fourteen Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars) the above fund is not connected with
arms, drugs or money laundering. It is the product of an over invoiced
contract
awarded in 1999 by (INEC) to a foreign company for the supply of
electoral materials that were used for conducting the 1999 elections.

The contract has long been executed and payment of the actual contract
amount has been made to the foreign contractor leaving the balance of
US$14.5 million which my colleagues and I now want to transfer out of
Nigeria into a reliable foreign account for our personal use. As civil
servants we are not allowed to run foreign accounts.
Hence we have chosen to front and support you as the beneficiary t o
this fund. If you are interested in the proposal kindly get back to me
by sending me your letter of acceptance along with your direct
telephone and fax numbers, we have decided to share the money in the
following percentage, 60% for us 30% for you the account owner and 10%
for all local and international expenses that may arise in the course
of this transaction.

Further details about this transaction will be discussed in subsequent
correspondence.

Note also that the particular nature of your business is irrelevant to
this transaction and this transaction is expected to be concluded
within 10 working days since all local contacts and arrangements are in
place for a smooth and successful conclusion of this transaction.

Contact me via email with your contact telephone and fax numbers, so
that I can call you for a discussion.

Thank you as I await your response.

Sincerely,
Dr.Denise AdeDear Partner,

Dr.Denise AdeDear Partner,

I guess this letter may come to you as surprise since
I had no previous correspondence with you.

I am the chairman tender board of the independent national electoral
commission (INEC). I got your contact in my search for a reliable
person handle a very confidential transaction involving the transfer of
the sum of $14.500.000 Dollars (Fourteen Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars) the above fund is not connected with
arms, drugs or money laundering. It is the product of an over invoiced
contract
awarded in 1999 by (INEC) to a foreign company for the supply of
electoral materials that were used for conducting the 1999 elections.

The contract has long been executed and payment of the actual contract
amount has been made to the foreign contractor leaving the balance of
US$14.5 million which my colleagues and I now want to transfer out of
Nigeria into a reliable foreign account for our personal use. As civil
servants we are not allowed to run foreign accounts.
Hence we have chosen to front and support you as the beneficiary t o
this fund. If you are interested in the proposal kindly get back to me
by sending me your letter of acceptance along with your direct
telephone and fax numbers, we have decided to share the money in the
following percentage, 60% for us 30% for you the account owner and 10%
for all local and international expenses that may arise in the course
of this transaction.

Further details about this transaction will be discussed in subsequent
correspondence.

Note also that the particular nature of your business is irrelevant to
this transaction and this transaction is expected to be concluded
within 10 working days since all local contacts and arrangements are in
place for a smooth and successful conclusion of this transaction.

Contact me via email with your contact telephone and fax numbers, so
