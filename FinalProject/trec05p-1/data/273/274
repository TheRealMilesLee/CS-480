Compliments,

I hope that this mail will not be an embarrassment to you.
You have been recommended by an associate from our foreign trade council
who assured me in confidence of your trustworthiness and faith in God.
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I
believe everyone will die someday

I am Mrs. Maria Al-Qadhi, a merchant in Kuwait; I am married to Sheikh
Salem Al-Qadhi who worked with Kuwait embassy in Dubai for eight years
before he died in the year 2002.
We were married for eleven years without a child.  Since his death I
decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home.

I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer, which has defiled all forms
of medical treatment. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I
never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business.
With all my wealth, I was never generous and was always hostile to people
and only focusing on my business.

But now I regret all this, as I now know that there is more to life than
just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.  I believe when
God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a
different way from how I have lived it. I have willed and given almost of
my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well
as a few close friends.
I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so I have decided
to give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the
last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some
charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia.

Presently, my health has deteriorated so badly, that I can no longer do
this myself anymore.  I once asked members of my family to close one of my
accounts and distribute the money, which I have there to charity
organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the money to
themselves.

Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contented with
what I have left for them.

The last of my money, which no one knows of, is the cash deposit of Twelve
Million United States Dollars (US$12,000,000.000) deposited with a
finance/security company abroad.

Since I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me
that I might not be able to survive this illness from all indications, it
is my last wish to see this money distributed to victims of Hiv/Aids,
charity organizations, orphans and needy widows in your country.
My relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my
illness and I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge
responsibility to them.

Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed in this regard, I propose a
commission of 10% of the above sum to you for this purpose.

I will not be able to use the telephone communication in this regard
because of my soundless voice and the presence of my husband's relatives
around me always.
As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the
finance/security company and also issue you a Letter of Authority to take
over the deposit and disburse it accordingly on my behalf.

Please assure me that you will act as I stated herein.

Kindly send your reply enclosing your Contact  and email address to my
private email address of mariaalqadhi@volja.net, for confidentiality.

Mrs.Maria Al-Qadhi
