Dear Sir/ 

Do not be very surprised to receive this letter. My name is Robert Odette 
Guei Jr and I am the son of late general Robert Guei, the formal military 
president of Ivory Coast. He was the opposition leader against
the government during the military uprising that took place on September 
19th, 2002. 

My entire family was killed in cold blood by the government forces while 
sitting at our home in bidjan. This massacre was reported in foreign 
newstations such as CNN and BBC then. 

Fortunately, I was not at home when this massacre took place. As a mater of 
fact, I am the only surviving member in the family of general Robert Guei. 
My life is not safe. The country is becoming chaotic
everyday due to government and rebels are in logger ahead who controls the 
northern part of the country and I am not feeling comfortable about the 
whole situation I need your help to get me out of this country into your 
country . 

You will also help me to transfer my fathers money, worth of $25 million us 
dollars, from one of the European countries to your private account. After 
this transfer,I will join you in your country so that you can help me to 
invest my own share. 

After we first make contact, we will decide on your commission. I need your 
assistance very quickly so I will forward all the necessary documents to 
you. Because this is a matter of urgency, I do not want this transfer to 
last more than three weeks. 

I am waiting for your reply. 

Sincerely Yours, 

Robert Odette Guei Jr.
