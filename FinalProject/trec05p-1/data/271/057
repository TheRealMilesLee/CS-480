PLEASE REPLY TO moses1@wanadoo.es 

Dear Friend, 
I sincerely write to seek your co-operation and trust to enable me carry out an urgent business 
Opportunity in my department. I work with the GLOBAL BANK PLC BENIN ; currently I am in charge of 
bills and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my bank. I was the account officer to 
one Mr & Mrs PAULA who worked wtih Chevron Oil company ,Who died along with his wife in the 
December 25th, 2003 Air Crash in Benin Republic. 

He left in his domiciliary account the amout of $15.5 million(Fifteen million five hundred thousand 
USA Dollars).Since the management got the information of his death we have been expecting any of 
his relation or his next of kin to come up and claim his money. 

Unfortunately from the day of his death till the time of this letter none of his relation or 
friends has come up for the claim.The banking and financial law of GLOBAL BANK PLC BENIN stipulates 
that if such fund remained unclaimed after a period of (24) months it will be lost to the bank as 
unclaimed deposit. 

On this note, I now decided to do business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin 
to the deceased for subsequent disbursement among us.I will soon proceed for my retirement leave, 
and I personally do not want this fund to be lost to the bank. That is why I wanted the fund to be 
move out of the bank before I proceed on my retirement from the banking services. 

The need for a foreigner as next of kin in this project is occasioned by the fact that the customer 
was a foreigner and a Beninnois will not perfectly fit in as his next of kin or heir. I have agreed 
that 30% of the Fund would be for you as foreign partner, thereafter I will visit your country for 
disbursement according to the percentages indicated. 

To enable the immediate transfer of the fund into your nominated account, you would have to fill 
the bank application form for such claim as the next of kin to the deceased. There you will 
designate your bank account where the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your mail indicating 
your interest, 

I will send to you a copy of the application form and the Account/ Deceased information you would 
need to fill it.Send your direct Fax and telephone numbers for effective communication that this 
transaction needs. Please note that you are not to appear in person, as every thing regarding this 
project will be strictly handled by a lawyer and every banking documents needed for this 
transaction will be taken care of by lawyer. 

PLEASE VIEW THE WEBSITE.
