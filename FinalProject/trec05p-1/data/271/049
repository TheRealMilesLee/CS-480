Chris,
I've got calls into the counterparty that has been buying our TW gas month-to-month.
I don't have any market information to work the transaction.  I need to either have 
someone sell this gas on ECS's behalf or to provide me with a market perspective.
I've got a few others that I'll approach about purchasing this gas.  Any ideas or
contacts for West Texas or Permian gas?
