Mark,

Williams will be buying Juniper's crude from EI 28 and EI 57 for December 01 thru May 02.

The price for the EI 28 crude is Koch WTI plus $1.45.  The price for the EI 57 crude is Koch WTI plus $2.38.  

Per our phone discussion, you will automatically pay Juniper each month...no invoice is needed from me.  However, I will be contacting you each month, just to confirm that payments will be made.

I will need to get back with you re exact name of the Juniper entity, and address, state of inc.... so you can put together a 6 month contract.
