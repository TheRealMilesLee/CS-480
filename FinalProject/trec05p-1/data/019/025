Louise,
 
We got comments back from Allegheny.  We are in general agreement - this will require some tweaking over the weekend.  Conf call scheduled for Saturday.  Dan Gordon just commented that "looks like we are getting done".  
 
Plan: Sign Monday which gives us the five business days to pull it together.
 
Crisis averted for now.
 
Have a good weekend.  Talk with you Monday.
 
Regards,
 
Chris
