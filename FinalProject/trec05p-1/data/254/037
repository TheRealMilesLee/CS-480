The following items were discussed in this weeks corporate change control...

Mar. 21
From 5:00 - 7:30 p.m., the Corporate Unix team will perform maintenance on dns1-corp.  Dns1-corp is the primary dns server for enron.com domain.  Queries to enron.com domain will be forwarded to dns2-corp which is the secondary dns server.  No impact is expected.
Mar. 21
From 7:00 - 8:00 p.m., the Messaging team will update the virus engine on Mailsweeper servers. This will be done on a monthly basis for better protection against new viruses.  No impact is expected.
Mar. 21
From 8:00 - 11:45 p.m., the Corporate Security team will re-enable the File Replication Service on all Corporate domain controllers.  This change is necessary to replicate security policies.   FRS will be started on Corp DCs one at a time, watching to be sure replication completes.  Brief outages of Corp.enron.com security policies and possibly Exchange may occur.  The Messaging team will be notified if replication causes problems.  Support staff whose applications experience problems due to FRS should contact the solution center at ext. 54745.
Mar. 23
From 5:00 p.m. through 3/24 at 7:00 a.m., the Envision system will be taken offline to perform backups.  Users will not be able to access information located on Envision during this maintenance.
Mar. 25
From 9:00 a.m. through 4/5 at 3:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will make WINS/DNS changes on all servers to reflect the new server settings.  Devices that require a reboot will be submitted via a separate change control.   Some impact may occur during these changes and that information will be forwarded as it becomes available.
May 1
At 5:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will remove access to CORPHOU-DC07 (172.23.226.23, primary/secondary DNS) and NAHOU-NSWN03 (172.23.226.24, primary/secondary WINS) from devices within ECN.   All servers/workstations/equipment using these for WINS/DNS must have their settings changed. Use 172.16.7.120 for DNS and 172.16.7.116 for WINS in their place by this 5/01.  
Future Changes:
ENS backbone will be upgrading the code on the floor switches in the very near future.  Individual companies will be contacted as the floors are scheduled.  This will result in network outages for ETS and will be coordinated with ENS.
