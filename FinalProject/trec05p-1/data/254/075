  GPM Dumas will be shutting their process plant down in the morning Friday, March 22, through Tuesday, March 26th. During this time Sunray will  switch them from the C-line to the B-line so it can be taken to the inlet of Bushton. Spearman and Sunray will be coordinating the switching of valves. Hutch 1 will have to be shut-in during this time since they were using the B-line to freeflow into the suction of Spearman. All parties have been notified.
