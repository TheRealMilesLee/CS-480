FYI,
I went to the team meeting and it really sounds like a lot of fun. Let Eric Johnson know by the first of next week if you are interested.

Jerry

Hello everyone!  We are looking to form a team (or teams) of Enron employees and spouses to participate in a new golf league, the inaugural season of the Corporate Team Golf Cup - Houston!

Some of you received this e-mail because you participated in the Enron-sponsored golf league in the past.  We thought you would be interested in joining us this season!    Please pass this on to other golfers you know within Enron that may not have received this e-mail.

The new league is sponsored by the Southern Texas PGA.  The purpose of the league is to create an environment for corporate personnel to network, interact, and build friendships and business relationships through a competitive and social golf program.

The league will include companies (teams) from the Houston area.  A few of the companies that have already committed to play are PWC, Reliant, Compaq, and Texaco.  Each team will have eight (8) players at each event and will compete once a month against another team.  The inaugural season will include six (6) monthly events plus a tournament for the finalists in November.

The deadline for entering our team(s) is coming up.  Please let me know if you are interested by Tuesday 3/19/02.  We will have a meeting later that week to answer questions and to sign everyone up.  Please don't hesitate to call or e-mail me should you have any questions.

I have also attached a flyer for you to pass on to people at other companies who may be interested in forming their own team.

Come join us -- we're looking forward to a great season!
