A new change control has been added...

Mar. 22
From 5:00 - 7:00 p.m., the EDI team will migrate the ECNET server from the 172.28.176.249 network.  This migration will cause a total outage for the ECNET server.  Applications accessing this device via IP address will need to be changed to reflect the new IP which is 172.16.2.22.  The EDINET server at 172.28.176.21 will also be migrated the week of Apr. 6.  More information regarding that change will be available next week.
