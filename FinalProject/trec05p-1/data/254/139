He said his own associates also had been warning him about the family, but he continued to try to help them because "I felt sorry for (the boy)."On Tuesday, talk-show host Jay Leno testified that he received several phone messages from Michael Jackson's accuser in 2000 and talked to him briefly on the phone, but the comedian said neither the boy nor his family asked him for money. (Leno's testimony)During their earlier testimony, family members said Jackson and his associates, who told them they were going to Florida to participate in a news conference that never was held, initiated the trip. The prosecution has also pointed to the Miami trip as part of a conspiracy to control and intimidate the family to get them to participate in damage control operations after the Bashir documentary.The accuser's younger brother, a key prosecution witness in the trial, was even more cunning, Tucker said, to the point that the "Rush Hour" star felt e needed "to check (the brother's) pockets before he left my house."</FONT> </DIV>
