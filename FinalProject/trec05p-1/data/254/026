Dear Bill and John,
 
With the anticipated cold weather on our system Friday, March 22, NNG would like NBPL to deliver 30,000 MMBtu extra volume to NNG for March 22.  NNG will return those volumes to NBPL within the following 15 day period.  Please use the OBA at Ventura to accommodate this activity.  Please communicate this activity to Gas Control.
 
Thanks,
 
Sue Neville
