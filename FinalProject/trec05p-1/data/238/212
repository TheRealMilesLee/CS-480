(PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL)
JOHNSON BUTHELEZI
77 ABEL ROAD
YEOVILLE, JHB
SOUTH AFRICA
TEL: 27_8398_03325

Dear Sir/Madam,

With due respect my name is JOHNSON BUTHELEZI, the eldest son of MR.ANDREW 
BUTHELEZI of ZIMBABWE. It might be a surprise to you where I got your 
contact address; I got it from the South African Information Network Online 
(SAINO) at South African Trade Center. And it is coming to you with good 
intention.

During the current crisis against the farmers of Zimbabwe by the supporters 
of our President, ROBERT MUGABE to claim all the white owned farms in our 
country. He ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to his 
party members and their followers.

My father was one of the greatest and best farmers in the country and he did 
not support the President's political ideology, and the President's 
supporters invaded my father's farm and burnt down everything, shot him and 
as a result of the injuries sustained, he became sick and died after five 
days. And after his death, my younger brother and I decided to move out of 
Zimbabwe for the safety of our lives to South Africa.

But before he died he wrote his will, which reads "MY BELOVEED SON, I WISH 
TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE SUM OF US$25,000,000.00 (TWENTY FIVE MILLION 
UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) WHICH I DEPOSITED IN A BOX WITH A SECURITY 
COMPANY IN JOHANNESBURG SOUTH AFRICA IN CASE OF MY ABSENCE ON EARTH CAUSED 
BY DEATH ONLY.YOU SHOULD SOLICIT FOR A RELIABLE FOREIGN PARTNER TO ASSIST 
YOU TO TRANSFERTHIS MONEY OUT OF SOUTH AFRICA FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES. I 
DEPOSITED THE MONEY IN YOUR NAME AND YOU CAN CLAIM IT ALONE WITH THE DEPOSIT 
CODE. YOUR MOTHER HAS ALL THE DECUMENTS. TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOUR MOTHER AND 
BROTHER".

From the above, you will understand that the lives and future of my family 
depends on this money and I will be very grateful if you can assist us. My 
younger brother and I are now living in South Africa as POLITICAL ASYLUM 
SEEKERS and the financial law of SOUTH AFRICA does not allow ASYLUM SEEKERS 
certain financial rights to such huge amount of money.

In view of this, I cannot invest this money in South- Africa, hence I am 
asking you to assist me to transfer this money out of South- Africa for 
investment purposes. For your efforts, I am prepared to offer you 20% of the 
total fund, while 5% will be set aside for local and international expenses 
and 75% will be kept for my family.

Finally, modalities on how the transfer will be done will be conveyed to you 
once we establish trust and confidence between ourselves. Looking forward to 
your urgent reply. For detailed information, please contact me on my direct 
line + 27-8398 _03325.

NOTE: THE KEY WORD TO THIS TRANSACTION IS ABSOLUTE CONFIDENTIALITY AND 
SECRECY. THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE. YOUR URGENT RESPONSE WILL BE 
HIGHLY
APPRECIATED.

All the best,

JOHNSON BUTHELEZI.
(FOR THE FAMILY)
