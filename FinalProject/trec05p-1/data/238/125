FROM RAPHAEL KAMARA

Dearest one,

Please pray before reading my mail for the result of undersatnding and tr=
uth
of my proposal.I am Raphael Kamara, the only son of late Chief Vincent
Kamara, from Sierra Leone. My sources of your contact gave me the courage=

and confidence to rely on you.

I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance=

to transfer our money of Nine million five hundred thousand dollars($9,50=
0,000)deposited
in the custody of a bank here in Abidjan to your private account pending
our rival to your country.

Source of the money. My late father, chief Vincent Kamara, a native of me=
nde
district in the Northern province of Sierra Leone, was the general Manage=
r
of Sierra Leone mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.)

According to my father, This money was the income accrued from mining co-=
operation
over draft and minor sales Before the peak of the civil war between the
rebels forces of major Paul Koromah and the combined forces of ecomog pea=
ce
keeping operation that almost destroyed my country, following the forcefu=
l
removal from power of the Civilian Elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah
by the rebels.

My father had already made arrangement for his family, my mother my littl=
e
sister and myself to be evacuated to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire with our pers=
onal
effects.

My father deposited the fund for the safe custody until after the war whe=
n
he will join us. During the war in my country, and following the indiscri=
minate
looting of public and Government properties by the rebel forces, the sier=
ra
Leone mining coop. Was one of the targets looted and killed My father inc=
luding
other top Government functionaries Were attacked and killed by the rebels=

because of his relationship with the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah.

As a result of my father's death, and with the news of my uncles involvem=
ent
in air crash, dashed our hope of survival. The untimely deaths caused my
mothers heart failure and other related complications of which she later
died in the hospital After we must have spent a lot of money on her.

Now my younger sister and myself are alone in this strange country suffer=
ing
without any careor help. Without any relation, we are now like refugee sa=
ndorphans,
Our only hope now is in this fund which our father deposited in the BANK.=


To this effect,I humbly solicit your assistance in the followings ways.
To assist me transfer this money out of this country so i all what i need=
ed
from you is to furnish me with your banking information and your persoanl=

contact so that i will go and submit it to the bank in order to effect th=
e
transfer on your destinated bank account and also make a good arrangement=

for a joint business investment on our behalf in your country, secure a
collage for my little sister and my self in your country to further our
education which we stoped during the war.

And to make arrangement for our travel with you to your country after you=

have transferred this fund.Most importantly. The whole documents issued
to my late father during the deposit is with me.

I beg to concede 15 % of this money to you for your efforts assistance.

Best regards.

Raphael Kamara.
