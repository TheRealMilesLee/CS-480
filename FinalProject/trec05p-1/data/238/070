Men,
 
            The final descision on the night of men will be as follows…
 
Where: Tony's Mexican (bring your own clown and accessories, please)
 
When: Thursday 2/28 at 7:15 pm.
 
We will wait until Zander is able to attend, to try the Tampico place. Would rather go w/ someone who knows the drill.
 
I am very much looking forward to seeing all of you men. 
 
                                                                                         Pig-N-a-Stinky-blanket
