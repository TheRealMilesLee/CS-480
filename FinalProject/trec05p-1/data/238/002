L IS THE CASE")


Complimant Of The Season,

On a very good day. I am ( Kojo Peters Esq),The Manager of file / Debt
recovery Department in African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact=
 from
a yahoo tourist search.

When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability=
 and
reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God =
or
Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15=

million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account =
that
belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire f=
amily
in (Monday 31St July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information a=
bout
his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and clai=
m his
money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as ne=
xt of
kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines,=
 but
unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation d=
ied
alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the cla=
im.
It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my depar=
tment
now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the mone=
y to
you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subse=
quent
disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money=
 to
go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remain=
ed
unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in =
this
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, a=
nd a
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 =
% of
this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provis=
ion
of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured durin=
g the
business and 60 % would be for ;me and my woman colleague. There after =
I and
my colleague will visit your country for disbursement according to the
percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arra=
nged,
you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the dec=
eased
indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telep=
hone
and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where =
the
money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you b=
y fax
or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your n=
otice
that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain a=
ny
atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfe=
r.

You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97,immediately as soon=
 as
you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.

Your's faithfully,

Kojo Peters (Esq.)

POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transf=
er to
move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you
finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss ver=
y
well over this business.Please call me and inform me that you received =
my
mail, because i don't go to net always.
