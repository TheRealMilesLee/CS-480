REPUBLIC OF BENIN. WEST AFRICA.=20
TEL: 229 58 45 73.

Hello My Dear,=20

I am Dr.Salam Kabore, the director in charge of auditing and accounting=
 section of African Development Bank cotonou benin republic in west Afr=
ica with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a bus=
iness transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end=
 of the transaction.=20

During our investigation and auditing in this bank,my department came a=
cross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died =
in a plane crash in year 2000, airline transafrik International with ai=
rcraft Lockheed L-100-30 at location Vila Nova,Angola with registration=
 number S9-CAO while travelling with his entire family of his wife,3 ch=
ildren and a maid on a festive visit to Angola.and since his untimely d=
eath the funds has been dormant in his account with this Bank without a=
ny claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation =
before our discovery to this development.=20

Although personally,i keep this information secret within myself and pa=
rtners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful =
during the time of execution.The said amount was usd$14.5M(Fourteen mil=
lion Five Hundred Thousand united states dollars).=20


As it may interest you to know,i got your impressive information throug=
h my good friends who works with chamber of commerce on foreign busines=
s relations here in Cotonou-Benin.

It is him who recommended your person to me to be viable and capable to=
 champion a business of such magnitude without any problem.

Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the =
bonafide next of kin to thedeceased, get the required approval and tran=
sfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directiv=
es and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicat=
e your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit yourself =
to this great business opportunity.=20

In fact i could have done this deal alone but because of my position in=
 this country as a civil servant,we are not allowed to operate a foreig=
n account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the =
time of transfer because i work in this bank.This is the actual reason =
why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as=
 the next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where h=
e will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it ma=
y be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent bran=
ch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own =
designated bank account.=20

May i at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free a=
s i have made arrangements for a successful arrangement as an insider o=
f the bank before contacting you.On smooth conclusion of this transacti=
on,you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification,while =
10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during th=
e time of transfer and also telephone bills,my travel ticket to come ov=
er to your country for the sharing of the fund while 60% will be for me=
 and my partners.=20

Please,you have been adviced to keep this a top secret as we are still =
in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this dea=
l with you.=20

I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you co=
nfirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country=
 for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously=
 indicated and further investment,either in your country or any country=
 you advice us to invest in.=20

All other necessary information will be sent to you on your acceptance =
to champion this transaction with me.i suggest you get back to me as so=
on as possible or you contact me on my private line 00229 58 45 73.stat=
ing your wish in this deal.=20
Yours Faithfully,=20
Dr.Salam Kabore,=20
