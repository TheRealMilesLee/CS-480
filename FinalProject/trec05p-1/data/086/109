Hey Guys!

I am glad we all met up for dinner last night.  It was great getting just
the girls together.  We need to do that more often.  Maybe we can make it a
monthly deal one night during the week.  

Also, thanks for treating me to dinner for my birthday.  That was not my
intention of dinner, but I do thank all of you.  


See you all later.

Jennifer
