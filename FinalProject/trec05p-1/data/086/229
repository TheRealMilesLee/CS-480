It appears that U.S. and Canadian officials responsible for softwood lumber negotiations have agreed to "a framework for a deal, not a final deal."  In our last update, we relayed an unconfirmed source report that a political deal had been worked out on softwood lumber between the US and Canada.  Efforts to confirm this information were conducted, and our results refute the existence of a firm deal.  There is, however, a new political climate in wake of September 11th, and both Ottawa and Washington would like to resolve the lumber dispute rather than have it continue on their radar screen now that they have other more urgent priorities.  Deputy USTR Mary Ryckman has been quoted as saying "We are looking to an alternative to litigation."  To that end, Washington has appointed former Montana governor Marc Racicot as 'envoy' for the US in negotiations.  Thus, it appears that both countries have agreed in principle that a deal is preferable to litigation, though no specific deal has been made and the litigation process will continue for now from both sides (the US petitions and the Canadian WTO actions).  We will continue to make appropriate inquiries on the negotiation process and report information as it is received. Meanwhile, the following reminders and updates:
Bilateral talks are in progress this week in Vancouver, BC, though initial reports indicate that things are going slowly.  Discussions center on BC's proposal for a new forest management policy (the details of which remain vague). 
The DOC's preliminary determination on AD has been postponed to October 30th; there will be no further delays. 
Bush's desire for a Free Trade Agreement in the Americas would be a trade agenda priority for which Canadian support would be important when the present crisis eases, providing further incentive for the US to negotiate.
