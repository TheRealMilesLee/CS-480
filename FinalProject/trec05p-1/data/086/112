Good morning.  Just wanted to say thanks again for dinner last night.  I
had fun.

4:30 came early this morning.  It always does.  Of course I didn't make it
to bed until 10:30 again so I only got 6 hours of sleep.  Makes for a "many
coca cola afternoon".

Will call you tomorrow to let you know when/where we'll be.
