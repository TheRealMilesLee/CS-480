David Jones in East Gas Origination completed a transportation management transaction with Yankee Gas last night.  This negotiation has been ongoing but the values and the structure have, until yesterday been extremely volatile.  David was able to bring the client to the table yesterday and complete the deal.  It is only a Nov 01 - Mar 02 term but should book orig of $400,000 +.  This was not on the hotlist due to the uncertainty that had been surrounding its completion.  Yankee has worked this transaction with Engage for the past several years, it is good to get one of these coming our way.

FYI 

Frank
