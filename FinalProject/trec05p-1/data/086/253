Don----Here's a couple of things we need to go over at the meeting:

1.)	PJM/NEPOOL SHEETS-----Night guys should open the spreadsheets and update the info hourly instead of waiting til morning 	and just copying the sheet.  Also need to make sure the infor is accurate.

2.)	Reminder:  All MHEB deals go in MHEB Service P&L and correct book in Enpower.

3.)	On PJM deals-----The Sale piece needs to be entered as an Index Forward not a Forward.  Also be sure we designate which 	interface it's going through.

4.)	Counterparty Selection----When in doubt----ask or send me an email.

Most of this is minor things but it's probably a good time to go over it.
