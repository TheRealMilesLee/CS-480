Here is response to question about estimated volume after blowers are
installed at Meserve.  I recall advising that Citation was moving
forward with the installation, but not sure exactly when.  Now we know.
We seem to be overproduced for the month so far and if this increase
holds true, adjustments will be needed for the last days of the November
and beyond.............TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!!!!!!!!  (sorry, but I
couldn't resist)
