Kirk,

Well, I am sorry that the project was denied a permit yesterday.  I know
that you (and many others) have worked very hard on this project.
Transwestern is still very interested in having Big Sandy connect to our
pipe.  I will stay in touch with you over the next few months, but
please don't hesitate to call me if there is anything we can do to help
you.

Thanks for keeping me posted,
Kim.

Hi Kim.
I trust that you are hanging in there with all of the recent activity.
As for Big Sandy, the project was denied a "permit" yesterday by the ACC
commissioners, driven principally by water issues.
As for next steps, Caithness plans to submit a new filing for the same
project, getting their "ducks in a row" on the water issues, and perhaps
even conceding to the potential of dry cooling versus wet cooling.
They expect to file this within the next 60 days.
Thus, with a little luck, we will be back in the game on this project
with
an induced delay.
I will keep you posted along the way....please do the same for me
regarding
any offerings/news/etc from your side.
Thanks for all of your help so far on the project.
Best regards.
Kirk

Hi Kirk,

I just wanted to check on you and see how the approval process was
going.  Have you heard from the ACC Commissioners yet?  Please let me
know if we can do anything for you.

Thanks, Kim.

Hi Kim.
Just wanted to let you know that the Big Sandy project is awaiting a
vote
yes/no from the ACC Commissioners on the 26th of this month.
At this point, I think it is likely that the project will not be
approved,
and may opt to resubmit.
Counsel for Caithness in the appeal process suggested a negative bias in
the
ACC Power Plant Siting Committee, and that was not well received by the
Commissioners....major blunder.
I will keep you updated as this continues to develop.
If a yes vote, then we will proceed immediately with interconnect
agreement,
etc.
Best regards,
Kirk
