Michelle,

Per our conversation, PPL EnergyPlus requests that Transwestern assign
20,000 mmbtu of primary receipts out of the West Texas Pool for the
period beginning June 1, 2002 through September 30, 2002.  During the
four month period beginning October 1, 2002 and ending February 28,
2003, the primary receipts will be reduced to 14,265 mmbtu.  Beginning
March 1, 2003 through June 30, 2032, primary receipts will be increased
to 20,000 mmbtu.  

For the four month period beginning October 1, 2002 and ending February
28, 2003, PPL requests an additional day to consider our supply options
prior to electing a primary receipt for the 5735 mmbtu not assigned.

Best Regards
David Smith
