Internet Daily 
for Tuesday, November 27, 2001
by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com


Web users surf twice as much at work

Web surfers in Italy, France, Australia and the U.S. who access 
the Internet from work spend considerably more time online than 
home Internet users. "Work Internet usage adds up to more time 
spent online and more Internet sessions, undoubtedly due to 
greater connection speeds and better usability," explained 
Richard Goosey, chief of measurement science and analytics at 
Nielsen/NetRatings.  He said marketers should take the work 
audience into account. "Applications such as banking, online 
trading and industry-specific directory searches are well 
targeted to the focused work audience," he said. In the U.S., 
NetRatings reported, male Web users spent an average of 21 hours 
44 minutes online at work each month and 11 hours 34 minutes at 
home.

Osama bin Laden, Harry Potter among top searches

Terra Lycos  reported that Osama bin Laden continued to be its 
most popular search term last week. Dragonball, Christmas, 
Thanksgiving and Harry Potter were also among the top 5 searches 
the site handled. The most popular cast member of Harry Potter 
isn't Harry himself,  Daniel Radcliff. According to Web users, 
the breakout star is actor Sean Biggerstaff, who portrays 
Harry's Quidditch rival, Oliver Wood.

Palm to end portal services

Palm Inc.  said it will close its free MyPalm Web portal Jan. 
10. Services such as an online calendar, address book and 
personal data will be deleted, the company said in a notice on 
its Web site. Services for wireless subscribers to Palm.Net will 
continue. A spokeswoman for the company told CNET interest in 
Web-based personal information management turned out to be less 
than expected. Advertising and subscriptions did not prove to be 
sources for adequate revenue.

Two-thirds of car buyers use Web

Sixty-two percent of all new-vehicle buyers are turning to the 
Internet for shopping information. Most go to the Web before 
they visit dealers, according to a J.D. Power and Associates 
study. Last year, Power reported 54% of vehicle shoppers relied 
on the Internet. On average, an automotive Internet user visits 
6.8 automotive sites before making a purchase, the research 
showed. Most also prefer independent Web sites. Kelley Blue Book 
 was the most visited site, as it has been for the past three 
years. Edmunds.com was said to be the most useful site.
