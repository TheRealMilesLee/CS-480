Debra,

Please, disregard the e-mail I just sent you on Phillips Gas Marketing Company.  The GISB we need to amend is with Phillips Petroleum Company.  The counterparty called back and drew to my attention that we incorrectly booked our deals under Phillips Gas Marketing Company.  The deals should have been booked under Phillips Petroleum Company and I have communicated same to the Trader.  Details for Phillips Petroleum Company are as follows:

Contact:  Janice White
Contract #: 96029335
E-mail: jgwhite@ppco.com
Phone: (713) 669-7351
Fax:(713) 669-7358

If you notice all the contact information stays the same except for the contract number.

Thanks,


Ann
