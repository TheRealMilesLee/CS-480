The Ascent Group, publisher of the Call Center E-Journal, announces the latest issue is now available on its new interactive web site -- www.callcenterejournal.com. The web site provides access to a database of call center best practices, company profiles, vendor directories, call center news, and recent contact center announcements and initiatives. CCE-J is a quarterly electronic journal designed to provide call center managers from all industries with actionable ideas and proven enhancement techniques.

Subscribers receive quarterly issues of the journal and gain access to the web site to:

… Search call center best practices database.
… Review call center profiles and statistics.
… Research vendors and call center technologies, services, and products.
… Review and download current and past issues of CCE-J.
… Review and download other contact center articles and research.
… Keep up with call center news, announcements, and initiatives.

CCE-J features in-depth interviews and original research that provide a perspective unlike any other publication. Articles are written to demonstrate best practices and key business strategies to call center managers. Each issue contains original research and insight with absolutely no advertising.


This issue's cover article features Knight Ridder's Regional Call Centers. Find out how Knight Ridder has pursued technology to maximize efficiencies and increased agent retention through peer monitoring, competency-based training, and restructured compensation.

Another article features Telvista, formerly CompUSA, which has integrated quality monitoring efforts with an e-learning product from Witness Systems. Agents scoring below threshold on call monitoring areas receive the appropriate e-learning modules at their desktops.

We also feature a profile of Precision Response Corporation, the nation's second largest outbound teleservices company. Find out how PRC hires and retains agents and stays ahead of the technology curve to provide superior service for clients.

CCE-J subscribers include "best in class" call center operations like HSN, Microsoft, Bell Canada, Chase Bank, Duke Power, New York Times, and AAA. Subscribe by phone or fax with your credit card or use our secure order form at www.callcenterejournal.com.
