Enclosed is an omnibus worksheet for Moriah Properties, Ltd.  You will see that additional performance assurance has been issued by Moriah to cover all current and future trading up to 10/01/2002.  Please prepare the confirm and forward to the financial confirms group, with a copy to me.  

Thanks,
