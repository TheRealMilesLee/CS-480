Playboy seeks 'Women of Enron' 
 
Magazine invites current and former employees to pose 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
 
HOUSTON, March 25 - Playboy is hoping to entice some of the women who lost
their shirts in the Enron scandal to reveal a little bit more. 

THE MAGAZINE IS putting together a "Women of Enron" pictorial and is
inviting employees past and present to send snapshots of themselves in
bikinis if they wish to pose.

       "This is an opportunity for them to do something fun in the midst of
the turmoil that's going on in their lives. These are women who are out of a
job," Playboy spokeswoman Elizabeth Norris said. "We are offering what you
could view as a part-time job, or what might turn into a new career."

       Plenty of women at the heart of scandals have appeared on Playboy's
pages, including televangelist mistress Jessica Hahn.   
 
       "That's rich," said Deborah DeFforge, co-chairwoman of the Severed
Enron Employees Coalition. "We've had so much depressing news or stressful
news, and then to all of a sudden come up with something like that, it's
kind of cute."

       DeFforge said she would not pose, but added: "I'm sure there are some
in the younger set who would be perfect."
