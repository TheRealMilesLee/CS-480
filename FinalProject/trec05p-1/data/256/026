 FROM:Mr Alhaji  Adams  Azum,  AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT.
 INTERNATIONAL BANK OF AFRICA (IBA),
 OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO.
   Dear Friend,
                                           (TOP SECRET)=20
 I am Mr Alhaji  Adams  Azum, the director in charge of auditing and ac=
counting section
 of International Bank Of Africa(IBA) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Afr=
ica
 with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a busine=
ss transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of=
 the transaction .
=20
 During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came=
 across
 a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on Oc=
tober 31st 1999 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his a=
ccount with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody eith=
er from his family or relation before our discovery to this development=
.
 The said amount was U.S $22.2M (twenty two million two hundred thousan=
d
 United States dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your imp=
ressive information through the Burkina-faso chamber of foreign relatio=
ns here in Ouagadougou Burkina-faso.
 Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the=
 bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and tr=
ansfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and direct=
ives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indic=
ate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit your se=
lf to this great business opportunity.
 In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position i=
n this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to opera=
te a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side =
during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the ac=
tual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forwa=
rd claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Ban=
k and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be=
 re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification=
 and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the wh=
ole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.
 I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.=
 On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% =
of the total sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take c=
are of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also tel=
ephone bills, while 65% will be for me and my partners. Please, you hav=
e been adviced to keep "top secret" as I am still in service and intend=
 to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.
 I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you c=
onfirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your countr=
y for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previousl=
y indicated and further investment, either in your country or any count=
ry you advice us to invest in. All other necessary information will be =
sent to you when I hear from you.
 Yours faithfully,
 Mr. Alhaji  Adams  Azum.
