Hey Lisa,

Just wanted to shoot you an e-mail before more days go by... I would definitely like to get together with you. When looks good for you? Let me know or perhaps we can grab a coffee tomorrow morning and figure out an evening (either weekday or weekend) that works. 

Hope to catch up with you soon!

ciao bella,
Laura
