Mollie,

This morning I talked to one of the Oregon Women's basketball Assistant Coaches and she asked if I would like tickets to the Women's NIT Championship game. The game is Oregon vs. Houston. It will be played tomorrow evening, Wednesday, March 27, at the UofO basketball arena (Mac Court, affectionately know as "The Pit"). 

I told her I would call her back. I can not attend but if someone here in the office would like me to call and see if I can tickets I will call her back. These are team tickets and I suspect they will go fast. If someone is interested I need to know how many tickets they need. 


Jeff
