Dear Sir, 

                   ASSISTANCE

Kindly allow me the modesty of introducing myself. I am GEORGE KABILA,the=

son of the former head of state/ president of Congo-Kinshasha (then calle=
d
Zaire) Mr. Laurent Desire Kabila.

I am contacting you in other to ask for your assistance on this confident=
ial
Business proposal with full financial benefit for both of us. 

Before I go into further details please be informed that I am writing wit=
hout
any other person(s) pre-knowledge of my contacting you on this transactio=
n.


Therefore I will appreciate same attitude to be maintained all through.

I have the sum of USD20.7Million from a secret sale of Diamond by my fath=
er
before he was assassinated by one of his body guard (Rashid) on January
16th 2001, which I will like you to receive on my behalf due to Security
reasons, as my narration below will explain. 

But before I continue be well informed that your share in this transactio=
n
has been calculated as 15% of the total sum of USD$20.7M, 5% for expenses=

and the rest for my family and I.
My father as a real African traditionalist was a polygamist thereby havin=
g
married to so many wives, and my mother being the second wife of my fathe=
r,
My step brother Joseph, who is currently the  president of my country, is=

the son of the first wife and he does not have any knowledge about this
deal. 

Already president Joseph is using his power to colonize all the money and=

private property, which my late father left behind for the entire family.=



Now my mother and I are left with nothing in the inheritance of my late
father's wealth. Our situation is seriously critical that we need your as=
sistance
to help us receive this money overseas for proper investment. 

Let me quickly assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free because=

the diamond sales are packaged from  the unset in a pattern that shows no=

direct trace or linkage with us (Kabila family). At present the money is
deposited and is secured with a holding company under deposit account. 

I am waiting for your swift and favourable response, and in case you have=

any question(s), do not hesitate to contact me. 

My alternative email address is: georgekabila2002cg@mail.com

Best Regards.

George Kabila
