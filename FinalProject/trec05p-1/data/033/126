The numbers I sent you DID include Alliance. Do you want the numbers excluding Alliance? I could do that also.
Please let me know.

has there been a change in the way we are calculating field receipts for Alberta that supports the significant month on month growth.  Do we now include Alliance in here ? It appears to be a dramatic increase relative to historicals.

Looks good.. I will review. Is there a chart on the cumulative Alberta Field receipt levels.... i.e. 13.2 bcf/day?

Thanks, 

BT
