Shelley,
 
For the guardianship...can you pick someone but not have it notarized?  It does not have to be an agreement that is signed between the two of you (ignore what I wrote on the list I gave you).  It is just to make clear that you guys have thought about this and have a plan just in case.  You can officially do something later.  For now ie.  "we plan to use either ____ or _____ if something happens..."
 
Also, be sure and request a packet from Ginger.  The other family, Gras, that I am working with has this.  There are forms for the medical, etc.  
 
Apparently, Ginger wants two things.  There needs to be a Texas approved homestudy and then a shorten version that is under 5 pages to send to Kaz.   Ms. Gras was telling me this over the phone today and is going to send me the requirements.  
 
Hope you were not too tired today.
 
Suzanne
