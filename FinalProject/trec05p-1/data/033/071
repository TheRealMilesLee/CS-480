 A personal attorney to our late client

 Nigeria. Mr James Harrison a well known Philanthropist,before he   
 died,he made a {WILL} stating  that $1,0M (One million U.S. dollars  
 only) should  be donated to any Philanthropist of our choice overseas.

 We have made a random draw and your name and e-mail address was    
 picked as the beneficiatry to  this {WILL}. I am particularly 
 interested in securing this money from the Bank, because they have issued a
notice
 instructing us to produce the beneficiary of this {WILL} within two 
 weeks or else   the money will be credited to the Government treasury as per

 law here. It is  my utmost desire to execute the {WILL} of our late 
 client.

 You are required to contact me immediately to start the process
 of sending this money to any of your designated official account.
 I urge you  to contact me immediately for further details bearing in 
 mind  that the Bank has   given us a date limit.
