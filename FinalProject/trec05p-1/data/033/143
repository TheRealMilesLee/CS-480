on 8/1 Larry Campbell sent me an email indicating he'd spoken with folks at the AZ chapter of The Nature Conservancy.  Jean Calhoun there said TNC had completed and published two of 3 studies of major ecological regions near our proposed pipeline.  

How do we get copies of the studies to our guys at ENSR?

thanks
