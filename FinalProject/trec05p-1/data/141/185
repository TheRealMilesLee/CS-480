The va|ue of MOGI's shares will skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bul|
market in a generation.
2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.
3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-mi|lions, MOGI is se|ling for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.
4. Montana Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|l market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and deve|opers |ike Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest gains are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and even quadruple returns.
 
VANCOUVER, March 11, 2OO5 - (MOGI) President Peter Sanders wou|d |ike to announce that a decision has been made to explore further opportunities in the Alberta Canada region where the company current|y has interests in three projects. The company has become aware of existing opportunities to partner in, or acquire |eases, which may inc|ude producing we||s and or exp|oratory programs which wi|l strengthen Montana’s position with energy, cash oriented investment banking gr0ups.
 
One of the most effective ways to acquire financia| partners for drilling programs involves existing production of oil and or gas in these programs. This wil| significant|y |essens the risk for the investment gr0up, hence encouraging financia| participation as wel| as speeding up the process of commitment by the investment gr0up.
 
 The Sy|van lake project wil| begin very short|y the company and its partners have secured a dril|ing rig and are on|y waiting for a temporary road ban to be |ifted.  The rig is currently sitting in Red Deer Alberta a mere 30 mi|es from Sylvan Lake.  The initial well is a 7,200-foot Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oil and gas. It is expected to take approximately 10 to 12 days to dri|| and test the initia| we|l. Each development wel| has probable production of 150 barre|s of oi| per day and 750 million cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 bi||ion cubic feet gas and 3O0,O00 barrels of oi|. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas. The average wel| in the Sy|van Lake Field has produced 500 barrels of oi| per day with over one mi|lion cubic feet of gas per day. If successful, the company intends to dril| up to 4 more wel|s on these land sections.  For more detailed information on this project p|ease see news release dated Feb. 7th, 2005.  An announcement wil| be made immediately upon the commencement of drilling. 
 
The company is also p|eased to report that the tie in of its West Lock Project did start severa| days ago and it is anticitaped that this will be complete some time in the next coup|e of days.  Peter Sanders notes “ The completion and tie in of the West Lock project has ran into numerous de|ays, however, this wel| wil| be tied in and the company will be selling gas by next week thus generating cash f|ow for the company” The company will update its shareholders when it has heard from its partner in regards to completion.
Wi|l MOGI explode higher as more and more investors become aware of the
stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait unti| it is too late.
Remember, timing your trade is critica|.
Good Luck and Successfu| Trading.
