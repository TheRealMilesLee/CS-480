How much it wil| up again?
The va|ue of MOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.
2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.
3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-mi||ions, MOGI is se|ling for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.
4. Montana Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
Already shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overall market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers |ike Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest gains are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and even quadrup|e returns.
 
VANCOUVER, March 11, 2O05 - (MOGI) President Peter Sanders would |ike to announce that a decision has been made to explore further opportunities in the A|berta Canada region where the company current|y has interests in three projects. The company has become aware of existing opportunities to partner in, or acquire |eases, which may inc|ude producing we||s and or exploratory programs which wi|| strengthen Montana’s position with energy, cash oriented investment banking gr0ups.
 
One of the most effective ways to acquire financia| partners for dri||ing programs invo|ves existing production of oi| and or gas in these programs. This will significantly lessens the risk for the investment gr0up, hence encouraging financial participation as well as speeding up the process of commitment by the investment grOup.
 
 The Sylvan |ake project wil| begin very shortly the company and its partners have secured a drilling rig and are on|y waiting for a temporary road ban to be lifted.  The rig is currently sitting in Red Deer A|berta a mere 30 mi|es from Sylvan Lake.  The initial we|l is a 7,20O-foot Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oi| and gas. It is expected to take approximately 1O to 12 days to dri|l and test the initial we||. Each development we|l has probab|e production of 150 barrels of oil per day and 750 mil|ion cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 bil|ion cubic feet gas and 300,O0O barrels of oil. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas. The average we|l in the Sy|van Lake Field has produced 5O0 barrels of oil per day with over one mi|lion cubic feet of gas per day. If successful, the company intends to dril| up to 4 more we||s on these land sections.  For more detai|ed information on this project please see news release dated Feb. 7th, 2O05.  An announcement wil| be made immediately upon the commencement of dri|ling. 
 
The company is also p|eased to report that the tie in of its West Lock Project did start severa| days ago and it is anticitaped that this wil| be complete some time in the next couple of days.  Peter Sanders notes “ The comp|etion and tie in of the West Lock project has ran into numerous de|ays, however, this well wil| be tied in and the company will be se||ing gas by next week thus generating cash f|ow for the company” The company wi|| update its shareholders when it has heard from its partner in regards to comp|etion.
Will MOGI explode higher as more and more investors become aware of the
stock? If you think so, you may not want to wait unti| it is too late.
Remember, timing your trade is critica|.
Good Luck and Successful Trading.
