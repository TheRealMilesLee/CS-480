Dear Cartoon Bank Member,

I'm going to take 20% off the price of our New Yorker Vintage Cover prints, 
and here's why:

When I woke up this morning, the sun was shining and there was no 
suspicious-looking powder in my mail.

So I threw away my hazmat suit (which had just come back from the cleaners) 
and started to think that things were getting back to normal even if it was 
a "new normal" on its way to becoming an old normal once an even newer 
normal came along.

All this put me in a good mood and now I want to put you in a good mood too.

So throw away your hazmat suit and check out our new Vintage Cover 
Collection online at http://www.cartoonbank.com/covers_1.asp.

You can buy our cover prints framed and matted or just matted (but the 
framed versions are really spectacular and with 20% off, a super great deal.)

Unfortunately, the Pilgrims couldn't buy these unique artistic 
reproductions.  They had to hang colored corn on their walls.

But with our new Vintage Cover collection, you can save the corn for the 
table.

Decorate with cover prints instead.

Visit our site at www.cartoonbank.com.  Our on-line display features a 
popular selection of New Yorker covers from 1925 to 1992.  Some are moody 
and artistic, others are whimsical, even hilarious.  All are perfect moments 
in time.

If you don't see the cover or artist you want, give us a call at 
1-800-897-8666 and we'll search our office database.  While not all covers 
are available, most are.    And with hundreds to choose from, I'm confident 
we can find one that will make you feel as good as I'm feeling right now!

Happy Thanksgiving to you and the family.

Normally yours,

Bob

P.S.  I went to visit my 94-year-old mother the other day.  I told her that 
her beloved granddaughter has a new pony.  "Pony!  What does she need that 
for!" she snorted. "I prefer live humans."  And that's the beauty of The 
Cartoon Bank's Vintage Cover Collection! You can get a beautiful artistic 
print of a pony or of humans! So what could be bad?
