Here are the EnronOnline numbers for today as of 3:19 pm.  There has been a drop-off, but it has not been too dramatic.

	Transactions:  4806 (down from 5601)
	Number of Users:  871 (down from 960)
	Counterparties:  229 (down from 256)

The final transaction count will be around 5,000.  I'm still waiting to chat with Louise regarding this information to respond to reporter questions.

Eric
