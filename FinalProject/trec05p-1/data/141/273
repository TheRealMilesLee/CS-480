Mike, after we corrected the CGPR-KINGSGATE, your P&L decreased to (40,473).  The P&L did not change by much because you do not have a position at Kingsgate.  The gain that was seen in physical current month MTM value was offset by a loss in transport revenue.  The estimate was mainly off because of the price curveshift which is taken directly from TDS.  The difference between my estimate and the actual price curveshift totaled approximately 650,000.  Let me know if you have any more questions Mike.  Thanks.
