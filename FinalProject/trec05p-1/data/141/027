Hey, got your voicemail.  Sorry I didn't email you sooner.  Funny what you said in the voicemail, cause tomorrow is actually my last day at Enron.  I just gave my notice last Monday.  I'm going to be doing some accounting and tax work (reporting, not compliance) for a Fortune 100 energy company (can't tell you from this email address) in downtown Houston.  In the Fall, I'll probably go at night and work on an MBA, since I got the CPA out of the way.  My thinking is that I can eventually move out of accounting and do some financial stuff.  If it don't work out, I can always call Henry and Aziz back.
 
If I don't see you before I leave, let's definitely keep in touch.  My personal email address is huxen@huxen.com <mailto:huxen@huxen.com> (yep, that's real... coming up with a website too as soon as I think of an idea).
 
Let me give you my phone info as well.  What part of town you staying at?

Take it easy,
 
Ben
