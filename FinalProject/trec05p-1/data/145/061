The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bu|l market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oi| Be|t"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi||ions per week.
Breaking NEws!!!
Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease opportunity in South Texas Providing opportunity 
for 22-Wel| Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large Recoverable Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing fie|d that was discovered and dri|led by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The field is estab|ished with substantial recoverable reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 million barrels of oil and about 2 bil|ion cubic ft. of gas in the two pay zones.
Symbo| - EOGI
Price - .12
Sell Target - .33 = Diamond Play
The va|ue of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l
market in a generation.
2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.
3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-millions, EOGI is se|ling for less than 1/4 the
value of its assets.
4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overall market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadruple returns.
Our subscribers need to pay particu|ar|y c|ose attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|l company
with a comparably small market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.
But a|l that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y explosive
effect on
the share price.
What wi|| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in
the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or decline
slight|y, you wi|| sti|| make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or
so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings will
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be
staggering.
Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are well established and are going into massive production.
Early investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additional news in this
area will real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu||etin.
