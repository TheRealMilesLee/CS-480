Internet Daily 
for Friday, November 23, 2001
by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com


Amazon.com back to normal

Amazon.com said its customers have ordered almost 9 million 
items in the past two weeks, "sending a clear message: it's back 
to shopping as usual this holiday season." Items related to 
Harry Potter account for 20% of the top sellers, and sales of 
DVD players are 75% ahead of last year.

AOL France sees flat-rate approval

Internet users in France may not have to count the minutes and 
the francs much longer. The chief of AOL France, a unit of AOL 
Time Warner's America Online, was reported Friday to be 
expecting the country's regulators to allow Internet service 
providers to offer flat-rate pricing. Currently, Web users pay 
by the minute. "I think it will be a battle won," AOL France's 
Stephane Treppoz said, according to Dow Jones. But he does not 
expect much of an impact in the marketplace. Troppez, speaking 
at a broadband industry meeting in Montpelier, France, said, 
"Users don't feel they need to move to broadband, they're 
satisfied with low band." He did point out however that when 
flat-rate pricing was offered in the U.K. a year ago, average 
daily online use jumped from 20 minutes to an hour.

Lycos workers ordered home for Christmas

The almost 800 U.S.-based employees of Terra Lycos are required 
to take five days off between Dec. 24 and Dec. 31, either as 
vacation or unpaid leave. The move is aimed at cutting costs, 
according to a report from Dow Jones in Madrid, Spain. A company 
spokesman said only key personnel will stay on the job.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
You've got pink slips

Eastman Kodak's PhotoNet, which provided services to AOL Time 
Warner's America Online, is being shut down. About 135 employees 
in Israel and the U.S. are being laid off by the shutdown of the 
PictureVision unit, according to Israel's Business Arena 
publication. There was no indication AOL's "You've Got Pictures" 
service would be affected by the move. Kodak said it would 
consider transferring key employees in its Israel office to its 
New York headquarters.
