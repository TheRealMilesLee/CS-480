Campbell,

We had a discrepancy with WESCO on our checkouts for 9/23/2001.  WESCO shows all 100 MW with the following path:

SCEG-SCEGW135074F50/50-SCEG-DYPMI - WESCO ---E--- MORGAN  - SOCO-SOCOW/S

WESCO does not recognize the schedule with the following path for 25MW:

MDU-CARGILL-MAPPW-AMRNW-TVAW-CARG-SCEG-DYPMI - WESCO ---E--- MORGAN  - SOCO-SOCOW/S  

We both agree that 100 MW should sink at SOCO, however, they show all 100 coming from SCEG into SOCO, and we show 75 from SCEG to SOCO and 25 from MDU to SOCO.  Let me know if I need to make any changes.

Thanks,

Jason Berlin
