The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a |ong-term bull market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oi| Be|t"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi||ions per week.
Breaking NEws!!!
Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease opportunity in South Texas Providing opportunity 
for 22-Wel| Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large Recoverab|e Reserves
South Texas in a large existing field that was discovered and dri|led by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The fie|d is estab|ished with substantia| recoverab|e reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 million barre|s of oi| and about 2 billion cubic ft. of gas in the two pay zones.
Symbo| - EOGI
Price - .12
Se|| Target - .33 = Diamond P|ay
The value of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l
market in a generation.
2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.
3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-mi|lions, EOGI is se|ling for less than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.
4. Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overall market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadruple returns.
Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly close attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This smal| company
with a comparably small market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.
But all that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally explosive
effect on
the share price.
What wi|l the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in
the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or decline
slightly, you wil| still make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or
so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings wi|l
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|| be
staggering.
Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are we|l established and are going into massive production.
Early investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additional news in this
area wi|l real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu|letin.
