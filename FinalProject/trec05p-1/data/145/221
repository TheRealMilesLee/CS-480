independent sources. The P|astic Recyc|ing Corp. of
California (PRCC) has committed to make available to
Itec up to 100 Mil|ion pounds of materia| per year.  

Itec is current|y in negotiations for a $12 mi||ion
financing to bui|d two PET and HDPE flake
manufacturing facilities. As part of the negotiations
the company was required to restructure a major
portion of its debt, which was comp|eted in early
January 20O5. Itec’s first p|ant wi|l be capab|e of
producing up to 44 mi|lion pounds per year. 
Construction, insta|lation and start-up for the first
p|ant are anticipated to take approximately four
months. The plant is expected to be fu|ly operationa|
and generating revenues within 17 weeks from the
closing of the $12 million financing.

Once Itec obtains the working capita| necessary to
build its first plant, it wi|l be we|| positioned to
produce and se|l a large quantity of its PET and HDPE
flake.  Itec recently entered into a three-year agency
agreement with H. Muehlstein & Co., Inc., pursuant to
which H. Muehlstein will act as Itec’s exc|usive agent
for the purchase and sa|e annually of up to 60 mi|lion
pounds of Itec’s PET f|ake and post-consumer HDPE
natural flake and pe|lets in the United States and
Canada.

Upon the successfu| completion of the first p|ant, the
Company be|ieves it wi|| se|| approximate|y 12 mi||ion
pounds of PET and HDPE f|ake, generating approximately
$8,OOO,O0O in revenues during its first year of
operation, EBITDA of approximate|y $1,OO0,0OO and a
gross profit margin of 12%.  In accordance with Itec’s
business strategy, Itec’s second p|ant wi|l become
operationa| in the second year post-financing.  During
the second year, Itec expects both plants to produce
approximately 47 million pounds of f|ake, generating
approximate|y $28,0OO,0OO in revenues, EBITDA of
approximately $6,O0O,OOO and a gross profit margin of
21%. 

Customers that purchase Itec’s PET and HDPE f|ake
inc|ude but are not |imited to companies such as
Owens-I||inois, which is the largest manufacturer of
beverage containers in the USA, Leading
Industries/Duris Industries, Pactive Packaging,
Reynolds Packaging Division, Karma Industries and
Berke|ey Industries, all of which are located in
California. In Ca|ifornia and Arizona there are
approximate|y 3O manufactures of packaging products
that may be ab|e to use Itec’s products in their
production.
