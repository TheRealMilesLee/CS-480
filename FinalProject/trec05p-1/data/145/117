Jeff: We have received and reviewed your letter and take exception to many of the points you pursued (including your "self-inflicted" reference). In addition, it is my understanding that our Chief Financial Officer, Jeff McMahon, spoke at length today with your client, Skip McGee, and shared with him our reasons for disagreement with Lehman's position and alerting him that Enron would not be making payment tomorrow according to your terms.

I will be in the office tomorrow around 10am New York time and can be reached at 713-853-7897.
Thank you for your time.
Jordan
