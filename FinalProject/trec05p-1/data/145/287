Rick,

Some changes are appropriate regarding the Canada Gov't Affairs Group's use of Enron Canada support staff and the allocation of their salaries to the Gov't Affairs given things like Aleck's departure, Fino's use of support, etc. and the need to generally reduce costs:    

						Current Allocation			Proposed after Dec 1/01
Lisa Assaf - Toronto  				50% of $46,000/year			$0
Sara Butt - Calgary (Fino)			25% of $38,000/year			$0
Linda Sietzema - Calgary (Rob/Randy)		50% of $44,000/year			$0

Megan Scott - Calgary (Rob/Randy)							100% of $28,000/year		

This plan will reduce the Enron Canada support staff allocation to Gov't Affairs from its current level of $58,000/year to $28,000/year until end of Q1 2002 when I plan to put a new Gov't Affairs person in Toronto that will need some level of support (say 25% of $46,000).

Are you okay with this?  Please confirm and then I will proceed to have Enron Canada revise its present allocation to Gov't Affairs.

Regards,

Rob
