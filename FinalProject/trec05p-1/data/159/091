Jeff:

Remember the Centanna Storage Contract you reviewed a couple of weeks back.  It has never been signed I'm waiting on a few replacement pages from Duke.  Given the Bankruptcy filling is there anything special I need to do?  Do I need special approval?  Duke is being very cooperative and is trying to work with Enron to meet our needs.  If the term needs to be reduced they are willing to do whatever it takes.  I would appreciate your input as to what to do or whom I should talk.

	Thanks, Jim
