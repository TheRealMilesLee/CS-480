Who can I work with to get the first names of the individuals listed for Gas Trading, as well as the split between structuring/fundamentals/trading? (I see some of the latter in the name column, is that the entire group? it would be helpful to have them grouped separately.) In a lot of cases there are several listing for some names, and they appear to be IT people. We're building a plan based on title, so that's why I need this info. Thanks!
