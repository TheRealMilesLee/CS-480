Kay,

The changes look fine.  Two questions, (i) with regards to the PUCHA opinion, does "registered" holding company have significance versus simply a holding company, and (ii) I read opinion #4 very narrowly to only relate to filings related to the bankruptcy petition (the "Cases") and transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents.  There should really be no significant issues that arise under this particular opinion.  Is my interpretation on track?  Thanks.

Clem

Clement, 

Please take a quick look at this.  The "subject to bankruptcy court approval" was removed since these actions were approved yesterday.

Thanks,
