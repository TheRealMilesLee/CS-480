Bill and I had a cc with Frank Kelly and Steve Stojic.  I believe that we are all of the opinion that we should file any contracts that materially deviate based on the new definition.  We discussed alternatives (there were none) and ways to mitigate exposure and possible exposure.  We probably should talk before tomorrow's meeting.  I'll get Ann and Sharon to set something up.
