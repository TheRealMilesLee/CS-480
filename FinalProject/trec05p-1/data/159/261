Please forward this note to the Northern and Transwestern customer teams to insure they know what to do with any physical checks that may come addressed to Gas Logistics for the payment of transportation services or the settlement of imbalances.  
 
Every day before lunch time, Josh will stop by and pick up any checks received by Gas Logistics and deliver them to Tracy Geaccone for timely delivery to Treasury.
 
Rick

Rick, 
   Until further notice,  please collect all checks received by Gas Logistics each morning and deliver to Tracy's office by noon each day. Checks will then be delivered to Treasury by 1:30 PM for same day deposit. Please forward this message to other persons/groups which might receive checks on behalf or NNG and TW. Thanks!
