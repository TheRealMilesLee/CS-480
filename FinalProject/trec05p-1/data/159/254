From the Desk of: 
Mr.Chuks Okoye
Manager{Commercial Banking (South)}
Orient Bank Plc, Nigeria.
E-mail :felix_okoye2000@yahoo.com

Dear Friend,
My name is Mr.Felix Chuks Okoye {Commercial Banking
(South)} with Orient Bank Plc,Nigeria. Lagos-Nigeria.I came to know about=

you in my private search for a reliable person/company to handle a
confidential transaction on behalf of my Colleagues and myself.
l write in respect of a foreign customer with A/C number:14-2558-2004,who=

unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of
Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including hi=
s
wife and only daughter leaving nobody to claim the money. You shall read
more news about the crash on visiting this site;http://www.cnn.com/2000/U=
S/02/
01/alaska.airlines.list/ The owner of this account Mr.Morris Thompson an
American and great industrialist and a resident of Alaska.
Since the death of this our customer Mr.Morris Thompson, I have kept a cl=
ose
monitoring of the deposit records and accounts since then. Nobody has com=
e
forward to claim the money in this A/C as
next of kin to the late Mr.Morris Thompson. The total amount in the accou=
nt
US$9.7 million and it is a domiciliary escrow bank account.It is only
an insider,the account owner or a next of kin who has information about t=
he
account that could produce the Code or password of the deposit
particulars. Also the funds can only be released to a foreigner.
As it stands now, there is nobody in the position to produce the needed i=
nformation
other than my very self-considering my
position in the bank.Based on the fact that Mr. Morris Thompson's family
perished in the same flight accident, leaving no one to put claim of the
deposit as the next of kin,so I am seeking for your co-operation to prese=
nt
you as the next of kin to late Mr.Morris Thompson,and arrange for the rel=
ease
of
the funds to your honour for our mutual benefit.
If there is more delay in moving this money out, this
money will be pushed to the Treasury of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
I am willing to share this money with you in the ratio of 60 -40%. You sh=
all
have 40% of the funds and I shall share the rest with my partner at
the bank.I hope this is a fair sharing?
I look forward to hearing from you urgently so that we
can proceed accordingly.Kindly forward your urgent response to
this  my private e-mail { felix_okoye2000@yahoo.com }
Thanks and best Regards.
Mr.Felix Chuks Okoye
{Commercial Banking (South)}.
